            "[<p>I had no time to think, pause or consider before I came to be enveloped in a soft, white light. A blinding flash impacting not just my eyes but seemingly my whole body.</p>, <p>Sensation fell gradually away as I tried to gather my thoughts. What had happened? Where was I? I think I made myself dinner, my parents hadn’t been home, again. I was eating in my room, at my desk maybe? Then there had been ... white?</p>, <p>I can’t tell how long I’ve been here, floating in this gentle light. Has it been ten days? Or only ten minutes? The light surrounds me, enveloping me like a warm blanket.</p>, <p>Sound begins to swell like a wave in the distance. It rushes toward me and just when washes over me I hear a voice.</p>, <p>[Welcome Anthony]</p>, <p>Well thank you! These are the kinds of good manners that make me feel warm inside.</p>, <p>[you have died]</p>, <p>Dammit!</p>, <p>What do you mean I died, disembodied voice? How on earth are you speaking anyway? Come to think of it, how on earth am I hearing you? Do I even have ears right now?!</p>, <p>So if I died, is this heaven? I mean, it’s comfortable enough but I’m not sure if I want to stay here forever you know?</p>, <p>[Be calm, you will soon awaken to experience life again in a new world]</p>, <p>This voice feels somewhat familiar, a deep and gruff intonation that is comforting yet full of wisdom? Is it that legendary bearded figure, dressed all it white? Worshipped with devotion all over the Earth?</p>, <p>Could it be you?</p>, <p>Gandalf?</p>, <p>[You will be reborn on the world of Pangera]</p>, <p>[Destiny and luck shall determine your fate]</p>, <p>Hold on a moment, Gandalf! This ... This sounds kind of cool doesn’t it? Reborn into another world? Adventure, peril and opportunity around each corner? Will there be magic? Girls?!</p>, <p>Whoa there ... hold on there, me. Need to be calm. Focus and listen to Lord Gandalf!</p>, <p>[You will be reborn with the following status:]</p>, <p>Here it comes!</p>, <p>[Level: 1]</p>, <p>So game like!</p>, <p>[Stats:]</p>, <p>Might: 15</p>, <p>Toughness: 12</p>, <p>Cunning: 25</p>, <p>Will: 18</p>, <p>HP: 30</p>, <p>MP: 0</p>, <p>Oh ho! I sound strong. MP is zero though? Is it because my spirit is lacking? Why are you judging me like this Gandalf?</p>, <p>[Skills: Digging level 1; Acid Shot Level 1; Grip Level 3; Bite Level 2]</p>, <p>Okay! Skills! This is exciting! Just ... bite? Acid? Aren’t these skills a little... strange? What about destruction magic or inter-dimensional spirit summoning?</p>, <p>[Species: Hatchling Ant Worker (Formica)]</p>, <p>....</p>, <p>Oi.</p>, <p>Oiiiiii.</p>, <p>What the heck was that Gandalf?! Ant? Not just an ant but a hatchling worker ant?! This isn’t the glorious rebirth I had in mind Lord Gandalf! Was I lacking in virtue during my previous life? Was I too cruel to my friends? That can’t be so, I didn’t have any friends!</p>, <p>[You have one Skill point and one Biomass available]</p>, <p>[Go forth and forge your own path]</p>, <p>An ant path? Forge your mother, Gandalf!</p>, <p>At this moment, I sensed a change the light surrounding me. Gradually, it began to condense, shrinking and squeezing against me. Simultaneously it began to take form. Slowly the features and details of my new body were taking shape.</p>, <p>Sadly those features were not to my liking!</p>, <p>Six legs, two antennae, strong mandibles and a large abdomen. This is definitely the body of an ant.</p>, <p>After what felt like only a few minutes my shape was fully formed, my body, still white and somewhat translucent had coalesced around my consciousness.</p>, <p>I was now a fully formed ant.</p>, <p>What the hell am I supposed to do now Gandalf?! I may have kept ants as pets, but that doesn’t mean I know what one is supposed to do?! Is that all it takes is it? Pet ants means ant rebirth?</p>, <p>First I suppose I’ll try and get my bearings. The first thing I notice is that my vision is terrible. I appear to be somewhere quite dark but a faint blue glow can be seen coming from a wall in front of me, but the details are terribly blurry. Every time I turn my head my vision seems to swim, as if the colours are washed away with water before settling again.</p>, <p>There is a sinking feeling in my... abdomen? Most ants have very poor vision, some are even completely blind. At least I’m not that unlucky. I’ll have to adjust to the other senses I have to compensate for my crappy vision!</p>, <p>Of course I mean my antennae! I should, if I recall right, be able to use them to smell the air and detect movement from air currents. I diligently start waving my still white feelers to see if I can sense anything.</p>, <p>Ooooo. This is a bit different.</p>, <p>I’m detecting a few smells I can’t identify. The air here certainly seems a bit stale, which makes sense if I’m underground.</p>, <p>But wait. Where are all my ant brethren? Ants usually communicate by pheromones and their sense of smell right? My fellow colony mates should be around here ready to welcome their new comrade shouldn’t they?! Why can’t I find them?</p>, <p>Wait! I’m detecting a whiff of something nearby. I turn left and frantically wave my antennae in this new direction. Yes. Something that smells much like myself is nearby. By piecing together information from my senses I can work out that I’m in a long tunnel. Across one of the walls there is a faintly pulsing blue light. The tunnel seems to be a combination of rock walls with dirt sections.</p>, <p>Very gradually I begin to proceed towards the scent of my ally. My six legs begin to move, hesitantly at first and then with growing confidence.</p>, <p>I’m starting to hear something as I approach a curve in the tunnel ahead. It’s a little hard to make out, like a crunching noise?</p>, <p>Not to fear my fellow ant buddy! Whatever your task may be, I am here to assist, for the glory of the colony!</p>, <p>Antennae waving furiously I approach the curve and poke my head around the corner.</p>, <p>I see movement. An ant is lying flat on its back, legs slowly waving jerkily in the air. Mandibles open and snap at air weakly, but that’s not all I see.</p>, <p>Above my brethren I see a long snout open wide, jagged curved teeth revealed within. Two powerful hands grip a weakly struggling ant, lifting it towards those jaws which close with crushing force. The ant victim writhes in silent agony and the predator snaps its jaws a few more times before lifting its head and throwing the food down its gullet.</p>, <p>Nonononononono.</p>, <p>Nope.</p>, <p>What the heck is this?!</p>, <p>Is this some sort of monster walking crocodile lizard beast?! At the end of its body I can see a massive tail swishing across the ground, two strong looking hands are pinning down the body of its prey, my comrade is still twitching and trying to move but is clearly at the end of their strength.</p>, <p>Fortunately the monster has its back to me!</p>, <p>Don’t look at me like that, ally!</p>, <p>What do you want me to do? Fight that giant Croca-beast?! I can tell its easily four or five times my size!</p>, <p>This isn’t the colony, there aren’t any other ants here. No team, no support, no soldiers to protect us workers. What can I possibly do?</p>, <p>Clearly my best strategy in this situation is to ... Flee!</p>, <p>Before it finishes eating and looks for more I have to run!</p>, <p>Tripping and falling over my own legs I turn and scurry back down the tunnel in the direction I came. Run, run, run!</p>, <p>Wait!</p>, <p>What if I run into another of those monsters coming down the tunnel towards me?! That would be game over man, game over!</p>, <p>Think Anthony, think like an ant!</p>, <p>I stop too quickly and tangle my legs up again, causing me to fall in a heap. Hang on a moment?! I do have an option to ensure my safety. What would an ant do? Dig!</p>, <p>I use my feelers and front legs to scan the walls around me as quickly as I can. There! Aha! This section of wall is softer dirt, not rock!</p>, <p>Dig like your life depends on it Anthony! Because it does!</p>, <p>Raising my forelegs I start to scratch madly at the wall. My legs are still white coloured and faintly translucent, too soft to effectively dig! Hold on, ants don’t use their legs to dig anyway. I try opening my mandibles on the front of my face for the first time. In my vision I can see the thick jaws open and snap shut.</p>, <p>I have to dig with my face!</p>, <p>I push my face towards the wall and open my jaws as wide as I can then crunch them shut with all of my strength. My mandibles are yet to harden fully but they are still enough to rip into this dirt wall easily!</p>, <p>Haha!</p>, <p>Frantically I dig without pause, without rest, until I have carved out a small tunnel in the wall large enough to fit myself in and then collapse the entrance, trapping myself in complete black.</p>, <p>If I’m found, I’m dead!</p>, <p>Shivering in my dark hidey hole I begin to ponder my circumstances.</p>, <p>This situation is too strange! A new ant should be born inside the colony, surrounded by allies and protectors, why on Pangera was I born alone in a tunnel with such fearsome beasts! Judging by my poor fellow ant out there I’m not the only one dropped into these hopeless straights.</p>, <p>I can only think of one thing. A raid. Something attacked my home colony and escaped carrying a few unhatched young. A juicy, defenseless food supply to snack on back in their own home tunnels. It may not have even been that giant Croca-beast that conducted the raid, it may have intercepted the creatures that did the deed and stolen their prize.</p>, <p>As a result I was dropped, unseen and managed to hatch successfully, leading to my current position of shaking in the dirt hoping I don’t get found.</p>, <p>I can also dismiss the idea that I am a normal ant, just a few millimeters long. I’ve no idea how large I actually am but I can safely assume I would be a ridiculous size for an ant on Earth. That bi-pedal crocodile-headed beast certainly did not exist on Earth and surely cannot evolve naturally. This evidence, combined with the game like system in this world leads me to believe that it was a monster I saw and that I am also a monster in some underground labyrinth or dungeon.</p>, <p>That’s scary! Do I have some sort of monster core that explorers will come to farm? Do I drop money when I die?!</p>, <p>This is some ridiculous hard mode right here Gandalf!</p>, <p>A little help?</p>, <p>Wait.

            "[<p>The world before the System Descent is mystery to us now, any records of that time disappeared during the Rending or were lost in the centuries since. How did those people judge each other, unable to view themselves with perfect numerical accuracy as we so easily can today?</p>, <p>Was that society a more equitable place? When the worth of a human being can be weighed with such precision, strict roles and structures are easy to maintain, perhaps back then, when the qualities of each individual were more nebulous, it allowed greater freedom, greater choice in a persons' life? Many believe the System elevated us, empowered us to fight back against the great cataclysm, but many of the wise question this narrative, we know what we gained in the Descent, but we can no longer recall what we lost.</p>, <p>Exert from page 15 of \"Ruminations on the pre-Descent society\" by Illarion the heretic.</p>, <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>, <p>Okay. So I have a skill point and a body point to spend? If this is a game-like situation then I would be able to open some sort of menu in order to spend my points and improve myself. How do I access this menu here in my tunnel though?</p>, <p>Erm. Level up!</p>, <p>No, that didn't work.</p>, <p>Escape! Escape key!</p>, <p>… Nothing.</p>, <p>I mean, worth a shot right?</p>, <p>Sigh.</p>, <p>Status!</p>, <p>Whoa!</p>, <p>Name: Anthony</p>, <p>Level: 1</p>, <p>Might:15</p>, <p>Toughness:12</p>, <p>Cunning: 25</p>, <p>Will: 18</p>, <p>HP: 30</p>, <p>MP: 0</p>, <p>Skills: Digging level 1; Acid Shot Level 1; Grip Level 3; Bite Level 2</p>, <p>Species: Hatchling Ant Worker (Formica)</p>, <p>Biomass: 1</p>, <p>Skill Points: 1</p>, <p>Wow, this is really interesting! My status huh?</p>, <p>The first time I saw these numbers I thought they looked high but perhaps they are actually really low? I can't imagine a hatchling ant worker has an impressive status in any way. And what are these skills?</p>, <p>Grip? Does this mean I can hold onto things well?</p>, <p>[Grip: Ability to hold onto surfaces and objects without letting go, for example, walking on walls]</p>, <p>The triumphant return of Lord Gandalf! My lord! My savior! Truly your beard is the most luxurious, your eyebrows the most bristly!</p>, <p>So I have some sort of help system built into the status to explain the skills when I think of them? This is amazing!</p>, <p>So my grip skill improves my ability to hold onto stuff with my six legs, including walking on walls and the ceiling? I totally forgot ants could do that. I'll have to try it as soon as I get out of here, why would you walk on the floor if you had the option to use the wall or roof?</p>, <p>What do my other skills do I wonder?</p>, <p>[Bite: Improves the ability to accurately and forcefully apply a bite using fangs, mandibles or teeth].</p>, <p>[Digging: Provides sub-conscious guidance when digging to increase efficiency and effectiveness].</p>, <p>[Acid shot: assists accuracy when attempting to attack from a distance using a natural acid from the body].</p>, <p>Okaaaaay.</p>, <p>There are many species of ant on earth that were able to shoot formic acid from their rear zone. I must belong to a monstrous species of formic acid spraying ant then. This could be very helpful, it gives me an option to attack without getting too close to my opponent, a course of action that I think would, at the moment, lead to my instantaneous destruction.</p>, <p>So I can bite, crawl on the roof, dig and shoot acid? That doesn't seem like a lot of tools to survive in an environment like this.</p>, <p>What I'm missing most is information. I have no real idea where I am, I have no idea what kind of creatures live in this place other than ants like me and Croca-beasts, I've no idea where the surface is or if the surface even exists in this world. I can't communicate with anything since I'm fairly sure I don't even have vocal chords, so even if I found someone prepared to talk to a monstrous ant, dialogue would be impossible.</p>, <p>This means if I want any information I'll have to get it myself. Out, in the tunnels.</p>, <p>Hmmm.</p>, <p>Scary! That's so scary, Gandalf!</p>, <p>You want me to go out there with who knows how many unknown horrors as a lone little ant monster?! Madness, madness I say!</p>, <p>Phew. Came down Anthony, stay cool. Panic will not help this situation in any way. Stay rational, stay cool, stay alive.</p>, <p>So, the final question is, what can I spend my points on and how?</p>, <p>[Would you like to spend your skill points?]</p>, <p>I would! I absolutely would oh wise and magnificent Gandalf, bringer of hope, bringer of light, may your beard be ever fluffy!</p>, <p>Just like with my status, a window opens within my mind.</p>, <p>Skill points: 1</p>, <p>Biomass: 1</p>, <p>[you can use skill points to purchase new skills or upgrade existing ones]</p>, <p>[Biomass can be spent to improve or modify aspects of your physical, monstrous form]</p>, <p>[Skills available to purchase:</p>, <p>Stealth: cost 1sp, improves your ability to hide and move unseen</p>, <p>Dash: cost 1sp, Increases speed over short distances but increases stamina drain</p>, <p>Slashing attack: cost 1 sp, more accurate and powerful slashing attacks</p>, <p>Chomp: cost 1sp, bites pierce more and are more difficult to shake off</p>, <p>Tunnel sense: cost 1 sp, improves sense of direction when underground]</p>, <p>[Body improvements available to purchase:</p>, <p>Exoskeleton +1: harden your exoskeleton to improve resistance to mundane damage</p>, <p>Mandibles +1: toughen mandibles and improve their ability to pierce</p>, <p>Legs +1: improve agility</p>, <p>Eyes +1: improve eyesight</p>, <p>Antennae +1: increase sensitivity to air current and scent</p>, <p>Acid gland +1: thicken the concentration of internal acid]</p>, <p>This is a lot of options! It's very difficult to choose! I have to think logically here.</p>, <p>Being able to run faster would help be escape my enemies, tunnel sense would make it harder for me to get lost whilst underground, chomp and acid would help me fight more effectively…</p>, <p>I must prioritise my survival. I can only improve and grow here if I can survive. Taking abilities to help me fight would only be suicide, if I attack a monster I can't defeat then it'll be game over straight away, improving my speed will be a dead end if I run into something that is faster than I am. Without information, how am I supposed to know what creatures I can fight and how fast any of them are?</p>, <p>As a newly hatched ant worker, I have to assume I am close to the weakest creature here!</p>, <p>Ok I have made my decision.</p>, <p>Select, Eyes +1 and Stealth!</p>, <p>[Would you like to purchase Eyes +1 and the skill: Stealth?]</p>, <p>Yes, please.</p>, <p>Immediately I can feel a maddening itch burst over my eyes, like a thousand mosquito bites erupting at once.</p>, <p>Gaaah!</p>, <p>Don't do this to me Gandalf! I can't even scratch this itch, I might poke my own eyes out!</p>, <p>Fortunately it doesn't last for long. After a minute I can feel the itch recede. It's hard to tell if my sight has improved here in my dark hiding place but I definitely feel that my eyes are a bit bigger than they were before.</p>, <p>So this is body modification? One minute and bam, you have improved from before? This almost seems like cheating. How many hours of effort would a human on Earth have to put in to improve themselves even a little bit? Even then, it isn't like they could do something like improve their eyesight.</p>, <p>I have to get more of these points! With enough body improvement points I may be able to overcome my natural weakness as a relatively harmless species and live with more security here in these tunnels!</p>, <p>Why would I select stealth and eyesight improvement you may ask?</p>, <p>Excellent question!</p>, <p>If we say that it's too dangerous to assume I can fight anything whilst we also assume it's too dangerous to assume I can run from everything then the only path through which survival can be assured is to not be seen in the first place. If you are seen, you are dead! I have placed my hope in stealth in order to live long enough to learn more about how to survive in this environment!</p>, <p>As for eyesight… You know, having really terrible eyesight sucks! Being used to human vision, it's super disorienting to switch these pathetic ant eyes! If something isn't moving I can barely see it at all! Remember that ants are a communal species, thousands, tens of thousands of weak individuals combine to create something strong. Each individual ant has terrible senses but when acting together they are difficult to hide from.</p>, <p>I am alone, however! How am I supposed to survive when I could trip over a dragon which was having a nap?!</p>, <p>Ridiculous!</p>, <p>I will make improving my eyesight a priority and I won't stop until I can spot a cockroach twitch through five metres of solid stone.</p>, <p>Okay.</p>, <p>I've been hiding here for about half an hour now, with my points spent there is no longer any reason to delay.</p>, <p>Take courage Anthony, advance forth and explore!</p>, <p>Very carefully I scrape away at the dirt that I collapsed to enclose myself. Eventually I clear a narrow opening to the tunnel I was born in and poke my antennae through very slightly.</p>, <p>It feels clear, I can't smell anything and I don't detect any vibrations. Here goes nothing then. Moving quickly now I widen the opening and squeeze myself through. Turning on the spot I can't see anything in either direction, the tunnel stretches into darkness, curving slightly at the edge of my vision.</p>, <p>The path to my right is where I saw the beast eating my brethren, I'd rather not go that way since I know for certain there are threats in that direction, which leaves me with only one choice: go left.</p>, <p>Now to initiate the next phase of my plan!</p>, <p>Very slowly, since I still can't coordinate my six legs very well, I begin to walk towards the wall, then I begin to walk up the wall, then I step onto the roof until finally I am hanging upside down, gripping the roof fiercely with my tiny claws.</p>, <p>Success! By hugging the roof and moving upside down, combined with my new stealth skill I may have a greater chance of remaining undetected and passing unseen!</p>, <p>Muahahaha!</p>, <p>It could just be the blood rushing to my head but suddenly I feel more confident that I did before. Onward Anthony!</p>, <p>Despite my now burning spirit I continue to move cautiously down the tunnel. Using my antennae and front legs to look for solid footholds before gripping hard with my feet and moving forward. This takes a fair bit of concentration so progress is relatively slow but I'm okay with that, every moment that passes without being attacked feels like a small victory to me!</p>, <p>Now that I can see slightly better I can make a little more sense of some of the details I noticed before. All around the tunnel, twisting and branching like vines are glowing blue lines, like veins running through the rock. Some thicker, some thinner, some so thin they can almost not be seen, splitting and reforming endlessly in a random pattern.</p>, <p>Every few minutes a pulse flows through the lines, brightening the entire tunnel momentarily as it flashes through. It feels eerily as if the tunnel were alive, but for some reason, the light feels comforting to me, almost energizing.</p>, <p>Just another thing for me to learn in order to understand in this place.</p>, <p>Illuminated by the glow of the tunnel I can see my carapace has begun to harden and turn black. I recall from my ant keeping hobby that newborn ants have a soft white exoskeleton which gradually hardens and gains colour. Seems like I was huddling in the wall longer that I thought.</p>, <p>After an hour of cautious movement, I follow the tunnel around a curve and before me the tunnel walls fall away into a tremendous cavern.</p>, <p>This is huge! You could fit a few sports fields in here surely?</p>, <p>What's more, through my antennae I can sense fluttering vibrations and a myriad of scents assault me all at once.</p>, <p>Monsters!</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Growls, hisses and the click-clack of claws echo off the walls in the cavern. Waves of vibrations batter my antennae, dizzying me. This cavern swarms with beasts, fighting and moving through what appeared to be a thoroughfare in the part of the cave network.</p>, <p>Quickly as I can, I dart into the cavern, moving towards the dark shelter of a stalactite, hanging like a spear tip from the roof. Flattening myself against the rock I remain still, and cast my eyes around.</p>, <p>The strange blue lines I’d seen pulsing in the walls are here as well, twisting and branching throughout every surface, even winding around the pillars of pointed rock that burst from the ceiling and floor, illuminating the entire space with the same soft blue light.</p>, <p>Nearby, in the center of a clearing, a basin of water, perhaps twenty meters across had formed in the floor of the cavern. Peering closely, I see it’s fed by a steady drip of water from cracks in the ceiling, possibly from a river or aquifer above. The water seems suffused with the blue glow, illuminated from beneath by veins of light in the basin floor.</p>, <p>The thing that makes my poor ant heart leap to my mandibles however, is the menagerie of monsters I see congregating around the pool. What sort of nightmare parade is this Gandalf?! The details are hard to make out thanks to my still crappy vision but thanks to the creatures being so stylishly lit from below as they drink I can see enough.</p>, <p>First let’s address two closest to me, they appear to be a kind of dog, or wolf, each with a reptilian tale extending behind them. Their head features an elongated snout filled with what I imagine to be razor sharp teeth. The two creatures take turns drinking, watching over each other and rumbling warning growls at anything nearby, tails swishing over the cavern floor.</p>, <p>Next to them I can make out another Croca-beast, leaning forward, placing its weight on its front legs, scooping water with its elongated jaws. The other monsters seem to give the beast a bit of clear space, I would too! It seems the creatures here understand to let sleeping dragons lie well enough.</p>, <p>Now that I notice it, it seems there is no conflict around the water pool at all. Perhaps the denizens of this place have established an unspoken truce here at their water source? I’m surprised. I wouldn’t have expected these terrifying creatures to be willing to share space, especially if they can grow stronger by eating Biomass as I can.</p>, <p>Since this is the case I’ll skitter a little closer and try and see better!</p>, <p>Very slowly I approach the pool, one leg moving at a time, keeping my body as flat to the roof as possible. Progress is so slow! If I could sweat then water would be running off me so fast there would be a second drinking pool in this cavern! I test every foothold and sweep my antennae oh so slowly through the air.</p>, <p>[Stealth has reached level 2]</p>, <p>Oh yisssss!</p>, <p>Skill level up! So juicy!</p>, <p>This confirms my suspicion that my skills can be trained by use, in this case my stealth skill has been raised by moving without being noticed by the monsters below me. This gives me a huge opportunity! I can hide here and continuously observe these monsters, moving very slightly the whole time, which will allow me to gain information whilst training my stealth.</p>, <p>Okay, settle down. The worst thing I can do is lose my cool.</p>, <p>I take a few slow deep breaths to calm myself before I continue my approach. One mistake will mean death in this place, I must be cautious three times in everything I do. Combat means instant destruction for me, I can never forget, even for a moment, that being found means being killed.</p>, <p>Steady the ship Anthony!</p>, <p>Eventually I make my way closer to the pool, letting me see the creatures on the other side a little more clearly. What looked like a shifting mound of a creature is now revealed to be a mass of centipede like creatures, twisting and falling over each other as they drink and rear up their bodies to hiss and clack their pointed mandibles.</p>, <p>I can barely make it out, but each centipede seems to have two small arms with pincers, like a crab or scorpion and their long bodies, covered in legs, end in a sharp point.</p>, <p>Disgusting!</p>, <p>These things are massively disgusting Gandalf! There must be ten of them piled on top of each other over there! The way they writhe and twist makes me slightly nauseous. I’ll look away.</p>, <p>The last beast I can see is a small, squat creature with four legs, like a lizard, but with long, stone like spikes rising from its back. Of all the creatures here it looks like the least threatening but since the other creatures are giving it a wide space there must be something about those spikes that make them avoid it.</p>, <p>Even though I’m hiding here, there is one thought that excites me greatly, each of these terrible creatures is a possible harvest of Biomass, the red envelope of XP, waiting for me to reap!</p>, <p>First I have to make preparations. The next few hours pass slowly as I diligently stay over the pool, shifting my position gradually so as to stay hidden, observing the way the creatures move, especially taking care to see where the creatures go after they leave the pool.</p>, <p>The centipedes slither away to the opposite end of the cavern and curiously the Croca-beast does as well. The dogs move into a small tunnel opening in the south end, close the tunnel I emerged from. The spiky lizard wanders off towards a wall and starts to climb up before I lose sight of it in the shadows.</p>, <p>Another wall dweller eh? I’d call you brother if I didn’t have to eat you! Heheheh.</p>, <p>As the creatures leave they are replaced by more slinking out of the shadows and from behind rocks.</p>, <p>After two hours I am finally rewarded.</p>, <p>[Stealth has reached Level 3]</p>, <p>At last! My poor ant claws need a break!</p>, <p>It might seem effortless to hang upside down here but I’m expending energy and not eating anything. I’m tired and hungry. Food will have to wait for now though. It’s still too soon.</p>, <p>I creep back to my tunnel and make my way back into my hidey-hole. Phew! Only when I’m enclosed in this space do I feel safe. Maybe that is the ant coming out in me?</p>, <p>Never mind that! Time to work some more!</p>, <p>I begin to widen the space and I use the excavated dirt to start blocking the tunnel off on the side leading away from the cavern. Using my mandibles to shift the dirt and pressing it down with my body to compact it. It’s strangely soothing, this.</p>, <p>Usually, when a colony is excavating a nest they would pile loose soil around the top to create a mound in order to help keep water out of the nest. I don’t want this for a few reasons, I’m not worried about rain down here and secondly, I don’t want anyone to know there is an ant in here.</p>, <p>So my plan is to try and restrict the tunnel on both sides, leaving only a small gap for me to pass through on the roof. This way the larger creatures will be dissuaded from chasing me here to my hiding place. They could get through if they really wanted to of course, it’s only dirt after all, but I’m hoping they wouldn’t be bothered and find another way to travel.</p>, <p>After some time:</p>, <p>[Digging has reached Level 2].</p>, <p>Ha! Now I can dig faster!</p>, <p>After a few hours of shifting dirt I was able to completely block off one side of the tunnel, leaving only a small gap at the roof. Also, my digging had reached level three.</p>, <p>I’m exhausted, time for a nap!</p>, <p>Covering up the entrance to my now much more spacious hiding hole, I loosen my six legs and place my body down on the soft earth.</p>, <p>I’m so hungry!</p>, <p>My stomach is twisting and cramping. I know this feeling from when my family didn’t send expenses money or neglected to put food in the fridge. I’m no stranger to going hungry.</p>, <p>I just have to wait. When I wake up I’ll go to hunt my first prey.</p>, <p>I already have a target!</p>]\n",

            "[<p>I’m so .... So hungry!</p>, <p>Perched here on the roof of the cavern, my claws dug into the cold rock there is only one thought in my mind.</p>, <p>Food!</p>, <p>All the delicious things I was able to eat in my previous life are spinning through my mind, chocolate, cake, steaks, bread, yes even bread! I haven’t eaten anything for two days now, the hunger is making my mind play tricks on me. The last time I saw a Croca-beast I swore it looked like a cow and nearly leaped at it from the ceiling!</p>, <p>The centipedes are looking and more like a tangle of noodles. I have to solve this situation before I get myself killed chomping on something I shouldn’t.</p>, <p>Two days. I have been planning for two. Whole. Days.</p>, <p>I have studied every aspect of this end of the cavern in excruciating detail. I’ve spent so long hanging upside down over the water basin that I nearly feel asleep and dropped into the water. That would be a swim I wouldn’t enjoy...</p>, <p>A welcome side effect of spending all my time this way has been my sneak has levelled up to four! Thanks to spending my downtime digging away at my hiding place my digging has also reached level three.</p>, <p>Mua HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>, <p>I prepare, I grow, I hunger!</p>, <p>Sigh.</p>, <p>I know, these skills are pretty much useless, ok? I know. I’ll take anything I get at this stage. Hopefully, soon I’ll be able to conquer my first prey.</p>, <p>My antennae twitch suddenly. The target is close, I can smell them. Concentrating hard I try to focus my eyes, I’m currently positioned away from pool in a very dark area of the cavern, the snaking light veins along the walls are far apart here, allowing deep shadows to exist.</p>, <p>My chosen prey has been using the wall on this side of the cavern as a resting place, crawling down to the floor and over to the pool once each day to drink.</p>, <p>An isolated creature, with a predictable movement path that I think I can defeat. So rare! This creature is so damn rare!</p>, <p>Wait, I see it!</p>, <p>Cautiously, the armoured lizard moves down the wall. It nests amongst the rocks towards the top of the wall, I haven’t been able to see clearly enough to identify exactly where so I couldn’t tell when it started moving but I have it now, this is the time to execute my plan.</p>, <p>Moving hurriedly, or as quickly as I can whilst still being stealthy I scramble towards the darkness above the creature. My stomach is rumbling, demanding all the speed I can muster.</p>, <p>Don’t worry stomach! I won’t let you down.</p>, <p>Luckily the armoured lizard moves fairly slowly, especially on the vertical surface, I get into position to strike.</p>, <p>The armour lizard directly below me now, facing away from my position. The large spines protruding from its back look so solid, as if made of stone. Man, I bet it would sting to get stabbed with one of those.</p>, <p>I can’t start thinking negative now, my stomach is counting on me!</p>, <p>Slowly, oh so slowly, I move above the target, my eyes are the eyes of the hunter, the eagle, the tiger! I have to wait for my moment to strike, the timing will be everything.</p>, <p>Now!</p>, <p>Like a flash I flip my body around, take aim and fire my acid spray directly at the target. The liquid falls through the air at tremendous speed, splashing against the rock and covering the Armour Lizards’ feet, a flawless strike.</p>, <p>Ha! My secret target practice over the last few days has paid off!</p>, <p>The creature cries out in pain as the acid begins to burn its legs, it tries to turn and find the attacker but I’m already moving, racing down the wall behind it, all thought of stealth gone.</p>, <p>Now my plan enters the second phase, the Lizard sees me approach and tries to turn and bring its fangs to bear, tilting the fearsome spines forward to cover as much of its body as it can. This is the wrong battle ground for you Lizard! You want to battle me here on the wall? With my incredible grip skill at level three, this wall is no challenge, also, I am nimble and light but you are heavy and slow, with your feet burning with acid how well can you possibly manoeuvre here?</p>, <p>Still you want to face me? Courting death!</p>, <p>Even if I say that, I’m still terrified in this moment. My first battle, the first hunt! I cannot fail here or my life may be over, I have to focus. The Lizard is bracing itself for the close range battle but just before I close in I suddenly turn and blast the Lizard with acid once more.</p>, <p>Ha ha! Didn’t expect that did you!?</p>, <p>Gripping the wall hard I furiously scrabble my six legs to reorient myself for the fight as the Lizard growls and hisses as acid continues to burn at its feet and now face. It won’t be finished from just this however, my acid is still weak, not strong enough to defeat this creature on its own.</p>, <p>As I close in we begin an awkward dance here on the wall, the Lizard trying to thrust forward with its fangs or spines before retreating and me snapping with my mandibles, trying to latch onto a leg or the face.</p>, <p>The sounds of our fight vibrate through the air, bouncing off the rock walls and pillars of stone, shaking the air against my antennae. I’ve seen more than one fight over the last few days settled by new challengers entering as the original combatants grew weary. I can’t allow this to drag out.</p>, <p>As we joust back and forth I can see the Lizard before me is beginning to breathe heavily, the energy required to support its body here on the wall while fighting is taking a toll, its nearly time.</p>, <p>Growing desperate, the Lizard suddenly lunges forward, its spikes rushing directly towards my still pitiful eyes! I have to dodge! A flash of inspiration strikes and I snap my feet further apart, lowering my body closer to the wall. To grip at this sort of angle takes all the strength my tiny claws can muster but it works, the spikes pass just over my head.</p>, <p>Chance!</p>, <p>Before the Lizard can retreat I dart forward, mandibles wide open and snap, crunching them closed on the head of my foe. It releases a pained growl as my jaws continue to squeeze tightly but I harden my heart to its pain.</p>, <p>I’m sorry Lizard, you must become my food!</p>, <p>Now for the final phase. I gather my strength, prepare my heart and then ... leap!</p>, <p>With its head gripped in my mandibles the Lizard begins to fall away from the wall as I sail over its head, scaly feet tipped with claws scrabble and scrape at the stone but burned with acid and worn out from fighting they simply cannot muster the strength to hold the Lizard along with my added weight.</p>, <p>So, we fall.</p>, <p>Crash!</p>, <p>The impact stuns me momentarily and I release the grasp I have on my enemy, however this is also part of my plan. Lying on my back I’m very vulnerable, I must quickly get back on my feet! My six legs begin waving frantically in the air and I resort to rolling back and forth before I am finally able to get my feet under me.</p>, <p>Focusing my eyes I can see my pitiful prey who has fallen into a much more difficult predicament than I did! The long spines and hard shell of the Lizard have plunged directly into the pitfall trap I painstakingly dug after the last visit this Lizard made to the water pool.</p>, <p>Mua hahahahahahahaaa!</p>, <p>Do you see that you stupid Lizard? This is the ingenuity of the human mind combined with my level three digging abilities! I purposefully made the soil loose and soft at the bottom of the trap so the long spines would sink into the earth, trapping the Lizard with its feet in the air unable to escape and indeed, before my blurry eyes my prey is trapped, its feet clawing at the air, trying and failing to roll over.</p>, <p>This is the strategy I obsessed over for two days. Using all my abilities together, shooting acid, fighting on walls, my mandibles, my human intellect and even my digging skill, to be able to triumph over the enemy.</p>, <p>Even so, to cause the Lizard to fall onto its back I was forced into a dangerous manoeuvre. Thankfully the Lizard had such regular habits and travelled on the same path each time, otherwise my trap would have failed.</p>, <p>With the prey incapacitated I start to lose my tension. Using the last of my acid I fire off two more shots, right into the soft belly of the Lizard.</p>, <p>[Acid shot skill has increased to level 2]</p>, <p>So quickly, Gandalf?! Perhaps my skills increase much more rapidly when used in a combat situation as opposed to more casual use, after my stealth skill has taken so much time to level up even when hiding from multiple creatures for hours on end.</p>, <p>Something to ponder after I fill my protesting stomach!</p>, <p>I hoped that using the acid to finish off the Lizard would spare me having to try and bite the creature to death but nature is not that kind, after enduring the cries of the pitiful thing for ten minutes I harden my resolve and use my mandibles to ... uh ... finish the job.</p>, <p>[Bite skill has increased to level 3]</p>, <p>Having to take a life is a bit depressing but getting a skill level feels so rewarding!</p>]\n",

I can easily see that this core is powerful, but I’m not certain that it is powerful enough for my purposes.</p>, <p>Using my antennae, one placed on the large core and the other on one of the smaller ones, I activate the Core Engineering skill and try to combine the two.</p>, <p>Immediately I feel incredibly fierce resistance, pushing back against my mind until a pounding headache erupts between my temples. ARGGHH. These stupid cores... they think they’re all that!!!</p>, <p>COME ON!</p>, <p>Forcing with all my spirit I mentally smash the cores together and hold them tightly, refusing to allow their energies to budge even a millimetre apart.</p>, <p>The larger core exerts far more force than the smaller one, pushing back with an almost irresistible pressure.</p>, <p>But my will is indomitable!</p>, <p>Surrender to me you damned rock!</p>, <p>HRRNKASSAFRAZ.</p>, <p>Eventually the two cores melt together, or more accurately the smaller core is pulled into the larger one and they fuse together.</p>, <p>With the sudden release of pressure I collapse onto the floor of the tunnel. Ugh. This is way too hard.</p>, <p>I don’t allow myself to slump for long. Picking myself up I peer carefully at the massive core, my antennae tapping over it intensely and listening for the voice of Gandalf.</p>, <p>[Compatible core detected, do you wish to reinforce your core or reconstitute the monster?]</p>, <p>As if I would want to reconstitute the mess of a monster this core contains after I smashed another core into it! All I want is to try and manufacture a special core!</p>, <p>Determined, I grasp another small core and begin the process again.</p>, <p>HRRRNNNNNNNNNGAPAAAAA!</p>, <p>Success!</p>, <p>Gasp!</p>, <p>So hard!</p>, <p>[Compatible special core detected ...]</p>, <p>Yes...</p>, <p>YESSSSSSS!</p>, <p>MAUAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!</p>, <p>I gleefully grasp the core in my mandibles and take it towards my trusting, unsuspecting pet Tiny.</p>, <p>[Tiny, use this core as well]</p>, <p>The bat faced Gorilla stares at me for a moment before shaking his head and tapping his chest.</p>, <p>[Full].</p>, <p>[I know buddy, but you can take in one more, just this one].</p>, <p>[Full].</p>, <p>....</p>, <p>BAM!</p>, <p>BAM!</p>, <p>Absorb the special core you disobedient ape! I just spent so much effort making this for you!</p>, <p>BAM!</p>, <p>Thwick!</p>, <p>Eh? What the heck is thwick?!</p>, <p>Retracting my mandibles I pull back from my pet to see what is happening, and my heart lifts when I see the core is stuck to the top of Tiny’s head like a spherical hat and his ape face is scrunched in concentration and pain. I can see the energy within the core leeching out and into the suffering ape. As time passes the core grows smaller and smaller as the suffering on my friends face becomes more intense.</p>, <p>I can totally sympathise with my poor ape buddy. I clearly remember the pain of having that special core push your own capacity beyond the limit. Endure it Tiny! This will unlock a whole new future for you!</p>, <p>As more time passes the expression on Tiny’s face turns from one of suffering into a snarl. His broad shoulders heave and his powerful fingers claw deep trenches into the tunnel floor as he embraces the beast within.</p>, <p>You can do it Tiny! Endure it!</p>, <p>Finally the process is finished and the core has been fully absorbed. The poor guy is still growling, his fists clenching and unclenching.</p>, <p>I tentatively approach him and pat him on the head with my antennae.</p>, <p>I have to admit a strong feeling of guilt is rising in me. I really don’t want to see him in pain, I raised him from when he was just a core after all! I try to firm up my resolve by reminding myself that this is for his own good.</p>, <p>[Evolve Tiny! You need to evolve and get stronger, then you won’t hurt anymore!]</p>, <p>I don’t think he hears me. His beady bat eyes are filled with anger and pain, his mouth is wide open, revealing his fangs but no noise emerges. Tension fills every line of his face.</p>, <p>[Come on Tiny! You’ve got to evolve! It’s the only thing that will help!]</p>, <p>I move closer to my suffering pet to try and soothe him with my presence, stroking his head with my antennae and constantly talking encouragement to him, urging him to begin his evolution. I’m not even 100% certain that Tiny has reached his max level, given the ape’s intelligence, it would be very hard for me to try and extract that information. I could have taken the skill that lets me see his stats but I’m reluctant to part with a skill point just for that. Any reasonably intelligent pet would be able to communicate that to me on their own, surely?</p>, <p>Even if he can’t evolve, I’m living proof that a monster can live with an oversized core for an extended period of time. If he can’t evolve right now then surely it isn’t far away. The main point of my soothing is just to try and help Tiny calm down and adjust to the painful feeling of his new core.</p>, <p>Gradually Tiny is able to relax, his muscles unclenching and uncoiling one by one and his breathing goes from a whistling grunt to slow and even. Slowly but surely he grows more still until his eyes slowly close and he falls back to sleep once more.</p>, <p>Phew.</p>, <p>Poor guy, he really struggled with that process.</p>, <p>I don’t know if he is evolving or just sleeping but I’m glad he’s no longer in pain. Despite feeling terrible about inflicting such harm on my loyal friend I can’t help but be excited for what the future holds for Tiny. I don’t think many monsters are able to push their core beyond the limit and achieve a special evolution in this Dungeon, after all, without a human like intellect how would they be able to recognise the benefits?</p>, <p>Perhaps such monsters, capable of a more intelligent reasoning are common deeper in the Dungeon? The rabid beast like monsters up here are certainly not up to that sort of thinking. If one of them managed to achieve such an evolution it would be by pure accident!</p>, <p>Hang on... What’s that?</p>, <p>Despite having turned my back towards him I can still make out something going on with Tiny, a shift or ripple in my peripheral vision. Snapping back to him my heart leaps with joy!</p>, <p>The apes skin appears to be roiling with energy! It’s an almost ghastly sight as the fur and flesh of my pet appear to balloon and flow like a liquid, or a sheet blowing in the breeze!</p>, <p>I’ve never seen it myself but I think this can only be one thing!</p>, <p>Tiny is evolving!</p>, <p>Before my very eyes the changes continue rapidly. Even as his body continues to shift like clay his fur is growing rapidly, going from short and bristly to silken, stubby growth to long hair in only a few moments. His body continues to change at a rapid speed, in some places sinking and collapsing whilst in others bulging out with rapid expansion!</p>, <p>As the process continues I can see that he definitely growing larger! Quite a bit larger! His hands go from a dark brownish colour to a brilliant blue in what seems like a split second. When I lean closer to inspect the change I’m almost fried by a sudden blast of electricity that explodes from his hands, spreading to cover his whole body!</p>, <p>All over him twisting ropes of electrical current appear and disappear every instant, sizzling with power and rising the temperature of the tunnel to a boiling point!</p>, <p>And still he continues to change!</p>, <p>I wait patiently, watching every shift and detail of the evolution, my heart pounding with excitement.</p>, <p>When the evolution is finally complete I stand silent and awed. Tiny has become twice his previous size, completely dwarfing me and the tunnel in which we sit. His massive form is hunched over, shoulders pressing against the roof.</p>, <p>His fur has grown, hanging down from his long, powerful arms. I can see some of the finer hairs rising from his body, hanging, almost suspended in the air. I suspect the electrical energy in his body is running a current through him constantly, causing some of his fur to rise like this.</p>, <p>Suddenly, he opens his eyes and looks around in confusion.</p>, <p>I hesitantly try to speak to him.</p>, <p>[You ok there Tiny? How do you feel?]</p>, <p>Slowly he swivels his beady eyes over to me and they gradually focus. Then, he grins a wide grin. His bat features split to reveal his glittering mouthful of fangs. Then he thumps himself on the chest with one blue fist.</p>, <p>[Tiny feel strong!]</p>]\n",

            "[<p>He certainly looks damn strong!</p>, <p>The size of the guy!</p>, <p>I think it’s fairly clear to tell that almost all of that evolutionary energy went into Might! Somewhat sadly. I really wish even a sliver of that energy had made it to buffing up his brain power.</p>, <p>Well, it isn’t all bad I suppose. Since Tiny has me to help him do the thinking, and he can now receive my instructions, being as good as he can at fighting is probably for the best, especially when considering the upcoming crises we will soon face.</p>, <p>The final thing I need to do is complete my mutations. With eleven points of Biomass to spend I’ll be able to select a mutation advancement for my legs and then upgrade my Gravitational Energy gland twice.</p>, <p>I open the menu eagerly not even listening to the prompts of Gandalf. Lemme check out dem legs!</p>, <p>Ho boy! Look at all these juicy options!</p>, <p>So many selections that I can choose!</p>, <p>Let’s see now.... Legs that stick to surfaces? Peh I can already do that... Legs with barbed spines emerging from them to stab enemies? Ouch! Legs with extra running speed, frictionless feet for sliding, legs with skin between them to allow for gliding? What the heck?</p>, <p>I’m tempted to take an option that just makes me faster or something plain like that but then my eyes fall on a choice that piques my interest.</p>, <p>[Absorption Legs, connects the core to the feet, allowing the monster to drawn in mana from the surface it is standing on].</p>, <p>So, if I’m running around in the Dungeon, this option will let me draw in mana from the walls and floor?! If the absorption rate is decent then this could provide the missing link to my magic practice! If I can refill my core and the even more mana hungry Gravitational Energy Gland faster they will become much more useful!</p>, <p>I’ll take it!</p>, <p>[Do you wish to select Absorption legs and improve Gravitational Energy Gland to +3? This will cost 11 Biomass]</p>, <p>Hit me!</p>, <p>FLANARGLE!</p>, <p>AHhhhH! The Itch!</p>, <p>Stupid thing!</p>, <p>....</p>, <p>Most of my preparation in this place is done for now. With Tiny’s successful evolution it’s time to re-join the colony and do our part to assist the digging efforts! I ask Tiny to bring along the remain cores and we leave the trap network, heading back to the main shaft before we make our decent to the main nest.</p>, <p>The tunnel walls have grown eerily dim. I haven’t experienced this low a light level ever since I was reborn in this Dungeon. The change in condition is disturbing, making the tunnels feel much more threatening and oppressive. Shadows dance menacingly across the walls as Tiny and I pass through, the patterns of light breaking every time we move.</p>, <p>Tiny is squeezing through the tunnel, hunching his shoulders forward to the point he’s almost kneeing himself in the face as he walks. In one hand he cups the remaining cores protectively against his chest.</p>, <p>We descend down the main shaft in silence. The absent workers and darkness press down on our mentality. The only sounds we hear are the echoes of our movements as we descend.</p>, <p>It seems insane that in a few short hours this empty place will become a monster filled death zone.</p>, <p>I’m almost pathetically grateful when arrive towards the lower end of the shaft and the noises of the colony reach my ears.</p>, <p>Being ants and incapable of any sort of speech, it isn’t chatter that I hear but scritching scrabble of thousands of legs and grinding of dozens of mandibles as the colony hauls dirt, working at a ferocious pace.</p>, <p>Tiny and I finally descend into the Queen’s chamber to discover the room is completely packed with workers, hundreds of them together. Other than a few workers tending to the brood almost all of the ants must be here in this tunnel.</p>, <p>They climb all over each other, some of them heading out and down to the lower tunnel with jaws full of dirt and others running back to collect another haul.</p>, <p>\"Keep working children\", the warm voice of the Queen sings out, gently encouraging the colony.</p>, <p>I honestly don’t think the workers could work any harder! They are practically vibrating with energy, so eager to work at the side of the Queen as she digs.</p>, <p>[Tiny, go down to the lower tunnel and make sure nothing goes wrong] I instruct my ape friend .</p>, <p>He simple nods before lumbering off gently pushing his way through the bustling workers who mostly disregard his presence, some workers even start climbing over him, just walking up his arms and down his back as they move through, still clutching the cores in his hand.</p>, <p>Taking a breath I start to push my way through the worker frenzy, using my larger size to force aside the much smaller hatchlings and workers. So desperate are the others to contribute that I eventually have to resort to quite vigorous methods, knocking other ants out of the way or climbing on top of others in order to get to the front!</p>, <p>It isn’t annoying at all, these are the sorts of people (ants) you want working on your side in a disaster!</p>, <p>When I get to the front of the tunnel I can only be impressed with the progress that has been made. With the Queen working at the front, her enormous mandibles carving up the dirt and rock at a constant rate, combined with a veritable army of assistants carting off the dirt, progress has been rapid indeed.</p>, <p>But it still isn’t enough.</p>, <p>The tunnel has already extended roughly two hundred metres away from the chamber, far from the several kilometres it needs to be! At the moment there probably isn’t even room to put the brood and all the workers inside this tunnel!</p>, <p>And when I consider Tiny....</p>, <p>No way we all fit!</p>, <p>\"Hey there Queen!\" I say to the Queen as I start ripping into the dirt with a frenzy.</p>, <p>It’s convenient to be able to talk without moving your mouth...</p>, <p>\"Welcome child\" she responds, similarly with her mandibles loaded with dirt.</p>, <p>The two of attack the wall, our mandibles tearing away large clumps of earth which we then turn and fling behind us, allowing the smaller workers to do the job of hauling it away.</p>, <p>We aren’t the only ones at the front digging. At any one time there are near to a dozen workers chomping away, extending the tunnel one mandible load at a time. Most of these ants gather up their diggings and cart it away themselves, creating a constant exchange of workers at the front.</p>, <p>The Queen and I remain constant, mandibles pumping like piston engines until my face aches from the sheer repetitive effort of it. Thankfully the feeling of ant zen returns to me once more, the indescribable feeling of doing what it is that you were born to do. My primitive ant senses are flooded with contentment as I dig.</p>, <p>I can’t afford to waste any time though! I shake off the restful zen regretfully. Digging doesn’t require much thought, so I should dedicate this time to practicing my valuable mana skills!</p>, <p>Surrendering my digging to my mechanical instincts I use my will to summon the mana from my core and begin my shaping practice. With the assistance of the sub-brain the mana is drawn out easily, wispy tendrils of strange energy that respond to my thoughts start to flow out and form into mystic patterns within my body.</p>, <p>I still have no idea what these patterns are for or what they represent. They were imprinted in my mind when I learned the skill without any sort of explanation. I’m guessing the only way to actually learn what each is for is by testing, which could be quite dangerous!</p>, <p>I’m resolved to try and begin the experiments away from the colony as soon as my skill reaches an appropriate level. I still find it difficult to form many of the shapes and my success rate, not to mention the speed I can form them, is far too low for practical use.</p>, <p>Practice and then more practice!</p>, <p>Let’s do it!</p>, <p>Just like that, the Queen, me and the entire colony dig for our lives.</p>, <p>As only a colony of ants can, we dig desperately, endlessly, with the single mindedness only an insect can express.</p>, <p>I lose myself to the repetitive motions of my mandibles and the formless mana within me, my body and mind almost completely separate from each other.</p>, <p>After an indeterminate amount of time my awareness snaps back when my core has been emptied, not even faint mist of mana remains.</p>, <p>Quickly checking my stats I can see that my mana shaping has rising by two levels!</p>, <p>Now I just need to wait for my core to refill, hopefully my new legs will be able to assist with that.</p>, <p>The mana veins don’t exist in this particular section of tunnel, since we’ve dug it so recently, so I don’t feel any mana coming to me through my feet for the time being.</p>, <p>We’ve been digging for a while, I’d better go check how dark the nest has become anyway.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Titus was worried.</p>, <p>It was hard to see, the weathered lines of his face were cut deep over years of campaigning, an extra furrow in his brow, a little more tension in his stare, were signs almost impossible to notice.</p>, <p>Tribune Aurillia had noticed. After so many years serving in the Legion she was able to detect the subtle changes in her commander. The tightening of his shoulders, the way he constantly thumbed the blade of his famed axe, testing an edge that he had kept razor sharp for the better part of thirty years.</p>, <p>It wasn’t often Titus was worried.</p>, <p>\"... suspicious activity on the part of the mercenary union and merchants guild, as well as a shift in the rhetoric of the Church of the Path have been reported over the last two weeks. Our strategists suggest that the possibility of a coup in Liria is rising by the day\" Aurillia reported.</p>, <p>...</p>, <p>Titus nodded absently, his iron gaze never leaving the forest expanse that spread out before them from their vantage point on the camp walls. The forest was dark now. Very dark. Even the monsters seemed to sense that something was coming. The din of combat, constant over the last week had faded away to nothing.</p>, <p>There was a tension in the air, as if every living thing in the Dungeon was waiting, ready to spring into violent battle at a moment’s notice.</p>, <p>\"Do you have any instructions to relay to the surface? Commander?\" Aurillia queried.</p>, <p>Her commander didn’t respond, instead continuing to gaze pensively at the expanse, his ice blue eyes reflecting the dying light from the trees.</p>, <p>\"What do you think the Dungeon was like before the Rending, Tribune?\" he asked suddenly.</p>, <p>Aurillia was taken aback by this seemingly unrelated question. After a pausing to consider her response she answered.</p>, <p>\"Nobody knows the condition of the Dungeon before the cataclysm commander. No-one even knew it existed\".</p>, <p>Titus shook his head. \"Of course I know that. I asked what you think it was like, use your imagination Aurillia\".</p>, <p>The Tribune was confused. \"I don’t know commander. We know that the mana level on the surface rose dramatically, I can only imagine that the mana level underground surged to incredible levels.\"</p>, <p>\"I think the Rending was a wave\" mused Titus, \"I think it was just a very large, very long wave\".</p>, <p>This wasn’t an unheard of theory regarding the Rending, but no wave had ever come remotely close to replicating the world shattering effects of the cataclysm that had created this Dungeon age.</p>, <p>\"You’ve read the reports from our neighbouring Legionary outposts?\" Titus asked.</p>, <p>\"I have\" Aurillia nodded.</p>, <p>\"The mana levels have been rising all around us, not just locally. The change has been even, no variation at all. Readings in Banron are the same as ours. I wonder just how far this wave is reaching? It may be covering the entire Perior federation. Perhaps even further?\"</p>, <p>\"Surely you aren’t suggesting this is the beginning of a second cataclysm?\" Aurillia scoffed.</p>, <p>The signs were worrying, but the cataclysm? The civilisations on the surface, humanity included, had almost been wiped out at that time!</p>, <p>A moment of silence descended as Titus stroked his grizzled chin with one hand, contemplating the dim light reflected in his eyes.</p>, <p>\"I don’t know\" he said finally, \"but I’m not sure. Something is different about this one. I just wish I knew what.\"</p>, <p>Another break in the conversation fell as side by side the two veterans spend some time lost in their own thoughts.</p>, <p>Eventually Aurillia felt compelled to speak.</p>, <p>\"Do you have any instructions regarding the situation on the surface commander?\"</p>, <p>Titus slowly nodded.</p>, <p>\"I want every member of the Legion above ground to make immediate preparations to depart for our position within two hours. Not a single trainee or auxiliary is to remain behind. I don’t care if they have to burn the Loremasters library to the ground, Alberton needs to be down here also\".</p>, <p>\"Everyone?\" gasped Aurillia, \"you’re going to abandon the Queen? Do you think there won’t be an insurrection?\"</p>, <p>\"There will be a coup and the Queen will be killed\" Titus said.</p>, <p>\"Then why?\"</p>, <p>\"The politics of surface kingdoms is of no interest to me, nor should it be to you Tribune. Our duty and our focus lies in the Dungeon\" Titus replied firmly.</p>, <p>\"But the Queen has been a loyal supporter of ours for decades. You’re talking about Alberton’s aunt!\" Aurillia protested. She couldn’t believe that Titus would be so cold hearted.</p>, <p>Titus paused for a moment, his jaw visibly clenching and a spark of anger igniting in his eyes.</p>, <p>\"Listen to me Tribune\" he said tightly, \"we stand on the verge of an unprecedented disaster. The only thing standing between the city of Liria and a flood of monsters are these fortifications\" he emphasised his words by slamming his fist down on the compacted earthen walls, \"and the Legionaries who followed our orders to come here. The Queen has left herself vulnerable and I can’t do a damned thing about that. I will protect my people no matter the cost\".</p>, <p>Faced with the slowly burning rage in Titus’ ice blue eyes Aurillia could only swallow her protests.</p>, <p>\"It will be done commander\" she assented.</p>, <p>Titus simple nodded and turned away from the wall to face the camp itself. Temporary buildings erected by Earth Mages were constructed in neat rows, dotted here and there with canvas tents and open built forges.</p>, <p>The men and women of the Legion who had joined him on this expedition were all present here in this camp, nobody had been allowed to venture out a centimetre since the light had begun to fade.</p>, <p>\"I want you to send a message to Rixard\" Titus suddenly said.</p>, <p>Aurillia was taken aback. \"My son? Why?\" she asked.</p>, <p>Titus dropped his chin to his chest for a moment before looking back up and continuing to speak. \"I want him to pass a message onto the Mercs and Merchants\".</p>, <p>Aurillia felt her heart grow still. \"I’m not sure why you couldn’t just send a message directly commander. My son is only a low level merchant in the city, they won’t hold the message in any higher regard for being delivered by him\".</p>, <p>Titus chuckled and shook his head. \"Aurillia\" a note of warning entered his tone, \"don’t play games. Not to me\".</p>, <p>It was the Tribunes turn to drop her head as her commander continued. \"I know Rixard has been passing information of our movements to the Mercenaries. Information he has been stealing from you. They will listen to him. Letting them know we were aware of their little mole will send another message also.\"</p>, <p>\"How long did you know?\" Aurillia whispered.</p>, <p>Titus snorted. \"You didn’t try to hide it Tribune, you wanted us to know. We found out years ago\".</p>, <p>Aurillia gathered herself and saluted her commander. \"I’m ready to accept my punishment commander\".</p>, <p>Titus looked her in the eye for a moment. Her gaze never wavered. She had been prepared for this moment for a long time he supposed. To her astonishment he simply waved her away. \"I’m the last person who will judge another for a wayward child Aurillia, the fault is not yours. Get Rixard to tell them we will hold here for two weeks. Two weeks only. After that they will be on their own\".</p>, <p>\"Where will we go commander?\" the relieved officer asked.</p>, <p>\"Down\".</p>, <p>Clapping Aurillia on the back, Titus moved away from the wall and began to walk through the camp, having a quiet word with his soldiers as he passed by, a joke here and there, a bit of encouragement, the occasional stern word.</p>, <p>Wherever we went he was met with respect, determination and idolisation shining in the eyes of his Legionaries. He knew it was there, knew what they thought of him. As much as it was embarrassing he welcomed their hero worship so long as it led them to do what he asked. He could keep them alive that way.</p>, <p>He didn’t feel much like a hero. His back hurt, his knuckles ached and the cartilage in his left elbow made a grinding sound every time he hefted his axe. It wouldn’t be long now before the Legion retired him to the stone.</p>]\n",

I slowly push my way out, letting my smaller siblings climb over the top of me in their eagerness to rush forward. At this point the walls and ceiling are also covered in workers assisting the dig. Truly a three dimensional work effort!</p>, <p>Eventually I make it through the worst of the crowd and begin to make better progress. I was probably only digging for a couple of hours but the tunnel has become much longer, perhaps doubling in size!</p>, <p>This is the power of the excavation skill! Not to mention being significantly larger and stronger than the rest of the workers….</p>, <p>Anyway! Progress has been made.</p>, <p>When I arrive in the Queens former chamber I'm shocked by what I see. Or rather, what I don't see</p>, <p>It's completely dark! I can barely see a thing!</p>, <p>The illumination caused by the mana veins in the walls has completely vanished, plunging this chamber, the entire nest and I can only assume the whole Dungeon into pitch black darkness.</p>, <p>It's a bit spooky.</p>, <p>Placing my fancy new feet here and there on the Dungeon walls I try to see if there is any mana for me to soak up and unfortunately I'm coming up completely empty! The mana veins are bone dry.</p>, <p>Thinking back to what Formo told me, that must mean the mana has completed receded. After which it would…. Come rushing back… like… a tidal wave…</p>, <p>….</p>, <p>Uhhhhh….</p>, <p>[Tiny? Can I get you to come back up here to the chamber?]</p>, <p>I can feel the ape's agreement in my mind without him having to actually form words.</p>, <p>Whilst I wait I continue to shift my feet about, doing an awkward ant dance as I try to sense the presence of mana returning.</p>, <p>Nothing at the moment.</p>, <p>Hang on, where is the brood? The larvae and pupae? I don't think we've secured the next generation!</p>, <p>Feeling about desperately with my antennae I make my way towards the heat signature given off by the newly dug brood chamber above Queen's room.</p>, <p>Dammit! The entire brood is still here in this room!</p>, <p>Inside the chamber no more than five workers are tending to the next generation of ants, shifting them about, cleaning them and ensuring they have food.</p>, <p>We have to get these guys out of here!</p>, <p>Rushing forward in a panic I can't think of anything better than to shout \"we have to move them, it's dangerous here!\" and grab the closest larvae in my mandibles.</p>, <p>The attendant workers seem stunned by sudden intrusion, antennae swirling in the dark as they 'listen' to my message. Remarkably, after a brief pause they too pick up a larvae and start running after me.</p>, <p>Thank Gandalf!</p>, <p>With a small wiggling grub in my mandibles I rush back into the Queen's chamber where Tiny has arrived, the enormous ape humming to himself contentedly as he rests on his backside.</p>, <p>[Stay here Tiny! There will be a fight soon!]</p>, <p>[Fight!]</p>, <p>Tiny visibly perks up at the prospect of combat. Small sparks of electricity start twisting and sizzling in the air around him as he stands up and looks around for something to punch.</p>, <p>[Soon I said!]</p>, <p>I roar at him as my small convoy of workers rushes into the tunnel after me. About one hundred metres in, before the crowd becomes too large I carefully place the young larva down and shout \"the brood has to be moved to here!\" as loudly as I can.</p>, <p>Having delivered this stirring speech I turn and run back to brood chamber!</p>, <p>The brood is the next generation of workers! There are almost five hundred of the little buggers! If they can survive to maturity then the colony will nearly double in size! I can't let them die pointlessly when the wave starts!</p>, <p>Rushing into the chamber I grab the first larva I can see. The small white grub wiggles in protest at being manhandled in this way but I don't have the time to be too gentle! Deal with it grub! I'm saving your life!</p>, <p>As I sprint back out of the chamber I'm relieved to see a flood of workers running in, roused by my crude summons. There are two things that ants will protect at any cost, the Queen and the brood! Both represent the future hope the family, nothing must be allowed to happen to them!</p>, <p>When I return to the Queen's chamber my heart sinks as I realise I've felt something.</p>, <p>Something from my feet.</p>, <p>It is faint. It is so faint, but I'm certain of it. From the tips of my little ant claws the faintest sign, almost undetectable, a soft breath of mana is being absorbed.</p>, <p>Oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no!</p>, <p>It's coming!</p>, <p>We don't have long!</p>, <p>Hustle Anthony! Get your damn hustle on!</p>, <p>With renewed vigour I sprint to deliver my wriggly charge into the tunnel as fast as I possibly can, legs flailing with incredible speed.</p>, <p>\"Let's go people! Danger coming! GOGOGOGO\" I shout at the top of my pheromones.</p>, <p>[Tiny, it's coming!]</p>, <p>Receiving my warning, Tiny positively bounces on his feet, arms swinging with anticipation. I mentally sigh. The eager gleam in his eyes at the promise of battle surely hasn't changed about him from after his evolution.</p>, <p>As I sprint back and forth, aided by dozens of others the workers the panic in my heart grows with every step of my feet. My legs begin to thrum with energy as the light returns to the walls of the tunnel. The near complete darkness is gradually chased away as the veins that curl through the walls begin to glow, pulsing rapidly with mana.</p>, <p>I'm nervous Gandalf…. I'm really worried!</p>, <p>Fear pierces to the depths of my very soul when I think about what would have happened if I hadn't spoken to Formo. I'd be staring at the walls thinking how nice it was the light was coming back!</p>, <p>Even having spoken to him, I don't really know exactly what this wave will look like, which only adds to my anxiety!</p>, <p>My fellow workers and I continue to race back and forth, carting our protesting and uncomfortable young from their cozy brood chamber to the dirty and crowded tunnel.</p>, <p>Stop squirming you little ingrate!</p>, <p>On my fifth trip the light has risen back to the level it was before it began to fade, but still it continues to rise!</p>, <p>Then I notice something else.</p>, <p>I'm puzzled at first but eventually I figure it out and that realisation causes me to nearly trip and send my present charge flying from my grip.</p>, <p>There are heat sources coming from the walls.</p>, <p>All over the place. I can barely sense them but I'm sure of it. As the mana is coming back small spots in the walls have started registering to my antennae, with every second the passes they grow larger and larger.</p>, <p>Ohhhhh boy.</p>, <p>This isn't just one or two, there are dozens of them! My antennae start to spin wildly when I realise that I'm getting more readings from further away in the nest.</p>, <p>[Here we go Tiny! It's about to get hot in here!]</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Mirryn awoke with a start.</p>, <p>Instantly wide eyed and alert she turned her head to look around her and her eyes were struck immediately by the austere white room in which she lay. She was lying on a clean bed in a small white chamber. On the roof a glowing crystal provided illumination, a clean white light the filled the space warmly. Just looking at that light nearly brought Mirryn to tears. She'd feared that she would die surrounded by the blue light of the Dungeon, seeping into her body and killing her slowly.</p>, <p>She couldn't remember much of her arrival to the Legion base in the Dungeon. After their long descent down the carved spiral staircase that the commander had referred to as Periclasus' stair. That journey had tested the trainees to their limits. It had taken long days of endless marching to reach the bottom, spiralling ever downwards into the depths and the lower they got, the sicker they become.</p>, <p>None of the trainees had been down in the Dungeon this deep, for this long. Without proper acclimation, the lower part of the first strata would normally be the first place that a Dungeon delver would need to worry about saturation sickness, or 'the blues' as it was colloquially known.</p>, <p>During this wave, which didn't seem to want to end, the mana had risen to ridiculous levels, the first strata was currently reading much the same as the second right now, the trainees were unable to cope. Every one of them was struck with the blues, quite literally turning a light shade of blue as the raw mana of the Dungeon began to pervade their bodies. Mana saturation sickness was an insidious killer and a truly messy death. Delvers, mercs and every being who entered the Dungeon lived in fear of it, their bodies literally breaking apart cell by cell as the excess energy ravaged their bodies.</p>, <p>The trainees got their taste of it as they walked the endless stairs. They began to stumble, their legs no longer responding as they should. The further they got the more the symptoms became pronounced. Their vision slowly overtaken by a blue haze that made it difficult to see, their hands started shaking, then the whole body. The young, strong trainees began to experience the fear that was normally reserved for the aged, the fear of having their own body betray them and begin to fall out of their control.</p>, <p>Through it all they felt no pain, only a giddy, inexhaustible nervous energy. The blues didn't make people feel tired, as the name might suggest, rather the mana suffusing their body and brain numbed them and gave them the jitters, as if they'd been drinking five cups of coffee every hour. They couldn't sleep, couldn't rest, couldn't think clearly, they were both more exhausted than they'd ever been in their lives and completely unable to rest.</p>, <p>With the encouragement and support of their fellow Legionaries and officers they'd barely made it, the only other members of the party struggling as much as them was the prisoners the Legion had mysteriously brought with them on this expedition.</p>, <p>Less capable than the trainees many of them had to be carried towards the end, the soldiers taking turns to hoist the murderers on their backs as they battled the long march.</p>, <p>The last Mirryn could remember was arriving before a large stone door. She could barely see by that point, the door itself was nothing but a blur. The commander had stepped forward and done… something and the door had swung open, vague figures had rushed out, gathering the sick members of the party and bringing them inside. She had collapsed into the arms of the person rushing towards her and then woken up here.</p>, <p>Looking around the room some more she noticed a strange arrangement on the side of the bed. A tube had been inserted in her arm, surrounded by a glowing enchantment that had been drawn directly onto her skin. Nervously following the tube with her eyes she saw it was attached to another enchantment drawn on a nearby flat table. The center of the table held four softly glowing cores.</p>, <p>Mirryn stared at the strange setup, puzzled, after closing her eyes to try and feel if anything was different she noticed that her saturation sickness was significantly better. If she focused hard she was able to feel the flow of mana in her body, slowly inching down her arm being before being leeched out through the tubes and being fed to the cores on the table.</p>, <p>She was stunned, she'd never even heard of this kind of treatment before. Such fine manipulation of the mana in another person's body via an enchantment… How had they done it?</p>, <p>\"I haven't heard anything Alberton but as soon as I do, you'll be the first to know!\" the commanders voice penetrated through the door.</p>, <p>Soon after the tread of heavy feet could be heard as the Loremaster and commander continued to argue with each other.</p>, <p>\"I just can't understand why we didn't make more of an effort to prevent Garralosh from reaching the surface. You know what will happen up there. That's my family dammit!\"</p>, <p>There was a heavy thump, as if a fist had smacked into a wall.</p>, <p>\"You think you're the only person with family up there Alberton? You think I don't want rip the head off that Croc and protect our people? Is that what you think?\" the commander demanded quietly.</p>, <p>There a was a long pause and Mirryn began to wonder what was going on when she barely heard the Loremaster sigh and reply.</p>, <p>\"I'm just worried\".</p>, <p>\"We all are, but we have a duty to get here to HQ and support the bulwark. As much damage as Garralosh can do, would you want the second strata monsters to rise to the surface? Do you know what that would mean? This wave isn't ordinary Alberton and you would should stop pretending that it is. The entire world could go up flames if we aren't careful\".</p>, <p>Another sigh and a quiet \"I know\" before the door suddenly opened and the two top officers of the Liria branch Legionem Abyssi strode into the room.</p>, <p>\"Ah, good to see you're finally awake trainee\" Titus nodded.</p>, <p>Mirryn nodded in return but felt a little confused, this greeting didn't feel as positive as it should. Something about her commanders tone and posture was off, even Alberton looked somewhat downcast, almost not meeting her eye.</p>, <p>\"Is this the HQ?\" she asked.</p>, <p>\"Yes\" Titus affirmed, \"you're in the medical wing. The mana saturation was much higher than expected on this journey, we had to perform emergency treatment to lower the mana levels in your body. All of the trainees received the same treatment, you're the last to wake\".</p>, <p>Mirryn's head spun for a moment. So all of them had been in this place? Where were they now?</p>, <p>Alberton could see the question in her expressions. \"The others are waiting for you. We have to move quickly\" he said.</p>, <p>\"Can you walk trainee?\" Titus asked.</p>, <p>Mirryn tested her legs. \"I think so, sir\".</p>, <p>She rolled out of her bed and stood shakily on her feet. She was still weak from the blues. Titus didn't wait for her to ask and stepped forward to support her, carefully removing the pipe from her arm as he did so.</p>, <p>In silence the two old officers walked with her out of the room and down a long corridor. The place was strangely empty and quiet, Mirryn didn't see or hear another person as they travelled. They came to a heavy wooden door with a carved, enchanted lock on the door. Titus waved his palm in front of the elaborate carving and it immediately glowed with bright light before the door swung open to reveal a winding staircase carved in rock.</p>, <p>Not another one, Mirryn thought.</p>, <p>Not saying anything the three descended, Titus keeping a steady grip on her shoulder to help her navigate the steps without falling. At the bottom of the stairs was a small chamber with another door in it and gathered there were all of the trainees.</p>, <p>Mirryn felt relief when she finally saw other people. The feeling quickly faded when she realised that the air was tense in the room, the trainees were nervous, the officers solemn.</p>, <p>With the trainees tightly packed together in the small space, Titus took a position on the lower steps, placing him higher than his audience so they could see him and began to speak.</p>, <p>\"Congratulations trainees. You have successfully braved the dangers and hardships of this delve and made it here to the headquarters of the Liria branch of the Abyssal Legion. I'm proud of you\".</p>, <p>And he really was. Looking down on these young Legionaries filled him with pride. They were good people, strong people. They had sacrificed, fought, upheld the tenants of the Legion and proven their mettle. They gave him hope for the future.</p>, <p>The trainees themselves allowed themselves a small smile at the rare words of praise from the commander, but the serious expression on his face dampened the mood quickly.</p>, <p>\"You represent half of the trainees inducted in your year. The others have been weeded out. Not dedicated enough. Not loyal enough. Not willing to sacrifice. Only those that we trust to keep the secrets of the Legion and do their duty make it this far. You have earned the right to become full Legionaries\".</p>, <p>Excitement, smiles and joy lit the expressions of the trainees. This was what they had been hoping for ever since they enrolled. They had worked so hard for this!</p>, <p>Titus saw the looks on their faces and it acknowledged it with a nod even as his heart sank in his chest. This was always the hardest part…..</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Titus was a renowned Legionary above and below the ground. He was known for his strength, his iron will, his leadership and his willingness to put himself in harms' way to protect his fellows, he was a leader who never spared himself.</p>, <p>Most of all, he was known for his unyielding sense of duty. He had sacrificed over and over again in order to perform the role he filled and he would damn well do it again. He never hesitated, did not regret but often, he grieved.</p>, <p>Looking down at the eager trainees below him he felt sorrow grip his heart.</p>, <p>But it didn't stop him.</p>, <p>\"You are about to undergo the final trial on the path to becoming full members of the Deep Legion\" he announced.</p>, <p>Serious expressions overtook the trainees at the word trial. What would they need to do?</p>, <p>\"You have experienced severe mana saturation sickness on the way here and we have done what we can alleviate the symptoms, but we have not cured you. Behind that door lies the greatest secret of the Legion. We will cure you of saturation sickness permanently, the process will also make you stronger, faster, smarter, more powerful than you currently are. When it is done you will be reborn\".</p>, <p>A few gasps and disbelieving murmurs erupted from the youths in front of him. Was any of this even possible?</p>, <p>Titus pointed to the door behind them. \"Beyond there lies the greatest secret of the Legion. It enabled the first Legionaries to perform the heroic feats deep in the Dungeon that helped end the Cataclysm thousands of years ago and it fuels us today. Every full Legionary you have ever met has undergone this process, including me\".</p>, <p>The commander took a deep breath. No avoiding it.</p>, <p>\"Let's go in and I'll explain further\".</p>, <p>Titus gestured to Alberton who squeezed through the cramped chamber before unlocking the enchanted seal on the door and striding through. Titus waited on the stairs until everyone had entered the next room before stepping forward, closing the door behind him as he did so.</p>, <p>Of all the trainees Mirryn was the only one to note his actions closely and a sudden fear gripped her heart. The way they moved, it was almost as if they had been blocking the exit, making sure that it was impossible for someone to get past them…</p>, <p>Suddenly anxious, she cast her eyes around the room they now found themselves in. The room itself was unremarkable. Light was provided by glowstones embedded in the ceiling which illuminated a simple and unadorned stone chamber. The chamber itself was long, but narrow, with regular offcuts down the right side. Pushing past her fellow trainees, Mirryn saw that in each offcut a narrow basic had been chiselled into the floor, almost like a bath carved into the stone. Counting quickly under her breath she saw that there was thirty such 'pods', each with the same narrow basin that appeared designed to have a person lie down in it.</p>, <p>Closely inspecting the pod she realised the ceiling directly above each basin was not as simple as she had first assumed. Incredibly fine, intricate runic patters had been carved into the surface, the lines so thin she almost hadn't seen them. In the center of the pattern a thin hole could be seen, perhaps for something to flow through and fill the basin? Even the basin itself was covered in intricate runic inscriptions. Just what were these for?</p>, <p>Her anxious musing was interrupted by a sudden clap from the commander. All of the trainees stopped gazing around and turned back to their officer, paying close attention.</p>, <p>\"I will know explain the process to you\" the commander said crisply, his eyes hard with determination, \"listen closely as this will impact the rest of your life\".</p>, <p>He paused there to ensure he had their full attention.</p>, <p>\"Each of you will strip down and lie in a separate pod. From the ceiling above we will release pure, condensed liquid mana that will fill the basin until you are submerged. The fluid will be absorbed into your body, remaking it into something new. After twenty four hours it'll be done and you'll be a full legionary\".</p>, <p>The trainees were staring at him as if he were insane. Liquid mana?! What the hell was that?! Donnelan stood with the rest, his mind flicking at lightning speed. If mana could be condensed into a liquid, wouldn't it be much more potent that the energy in the Dungeon? Wouldn't they just die?!</p>, <p>Titus could see their confusion. He did not move to reassure them.</p>, <p>\"This process is exceedingly dangerous. It will be the most painful experience of your lives. Every cell in your body will become super saturated with mana, tearing at the seams. There are powerful healing enchantments built into the basin. You will be ripped apart and remade constantly for a day. One in five of you will not survive\".</p>, <p>The deep, stern voice of Titus faded away and there was total silence as the trainees stared back at their commander in shock. They had been prepared for many things, but not this!</p>, <p>Alberton spoke from behind them, his voice weary with sorrow. \"To defeat the monsters, to protect the civilisations on the surface the Legionem Abyssi decided that to be human was not enough. In order to overcome the Cataclysm, to make sure that it would never happen again, this was the step they decided to take\".</p>, <p>His words fell on the young trainees like stones. This was real. It was going to happen. Fear gripped their hearts as they imagined the agony of having their very cells ripped apart for hours on end. Could they endure it?</p>, <p>Several thought fleetingly of running, of escaping this chamber and the insane ritual about to take place but they quickly squashed the thought. Who was that standing in the doorway, they thought bitterly. Commander Titus. He was a legend in the Legion. If all of them unleashed their most powerful skills at once would they shave even one HP from him?</p>, <p>\"Nobody is forced to take the ritual\" Titus announced grimly, bringing relief to the trainees. Before they could start to celebrate he pulled the short sword on his hip from its sheath and gripped it tightly in his right hand.</p>, <p>\"But you cannot know the Legions secrets and not be one of us. If you wish to spare yourself the suffering, step forward and I will give you a quick end\" he said.</p>, <p>Alberton found Titus staring at the wall outside the ritual chamber, as he always did once the trainees had begun their transformation. Once the process was done they would be remade into an entirely new species, no longer human, but Legion.</p>, <p>They could delve further into the Dungeon than anyone else could hope to, able to tolerate levels of mana saturation beyond what a normal person could ever dream. They would be able to take the fight directly to the monsters, able to chase them down wherever they chose to hide. That was what it meant to join the Abyssal Legion.</p>, <p>This had been done for thousands of years, all over Pangera. The secrets of the first Legionaries had been kept ever since those days. As Loremaster it was Alberton's role to keep the histories of those days and the determination, the sheer will of those men and women had remained within their spirit to this day.</p>, <p>That didn't mean they liked it.</p>, <p>The screams echoed through the chamber now. Down the corridors and up the stairs. On and on, endlessly screaming. Alberton could well remember what it had been like, he still experienced it in his nightmares, his throat ripping apart from the force of his shrieks only to be healed instantly, allowing him to scream some more.</p>, <p>Amidst the howls of agony a tap, tap, tap of chisel on stone could faintly be heard as Alberton approached his friend.</p>, <p>As he drew closer the memorial wall became clear, thousands of names had been written here by Legion commanders through the centuries since this base had been established. Titus knelt on the ground, his hands steady as he added one more name to the bottom of the list.</p>, <p>Alberton felt his heart twist with pain. The Legion did everything they possibly could to test their new trainees before they reached this point. Anyone they didn't think would be willing to undergo the Baptism had been separated, recommended to other forces, placed in the Auxiliary or other surface teams that were not required to delve. Even though the trainees didn't know it, they had been forensically examined for years before they reached this point.</p>, <p>The Legion didn't want to have the blood of their own people on their hands. Unfortunately no system was perfect.</p>, <p>Trelik had been unwilling to undergo the baptism, he had accepted Titus' offer.</p>, <p>Now the commander knelt and added his name to the wall, along with every other trainee who had not survived the final trial. Tomorrow, the baptism would be over and Titus would have to kneel here again.</p>, <p>It was impossible to converse with the horrific cries of their own people ringing in their ears. Instead Alberton walked beside his friend and placed a hand on his shoulder as he let his eyes roam over the names on the wall.</p>, <p>The Legion was the frontline against the Dungeon, none fought harder or delved deeper than they. To achieve this they had been called on to relentlessly sacrifice. None more so than Titus.</p>, <p>Alberton let his gaze rest on one name in particular. Romanus.</p>, <p>How must it have felt, he sighed, when the commander had carved his only sons name into this wall?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Her hands hurt like hell.</p>, <p>Mirryn leaned against the parapet of the Legion HQ and took in the view, resting her forearms on the stone.</p>, <p>\"How are you holding up?\" a voice came nearby.</p>, <p>Mirryn turned to see Donnelan approaching from along the wall.</p>, <p>\"Couldn't sleep either, huh?\" she asked him.</p>, <p>\"Not a chance in hell\" he muttered.</p>, <p>Neither of them wanted to talk about their baptism but they couldn't help thinking about it. When they had finally been taken out of the basin the trainees had immediately lost consciousness, their minds longer supported by the complex enchantments that had surrounded them.</p>, <p>Upon awakening they learned that three of their friends had died.</p>, <p>All things considered it wasn't a bad number. Below average. She could see the relief in the officers faces that they hadn't lost more. It seemed stupid, to be thankful of only three deaths but she understood their logic. Would the situation be somehow better if four had died?</p>, <p>No.</p>, <p>The commander and the rest of the Legionaries had been past to visit them in the days since. The trainees had been placed in a convalescence unit, comfy beds, good food, medical staff around the clock, counselling specialists, the works.</p>, <p>On the surface Mirryn would have been shocked to think of the cost of the lavish treatment, the Legion was legendarily thrifty, they made most of their own equipment, ate nutritious but brutally unflavoured food. It was a regular sight for the trainees to be seen cleaning their leathers and polishing their swords outside the barracks in the dawn light right next to their officers.</p>, <p>The trainees were learning just how many things they had thought they'd known had been an elaborate deception. The Abyssal Legion they thought they'd known, the Dungeon they'd thought they'd known, indeed, the world they thought they had lived in were so far from the truth.</p>, <p>\"Did you ever think that something like this could exist?\" Mirryn asked Donnelan as he joined her.</p>, <p>\"Absolutely not\" he answered flatly, \"In fact I specifically remember being told such a thing was impossible\".</p>, <p>Even though she was looking at it, Mirryn still thought it was impossible.</p>, <p>It was a city.</p>, <p>In the Dungeon.</p>, <p>A vast egg shaped cavern of impossible size, kilometres across and many more high, filled with people. The buildings covered the bottom of the cavern and then extended up the walls, carved into the rock face. A gigantic glowstone at the top of the space provided illumination in the day and faded at night, regulating the time for the thousands of citizens here in Railleh.</p>, <p>Through some mechanism she couldn't imagine the cavernous space managed to keep the Dungeon veins out. There was no risk of monsters spawning within the city itself. Such safety within the Dungeon felt weird to her. She'd spent every moment underground up to this point being completely alert. To be this relaxed down here felt, unnatural.</p>, <p>From her vantage point Mirryn could see the city bustling with activity day and night, the people moving like ants in the cramped streets below. Even now the light of thousands of lamps lit the city at night like a sea of candles in the darkness. It was incredible.</p>, <p>The Legion headquarters was about halfway up, a citadel that occupied a position of great standing, looking down over the rest of the city. She hadn't been able to explore much yet, the trainees were basically confined to recovery. Not the trainees actually… Full Legionaries now.</p>, <p>Mirryn had longed for that for so long…</p>, <p>\"How's your hand?\" Donnelan asked.</p>, <p>She glanced down at the heavy bandages that wrapped her forearms all the way to the tip of her fingers.</p>, <p>\"Better\" she said, \"they've been healed but they're worried about damage to the bone so I'll be under wraps for a few days yet\".</p>, <p>Donnelan's expression twisted a little. Unable to contain his curiosity he eventually asked \"Is it true how they got injured?\"</p>, <p>\"What did you hear?\" she answered.</p>, <p>\"That you punched the commander in the face\".</p>, <p>Mirryn shrugged her shoulders uncomfortably. \"it's true\".</p>, <p>Donnelan whistled his appreciation. \"I can't… I cannot even imagine it. Did he say anything?\"</p>, <p>He hadn't. The commander had visited each trainee personally upon their wakening. When she'd finally opened her eyes and got her bearings he'd already been there. He didn't explain, or justify. He just sat there. On seeing the man that she'd trusted so much, almost like a father, who had done such an unspeakable thing to her and her friends … she'd lost it. Rage and fury had exploded in her.</p>, <p>She'd been able to contain it at first… what would be the point of hitting him?</p>, <p>When she asked how many had died and he told her she'd leapt out of the bed and punched him right in the face with both hands. He hadn't resisted in anyway, willingly accepting her strikes, but, the end result was she broke both fists. She didn't think the commander had even moved.</p>, <p>She'd spoken with some of her fellow trainees, especially Donnelan. There were feelings of anger, of betrayal and of fear. Fear of the pain that kept them awake at night, fear of the never ending horror of it and deep down, fear that the Legion was right.</p>, <p>They could feel now. Ever since they'd awoken they could tell that something was different. Their bodies were absorbing mana out of the air, breathing it in and out through their pores. Mirryn felt stronger, healthier, her mind felt like it moved more quickly, with greater agility.</p>, <p>They hadn't even begun training or using their new bodies yet but they could already tell that they had been fundamentally changed. She didn't think it would end with just this either, she thought there would be more secrets to come.</p>, <p>She knew that her officers were good people. The impression she had of them from years of living alongside them weren't wrong. They were indeed the kind of hard line, duty bound hard heads that would put people they cared about through such torment, so long as they had good reason to.</p>, <p>The torment was over but Mirryn was afraid to find out why it was necessary.</p>, <p>The Legion had done this for thousands of years, why? What exactly are they fighting down here?</p>, <p>She turned back to Donnelan. \"When do you think they'll let us out and into the city?\" she asked.</p>, <p>He smiled. \"Hopefully soon. After everything that's happened I could do with some leave. A few refreshments wouldn't go astray\".</p>, <p>Mirryn shook her head. \"A whole new world to explore down here and the only thing you care about is getting drunk?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes\" he said.</p>, <p>After a pause they both laughed and turned back to the city spread below them. Growing up in an undeveloped frontier country like Liria had stunted them in many ways. They'd very rarely met members of the other races, didn't come into contact with the rare and powerful artefacts of the old empires. The frontier nations had been established in land that nobody had wanted by people with the grit to try and carve out a new life for themselves. The kingdoms, empires and alliances that had endured from the Cataclysm to today were far off legends to them. Here and now, looking down on the impossible city below them they felt as if those fairy tales they had heard were so close they could reach out and touch them.</p>, <p>A cough sounded behind them and the two jumped, turning quickly to find Tribune Aurillia behind them.</p>, <p>\"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Legionaries?\" the older woman enquired.</p>, <p>The two stiffened at being approached by their officer. It would take a long time for any sort of trust to exist between them again. Aurillia was not offended, or even surprised. She naturally knew how they felt, she'd gone through the same thing herself.</p>, <p>\"The commander has called for you to assemble. It's time to find out if what you endured was worth it\".</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The rest of the new Legionaries were gathered together in a cluster at the end of their ward under the watchful eye of a few Centurions.</p>, <p>The young soldiers felt restless. They still didn't know how to feel towards the Legion and the seniors who had cared for and trained them for so long. The pain of the Baptism was still fresh in their minds, the scars still raw. Many of them felt a strange dual emotion towards the people they had once admired, equal parts anger and respect.</p>, <p>Aurillia stepped forward to address them.</p>, <p>\"Thank you for gathering young Legionaries. You have endured the pain of the Baptism and suffered the loss of friends, as have we all\" she looked each of them in the eye directly, letting them see that she knew of their pain, shared it.</p>, <p>\"I'm sure you've felt it already, the changes in your body. You are no longer what you were before. Your very flesh has been infused with mana and this means a few things will change. Firstly, you can never live on the surface without regular doses of liquid mana to support your body. The mana there is too thin. Here inside the Dungeon you'll be fine but in the upper levels you'll begin to feel a bit weak\".</p>, <p>Murmurs erupted from the new Legionaries at these words. Unable to live on the surface without liquid mana? If the Legion were the only ones who knew how to make it, isn't this just another way for them to be controlled?</p>, <p>\"It also means\" Aurrilia interrupted their thoughts, \"that so long as you are able to absorb enough mana you will be able to do things that you had never imagined possible before\".</p>, <p>Now she glared at them. Impressing her will on them. All of them wilted before the strength she held in her gaze.</p>, <p>\"I know that you are questioning the Legion, I did once also. When you have experienced the fight we are engaged in for yourself you will no longer hold any such childish notions! If you truly want to protect you loved ones from the horrors of the Dungeon, then you've come to the right place. The Abyssal Legion stands on the frontline against the true threats and for thousands of years we have done battle far beneath the surface, an unending war that few people in Liria have ever heard of\".</p>, <p>She glared at them once more.</p>, <p>\"Come\".</p>, <p>So saying, she turned and pushed open the heavy wooden doors that separated their ward from the rest of the Legionary building before marching briskly through. The former trainees followed closely behind, trying to not stare at the bustle around them. Legionaries in their customary blackened leather armour stood in guard positions down every down corridor or passage they moved through, auxiliaries dashed about, delivering papers, meals, equipment or any of the million other tasks that the Legion needed done in order to operate. The new Legionaries were hardly spared a glance as they followed behind Aurillia, escorted by the Centurions who followed them.</p>, <p>The castle was carved directly into the wall of the space in which Railleh was situated. As with all things the Legion constructed it was built on very clean lines, straight corridors and square rooms, giving the entire structure a very austere feeling. It was easy to tell that the structure was old. Possibly too old.</p>, <p>Mirryn looked around and made a few estimations in her head before she came to the shocking realisation than this base, indeed, the city of Railleh itself, probably predated Liria by a considerable amount of time. The Legion had been here long before the nation of her birth had even been created? This whole city?</p>, <p>It didn't make sense. Why would the surface be so neglected that it was the last place to be developed, to be made habitable for people? She thought of her family and their humble history, working hard to carve out a life for themselves in the frontier kingdoms and the pride they had felt at what they achieved in such trying circumstances.</p>, <p>Was it all a joke? There's an entire city down here! Long before her ancestors had even thought to join the expedition to the frontier.</p>, <p>As she muddled through her conflicted feelings the passage they were travelling through suddenly opened into a vast hall. Mirryn gasped, shocked out of her thoughts by the grand scale of the space they now occupied. A high arched ceiling, buttressed by powerful columns of stone and been carved straight into the rock, ornate, almost delicate supports stretched across the empty space to give strength and proportion to the stone.</p>, <p>Clusters of glowstones illuminated the room in bright light, causing Mirryn to squint against the sudden glare. Down the center of the room, between the columns stood two rows of stone statues raised on marble plinths. Each of the figures was a masterpiece. Incredibly detailed, perfectly proportioned. The level of skill that would go into making such a perfect piece of art boggled the young Legionaries minds.</p>, <p>Each of the statues was a Legionary. Men and women in full battle armour, weapons in hand, standing ready. Most of them were of advanced age, clearly senior officers or veteran soldiers. Scars criss-crossed their faces and arms and their expressions were hard, as if there was little they hadn't seen. So lifelike were they that it felt as if they could jump down from their plinths and stride into battle at any moment.</p>, <p>\"This the hall of remembrance\" Aurillia said over her shoulder, \"here the greatest members of our branch have been immortilised in stone, preserved for history and for the battles to come\".</p>, <p>She pointed to one of the figures towards the end of the room as they continued to stride through the hall. \"Over there is commander Titus' father, Magnus\".</p>, <p>Almost despite themselves the young Legionaries felt their heads snap around to stare at the statue in the distance. A tall, bull shouldered figure stood there, a great two handed hammer resting on the plinth and held casually in one hand. Even at this distance Mirryn could see that the statues features, broad chin, stern eyes and thick neck were the same as commander Titus.</p>, <p>Some of the trainees were somewhat surprised to learn the commander even had a father. They'd felt as if he'd walked fully formed out of a mountain side…</p>, <p>Once through the hall they were quickly brought into the armoury. Before a large ornate door stood the commander himself, a rare half smile on his lips as he watched his newest Legionaries assemble before him.</p>, <p>Oddly he didn't say a word to them. He simply turned and pushed open the door before indicating with his head that they should walk through.</p>, <p>Mirryn had somehow found herself in the front. Feeling somewhat nervous she stepped through the grand door and into the darkened space on the other side, cautiously letting her eyes adjust to the gloom before moving too far.</p>, <p>As her vision improved her footsteps slowed until she was completely still, dumbstruck.</p>, <p>Lining the walls on either side of the room where massive suits of armour of obsidian stone and polished steel. An endless network of enchantments webbed the plates, the glittering blue light of residual mana providing most of the illumination in the space.</p>, <p>'What the heck are these?' Mirryn thought in wonder.</p>, <p>The commander grinned. \"Who wants to suit up first?\" he asked.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Dazed, my minds went blank for a terrifying moment before clarity returned to me and I focused my awareness on the mind bridge that connected the Commander to me. What the hell had just happened?!</p>, <p>Somehow, in the midst of all that it was enduring in this moment, the damned Croc had possessed the presence of mind to detect the mental connection that I had created between us and use it to strike at me directly.</p>, <p>Really, you stupid Croc!? With a giant bat faced gorilla punching your lights out and a writhing mass of tentacle death descending upon you, the little ant who'd created a mind bridge threatened you the most?! I think you have messed up your priorities!</p>, <p>Another pulse of mana flooded down the bridge, but this time I was prepared and focused my will to resist the impact. I felt as if I'd braced myself to be hit wrecking ball. The mental strike smashed into my awareness and rattled it like a tin can. I grit my mandibles and brought all of my Will to bare in order to prevent myself from blacking out and dropping the bridge.</p>, <p>If the stupid Croc is so threated by the mind bridge them I'm sure as hell going to maintain it. Even if it's going to burn through mana faster than I wanted to, especially after coming so close to having exterminated myself through this exact problem.</p>, <p>I didn't want to have spend my mana quite so profligately as this but these big monsters aren't the kind that we can take on without going all out. I just hope that I don't end up in empty core territory again, that sensation was… uncomfortable, to put it mildly.</p>, <p>But how can I utilise this bridge to attack the Croc? Come to think of it, how on earth is this Croc using the Bridge to attack me!? I doubt very much that it's capable of constructing a mana transformation construct, does it have a mind magic gland? Why the heck would an evil two mouthed Croc have a need for a mind magic gland?! This horrific looking monstrosity hasn't communicated with another organism except through the medium of fire in its entire life!</p>, <p>The beast appeared to judge that I'd been incapacitated by its mental strikes and turned its attention to fending off the relentless assault from Tiny. Repeatedly rocked by the apes tremendous fists the Croca-Commander has taken some damage, blood dripped from a number of open wounds where Tiny had managed to crack its scales.</p>, <p>Now the Croc had enough room to swing with both arms on its right side, the wide swipe forced Tiny to retreat backwards and the Croc made use of the space to open its top jaws as it unleashed a gout of fire towards my ape pet.</p>, <p>What I saw then I shall never forget.</p>, <p>Tiny had been falling backwards, off balance after the savage swing from the Croc, the follow up fireball should have turned him into a roasted side of ape, but instead, a miracle occurred. One moment, Tiny was flat footed as he stumbled backward, the next moment he'd risen onto the balls of his feet, his tense expression faded to be replaced by one extreme calm,. Then he floated to one side, executed a graceful pirouette and avoided the flame breath of the Titan Croc with ease.</p>, <p>What the hell was that?! When did you learn how to move with such, such grace and precision? His feet flickered so quick was his movement.</p>, <p>Wait a sec.</p>, <p>Is that fancy feet?! That suspicious dance related skill? When the heck have you been practicing that you brute?! Have you been dancing when I can't see you, you cursed ape?! If you had a skill that was so useful why the heck didn't you let me know about it? I'll ignore the fact that I could have checked the details by examining his core but I'll put that to one side. I never bothered because the name of the skill seemed to be so frivolous that I didn't think it mattered. Even now, as I pictured myself dancing and floating around enemy strikes, my six legs flailing in the air, I just don't feel like the skill would be for me.</p>, <p>It's sure to hit flame strike missed, the Croca-Commander was slow to react to this light footed ape and Tiny slid to the creatures side, raised his fists and continued to deliver justice. By now Crinis had managed to bind two of the creatures arms together and begun her gruesome work, the teeth that lined her tentacles ground and sliced away at the Croc who appeared to be less than enjoying the experience.</p>, <p>This damn Croc. It's so damn tough it'll take some time for Crinis to get through, and though Tiny is doing good work, the damage hasn't piled up as quickly as I'd like. The thing that we need to keep aware of is the mana attrition we are experiencing. I've burned through a chunk of my reserves already by creating this mind bridge, and the trickly of mana from my core into the Gravitational Mana gland is a constant worry.</p>, <p>Similarly, Tiny has expended lightning with every strike, and his core needs to replenish two mana glands, which will increase his expenditure. The Croc must be suffering in a similar way. As a matter of fact, it should be worse. They're a long way from the nearest Dungeon entrance and according to Morrelia have been marching straight back toward the capital, no doubt to enter the Dungeon there and bathe in the sweet, sweet mana there.</p>, <p>Considering that the Croca-Commander is two or more evolutions ahead of me, the drain on its core must be significantly higher. The Croc seems to have been willing to unleash its flames quite freely so far, I wonder how much further it can afford to do so.</p>, <p>Morrelia has swept into the battle by this stage, cutting through the chaff like a double bladed demon. Deep in her Berserker rage she roared and screamed at her foes as she lacerated them with her twin swords, causing her to be covered in gore.</p>, <p>Nasty.</p>, <p>At least she's kept the small fry off our backs.</p>, <p>Time to deal with this Croc. Distracted my Tiny and Crinis I reach deep into myself with all of my minds working together in concert, exerting the full force of my intellect upon my mana. Inside me the mind mana transformation construct glows like an ethereal arch and I bring my will to bare, producing mind attribute mana and condensing it swiftly.</p>, <p>With my improved skill and the concentrated effort of all of my brains I weave together a sending for the Croca that is based off an experience that I shall not soon forget: the searing, agonizing pain of an empty core. Deftly I weave in the pain, the fear, the desperation and uncertainty into a tight little ball that I fire across the mind bridge and straight into the Croca-Commander's brain.</p>, <p>Enjoy that sucka!</p>]\n",

            "[<p>When my dish of curated agony arrived at its destination the Croc responded much as I would have expected, with unabridged terror and anguish. The sheer terror and pain of ones' core being drained is unique experience and I'm glad I had the chance to share it with this particular Croca-Commander. I feel gratified that I suffered for a noble cause.</p>, <p>Stunned by the sudden arrival of such a dense and rich package of sensation through the mind bridge that connected us, the Croca appeared to be unable to resist its effects and succumbed for a moment to the illusion that the sensations it felt were real and not, in fact, crafted by a nefarious ant.</p>, <p>In my experience utilising mental warfare, I've found that it's generally the case that a monster has a chance to 'resist' your sending through sheer force of mind. I have suspected that this resistance is based upon the Will stat in some way, which is why I had been worried the Croca may be somewhat impervious to my mental strikes. Not so. It seemed that the impressive physique of the Croca-Commander hadn't come without a cost.</p>, <p>Tiny, we have found your spiritual brothers here in the Croca-Beasts! Tough as nails and just as intelligent!</p>, <p>The monstrous crocodile reeled in horror at the pain it felt emanate from within, arms flailed and the creature attempted to fling Tiny and Crinis away but the two pets were persistent, not willing to allow the beast to escape.</p>, <p>Chance!</p>, <p>I flexed my legs and dashed toward the Croca at full speed. I closed the distance in a few seconds, my mandibles opened wide and ready to deliver their own particular brand of law and order.</p>, <p>CHOMP!</p>, <p>I poured my strength into the muscle that lined my head and bit down with every ounce strength in my body. One bite is never enough! No ant was ever intended to win through an alpha strike! Bite, Bite and Bite some more!</p>, <p>I wasn't willing to continue to empty my mana from my core, so I refrained from infusing my mandibles with mana and relied on their base destructive power. I'm the first to admit that my destructive power is somewhat lacking, that's nothing new, but with my skills and high level of mutation I can at least contribute something on the ground level.</p>, <p>I'm not willing to keep flinging spells, that's for sure! After so recently going through the experience myself, I was in no rush to taste those sweet delights again.</p>, <p>Forced to use Splintering Chomp due to the solid defences of the Croca, I work as mechanically as possible, bite, open, bite, open, as I tried to pierce through the hard scales of the monsters' leg and puncture the sweet, succulent muscle tissue beneath.</p>, <p>Tiny continued to unleash his barrage of punches even as his feet flickered above the ground as he shifted his weight to suite his punches. Electricity sparked and danced every time he struck home and the damage was piling up.</p>, <p>For her part, Crinis focused on keeping the two arms she had control of bound and contained as her saw teeth went to work. In order to escalate her damage she switched gears slightly and shifted her head so that she had access to chomp down with her terror inducing teeth on the Crocs shoulder.</p>, <p>Which may have been a mistake since the pain of having those fangs sink deep into its shoulder seemed to be enough to shock the Croca-Commander out of the delusion that I had supplied it. Its eyes flashed red as it bellowed with frustration and rage. Still light on his feet, Tiny managed to slip out of range as the Croc flailed at him with its two free arms, its claws raked through the air leaving a shining trail of light as it executed a skill.</p>, <p>Holy mackerel! That looked sharp!</p>, <p>Quick as beat the Crocodile switched its play and turned to snap at Crinis with its vicious upper jaws.</p>, <p>[Crinis watch - ] I called but not quickly enough.</p>, <p>Thankfully it didn't matter as Crinis artfully dodged, her entire body morphed out of the way, her shadow displayed its flexibility, and incredible ability to compress itself, her body chose to be where the jaws were not.</p>, <p>[Nice, Crinis! Be careful up there!] I cheered.</p>, <p>I wonder if that’s a skill that she picked up? That level of movement, the speed she was able to do it, I haven't seen her do anything like that before. Her body has always been somewhat, amorphous, able to be compressed from her full, inflated ball of death down to a mere softball of implied illness.</p>, <p>This is a different type of shift, as the Crocs jaws closed in she retracted the part of her body that would have been bitten, whilst leaving the rest of it alone. For a moment it even looked as if the Croca had bitten a chunk out of her since there was nothing but air remaining when it withdrew its teeth.</p>, <p>I refuse to sit by and let the pets do all of the work!</p>, <p>HAH!</p>, <p>Digging deep it reared back and crunched down with a Splintering Chomp. A resplendent crunching sound rang out as my mandibles pierced through the crocs scales and bit deep into the leg beneath. With a load groan the commander staggered to one side and I seized the opportunity to pull it off balance and threw my weight to one side, gripping the earth with my claws and hauling on the Croca-Commander with my jaws still lodged in its leg.</p>, <p>Timber!</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Slowly at first, then with increasing speed, the Garralosh Commander tilted to one side before it came crashing down to the dirt.</p>, <p>BOOM!</p>, <p>The ground vibrated under the weight of its frame as it slammed down, rattling my legs and sending me scrambling to ensure I wasn't crushed as it came down. Ha, ha! That's how it's done! I hope Tiny saw that, he'll be irritated to no end that I managed to bring it the ground before he did. Gweheheheh!</p>, <p>\"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\" someone screamed.</p>, <p>Ah?! Morrelia?!</p>, <p>She's finished off the chaff already?! Focusing my near 360 degree vision I can see that its true, the broken and sliced remains of her foes litter the ground behind her as she charges toward us, her eyes burning with rage and her face twisted in a vicious snarl. Her two blades are held low and pointing directly at the Croca Commander as she charges, her dash skill allowing her to move with unnatural speed.</p>, <p>You want to make your glorious entrance now?! When the work is almost done!? Well, I guess it doesn't matter that much, help is certainly welcome when challenging a monster as powerful as this, even wounded as it is.</p>, <p>And we have wounded it. Crinis has been biting and sawing away at two of the monsters' arms and shoulder for a while now and her work has been rewarded. The scales have been penetrated and ichor is dripping down from between her tentacles. It won't be much longer and the Croc is going to be down to half arms. Even if she doesn't get that far, those two arms don't look as though they'll be much use in the near future, not without some serious healing.</p>, <p>Tiny has done more work, certainly more than I expected him to be able to do. His punches have impressive destructive potential on their own, powered by his massive physique, but with him discharging bolts of electricity into the Croc with each blow he's been savaging the inside of the monster just as badly as he has the outside. Of the three of us, the most raw HP damage has been dealt my the ape, for sure.</p>, <p>My own contributions have been a bit more on the utility side, slowing the monster, gumming it up with acid, weakening its defences and attacking it mentally in order to provide openings for my two pets to take advantage of. I don't mind playing the support role for now but I have to say I don't feel it suits my temperament, I want to be right in the thick of things, slapping down the enemies of justice with my face hands. Hopefully after my next evolution I can address my current physical weakness.</p>, <p>All in good time. I still need to try and finish absorbing the rare core before I can even think of evolution.</p>, <p>Arriving as a storm of metal, Morrelia begins stabbing with incredible ferocity before the Commander can even right itself after falling to the ground. Her two blades don't bite too deep with each strike, but sheer weight of attacks is going to add up quick at the pace she's going. At this speed she might even be the one to score the last hit.</p>, <p>….</p>, <p>w-, wait a sec!</p>, <p>THAT EXPERIENCE IS MIIIIIIIINE!</p>, <p>[Tiny! Hold down the handbags arms on your side. Jump on them if you have to! Crinis! Wrap up his jaws!]</p>, <p>[I might not be able to hold too long Master! Holding its arms together is already stretching my limits!]</p>, <p>[Just do it! I only need you to hold for a little while! We can't let Morrelia steal the experience!]</p>, <p>[What!?] Crinis roared, appalled at the thought, [how dare this woman dream of stealing experience from Master?! It won't happen!]</p>, <p>As if possessed by a demon, Crinis lashed out with her tentacles, wrapping them around the Croca-Commanders jaws and straining to hold them shut.</p>, <p>[Nice, Crinis!] I cheered.</p>, <p>Even as she moved, Tiny had followed orders and leapt bodily onto the creatures other side, landing heavily on its arms before simply throwing his whole body down on them, using his weight to pin the limbs to the ground. The Croca-Commander writhed and fought to resist the grip of the monsters wrestling it to the ground. Had it been at full strength then I doubt we would have been able to achieve this, the damn thing is simply too strong. But here and now, on the surface? This Croc is running on fumes.</p>, <p>This is my chance!</p>, <p>With all four arms accounted for, the twin jaws sealed by the limbs of Crinis and the tails pinned down by the creatures own body, there will never be a better time to strike than now! Morrelia has continued her furious flurry of strikes, her arms and chest coated with the ichor that is now spraying for the deep wounds she is beginning to inflict. I'm not even certain that she's trying to steal the last hit, I think she's just deep in the depths of her rage, but I can't give this up! I've gotta go fast!</p>, <p>Desperate to achieve the last hit, I draw out mana from my core and direct it into my mandibles as I launched myself onto the struggling monsters chest. The Croc struggled even more furiously when it realised it was being stepped on by an ant, literally, but there was nothing it could do in the moment as my mandibles began to glow bright with the influx of raw mana.</p>, <p>I'm going straight for the throat!</p>, <p>*Shattering Bite!*</p>, <p>With a ferocious crunch, my mandibles extended out as my energy manifested itself in air and came down with the satisfying sound of a symphony of smashed scales.</p>, <p>Not enough! Let's keep this wagon rolling!</p>, <p>*Bite!* *Bite!* *Bite!*</p>, <p>With each chomp I dig deeper and the Croca's struggles grow weaker, until finally…</p>, <p>[You have slain level 53 Garralosh Commander]</p>, <p>[You have gained experience]</p>, <p>[You have reached level 27, one skill point awarded]</p>, <p>[You have reached level 28, one skill point awarded]</p>, <p>[You have reached level 29, one skill point awarded]</p>, <p>[You have reached level 30, one skill point awarded]</p>, <p>YASS! The XP is MINE!</p>, <p>Take that Morrelia you poaching - …</p>, <p>\"ggggggGGGGGGGGRRRRRROOOOOOOWLLLLLLLL!\"</p>, <p>….</p>, <p>What the heck was that?!</p>]\n",

            "[<p>That growl was so low, and so powerful, I could feel it rattle my external bones. What in the name of the ever loving ant queen is going on?!</p>, <p>Tiny, Crinis and I froze in place the moment we heard that unearthly rumble, still locked in our moment of triumph over the fallen foe. The Croca-Commander lies still beneath me, its neck torn asunder my mandible assault and I allow the mana to fade from my choppers. Morrelia is standing to one side of the monster, both of her blades buried halfway to the hilt in its flank as she comes out of her berserk rage.</p>, <p>Her face appears red and gaunt as she heaves deep breaths into her lungs, the light of anger and bloodlust fading from her eyes and clarity of thought returning. She looked down at the defeated Croca-Commander as if surprised to see it there, a flicker of confusion came over her expression and she slowly shook her head from left to right.</p>, <p>Grooooooooowl!</p>, <p>Again that deep rumbling growl rattled out from a distance, seeming to shake the very land itself beneath our feet. The only one present in the moment to not appear nervous at this development was Tiny, who only appeared satisfied as he gazed down on his defeated foe.</p>, <p>Checking on my core hastily I see that there is still a good 50% capacity still in the tank. The fight was a lot shorter and sharper than I expected it to be, most likely due to the Croc not being able to fully utilise its ability due to wanting to conserve mana itself. I shouldn't discount the possibility that the Croc was already extremely low on mana, which may explain the relatively low amount of fire it spat at us.</p>, <p>If I recall correctly, the first Croc-Commander we fought burnt down a good section of the Marsh expanse without even trying. I've no doubt this double chinned beast could unleash a similar level of devastation if it so wanted. Inside the Dungeon that is, up here? Who knows?</p>, <p>Satisfied that I wasn't likely to run out of mana in the short-term future I begin work on re-establishing the mind bridge to Morrelia that I had let lapse during the fight. I'll still need to be careful, mana-wise. I burned a good chunk of gravitational mana in the fight and I can feel the gland drawing away mana from my core to replenish its stock. Normally, not a problem, the core is replenished a heck of a lot faster than the gland can drain it away, especially when I can get my feet stuck into some Dungeon turf. On the surface, my core does not absorb mana fast enough to sustain me under ideal circumstances, let alone with any extra demands on it. I'll need to retreat back to our mini-Dungeon base to refill the tank before we go any further. Better safe than sorry.</p>, <p>[What's the problem Morrelia? You're looking a little confused?]</p>, <p>[Have you been hearing those growls?] she asked, a little vaguely.</p>, <p>[Well, yeah? Of course. I felt like my carapace had been jammed into a sub-woofer. Way too much base. Do you have any idea what might be causing it?]</p>, <p>Instead of answering my question, Morrelia posed another of her own.</p>, <p>[Do you know what species of monster this is?] she asked, pointing at our victim.</p>, <p>[Yup. Garralosh Commander, no doubt about it. One of the eldest children of Garralosh herself. This is the second time we've put one down] I boasted a little bit, even as my antennae wave back and forth attempting to sense the source of the intimidating noise.</p>, <p>[Have you ever seen it?] Morrelia asked faintly, [Garralosh, I mean?]</p>, <p>Surprised by the question, I turned my whole body to face Morrelia.</p>, <p>[Ah, no. Why? Have you?] I asked incredulously.</p>, <p>GGGGROOOOOOOOOOOOWWLLLLLL!!!!</p>, <p>Again that bone rattling growl!? What in the name of heck is it?</p>, <p>[I think we might be about to] Morrelia muttered.</p>, <p>Waaaait a second. That is the sound of GARRALOSH GROWLING?! I though it a freaking earth tremor or something! No way a monster can make that kind of noise?!</p>, <p>[Are you sure?!] I demanded.</p>, <p>She turned toward me.</p>, <p>[You want to find out?]</p>, <p>[Absolutely not!]</p>, <p>I barked out orders to Tiny and Crinis.</p>, <p>[We are getting out of here on the double! I want to take a few cuts of this prime Croc and then we skedaddle, stage left!]</p>, <p>Morrelia didn't bother to wait for us, turning to run as soon as she realised what we were doing and sprinting at top speed back down the trail we followed.</p>, <p>Tiny and Crinis leapt into action and I assisted in the rather disgusting task of Biomass butchery. The whole Croc was way too heavy for us to carry, but were we really willing to leave behind hundreds of Biomass points lying in the dirt?!</p>, <p>We may be stupid but at least we are stupid for greed!</p>, <p>[Cut like you mean it Crinis! We need to be out of here five minutes ago!] I bellowed.</p>, <p>[What's a minute?!] Crinis wailed.</p>, <p>[Just hurry up!]</p>, <p>In reality it only took two minutes for us to finish separating the two arms that Crinis had been working on during the fight and one of the legs which Tiny promptly picked up and we were out of there!</p>, <p>[Go! Go! Go dammit! Move those legs!] I roared at Tiny as he struggled to run whilst carrying his grisly cargo under his arms. Crinis collapsed onto my back the moment we were finished carving and retracted to her compact, travel sized sphere.</p>, <p>Dashing with all of our strength the trees became a blur as we raced as quickly as possible to put distance between us and the scene of the battle. The inside of my carapace was sweating bullets at the thought of big momma Garralosh rolling over the horizon and burning us all to death in an instant.</p>, <p>Horrible visions of six headed crocodiles with nine tails fill my mind and it isn't long before I'm focusing my attention on the horizon behind us, waiting to see if our doom approaches!</p>, <p>[Come on Tiny, run faster! Eat an arm or something, pick up the pace!]</p>, <p>Only too happy to oblige, Tiny continues to run whilst stuffing his face as we flee from the shadow of the mother of all crocodiles.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>A hundred of the most highly trained and powerful warriors within the Liria Bulwark sat in the tunnels, sweat and grime covering their forms. Each of them was exhausted. They’d battled for hours here, on the edge of the defensive line. Wave after wave of shadow beasts had assaulted their position. Even the odd demon had been mixed in, something that Myrrin had never thought she’d see.</p>, <p>A tap at her shoulder caused Myrrin to turn and then raise her head to gaze up at the monstrous auxiliary soldier beside her. Unable to talk with a grotesquely fanged muzzle where his mouth had once been, he raised his claw tipped paws instead and gestured to her in the simple but effective sign language she’d learned at the fort.</p>, <p>She watched his hands intently for a moment before she shook her head.</p>, <p>\"No idea. I’ve heard stories, but I’ve never seen anything like...\" she gestured helplessly toward the scene that held them all captive for the last twenty minutes. \"... that.\"</p>, <p>Head cocked to one side, the auxiliary listened carefully then nodded politely and turned back to watch the spectacle. Mirryn kept her eye on him for a moment longer before she turned back. It had taken her some time to grow accustomed to the auxiliaries. Half human, half monster, they were not a pretty sight to see. Not to mention, no two were ever the same. The twisted mutations they manifested depended in part on the monster flesh they were fed, and in part on the human being, she’d be told. Still, after fighting alongside them this last week, she’d gotten over her reservations. Condemned criminals they may have been, down here, they were Legion.</p>, <p>A blinding flash of light from in front caused her to shut her eyes and a deafening crash followed by a hail of stones and debris announced the use of another rock shattering skill. The constant howl and scream of monsters was dimmed for just a second before it rose once more to fever pitch.</p>, <p>It was hell, down here. Day in, day out, they’d fought and battled until they could no longer stand, until their hands no longer worked and they needed to be pried out of their armour, scrubbed down by workers and thrown into a bed for a few hours of nightmare plagued sleep. Then back into the action. Mirryn had fired so many arrows, slain so many monsters, she was sure the Dungeon would have been empty by now. But it didn’t make a dent. Nothing did. This was only one fort along the Bulwark and hundreds of thousands of monsters had met their doom here. But it was never enough.</p>, <p>Mirryn turned to her other side and laid a hand on the scarred runic metal of her new partner. The Abyssal armour she’d been issued, a fine example of the medium sized ’Ranger’ pattern that she’d been wearing throughout the conflict. Since they’d been relieved at the front she figured she may as well take it off and rest for a moment. It wasn’t exactly heavy, but wearing the armour was taxing on the mind and spirit.</p>, <p>BOOM!</p>, <p>Another impact pierced the shriek of monsters and another shower of dust and rock battered into the tunnel walls, drawing her attention back to the battle still taking place not even fifty metres from where she sat.</p>, <p>Encased in his oversized, rune inscribed Abyssal armour, the commander held the tunnel, by himself. The great axe in his hands hummed with delight as each swing send red blades of light tearing through dozens of monsters at once. Every now and again, he would stomp down with one armoured foot and the tunnel itself would shake, which forced everything in front of him to stumble, which allowed him to wind up another swing.</p>, <p>He’d been at it for twenty minutes already.</p>, <p>They’d been fighting as usual, when the commander had just shown up, pushed his way to the front, and started tearing monsters apart with those wide, impossibly powerful swings. They’d tried to help at first, but the commander had gestured them to move back and kept going. So they had. It felt surreal, to be here at the front and not fighting. She could tell from the bemused expressions of those around her that they felt the same.</p>, <p>Mirryn sighed. Every muscle ached. In fact, she could barely remember a time when they hadn’t ached. What had life been like, before she’d come down into the Dungeon on this delve? What did the sun even look like? It hardly mattered, it was bright enough down here, the tunnels had blazed with light constantly ever since the wave had started.</p>, <p>As she pondered the glare of the Dungeon her eyes flicked towards the veins that lined the tunnel. She thought for a moment, a frown creased her face as she tried to register what it was that she thought she saw. She stood slowly and began to walk toward the closest wall, her attention fixated on it to the point even the horrific sounds of battle faded from her mind.</p>, <p>There was something about the walls. Something about the mana veins. She stared straight at one from only a few metres away. Since when had she started to be unable to stare straight at one? But now she could. Now she could. Because... the mana ... was decreasing?</p>, <p>In one motion she turned and sprinted back toward where her fellow Legionaries were resting, shouting at the top of her lungs like a mad banshee.</p>, <p>\"The mana is decreasing! The wave is ending! The mana is decreasing!\"</p>, <p>At first they looked at her as if she were mad. What did she think she was doing, but gradually they realised what it was she was saying, what it could mean if it was true. One by one they turned to the walls and looked for themselves. It didn’t take long for them to confirm with their own eyes what she had said, and with delighted roars of triumph the Legion leapt to its feet.</p>, <p>There was jubilation, hugs, even the monster auxiliaries were howling and snarling with glee.</p>, <p>With spirits renewed and joy in their hearts, the Legionaries suited up, readied their weapons and charged into battle alongside the tireless commander. One last push! One last push and then it would all be over!</p>, <p>Five hours later, Mirryn lay flat on the ground of the tunnel, still in her armour. The flow of monsters had begun to decrease at last, and when the relieving force had arrived from Raileh, her squad had chosen to stay on for an extra hour to help beat the last of the enemy back.</p>, <p>In truth, with the commander there, it had been the easiest shift she’d had across the entire wave.</p>, <p>The man wasn’t human. Mirryn understood that in some ways, neither was she, but Titus was so far beyond her own limits he simply couldn’t be the same species anymore. Just what did a Legionary have to go through to get that strong?</p>, <p>She wasn’t sure she wanted to know.</p>, <p>With a grimace, she sat up and took stock. The battle still raged, but at a reduced cadence, some two hundred metres away. She’d retreated back to the fort proper and most of the Legionaries on her shift were still here, taking a brief rest before they hit their bunks.</p>, <p>The commander was still on his feet. He walked from soldier to soldier, a word here, a pat on the soldier there. His eyes gleamed with fierce energy all the while. He didn’t even look tired. When he saw her staring, he said a final word to the Legionary he was speaking with and moved toward her.</p>, <p>\"Finally getting my mana levels back to where they used to be,\" he told her quietly. \"Taken quite a while to get my motor running again.\"</p>, <p>It was clear he’d seen what she was thinking and Mirryn couldn’t help but blush at how easily she was read.</p>, <p>\"I’ve never seen anything like it, commander. I didn’t mean to be rude.\"</p>, <p>He waved a hand to dismiss her concern.</p>, <p>\"Don’t think much of it. Those of us who’ve served the deep, are a little different than most. You haven’t met any Legionaries who’ve been that low other than me. We rarely come back up at all.\"</p>, <p>\"Why did you then, commander?\"</p>, <p>He paused for a moment, a little of the light went out of his eyes.</p>, <p>\"My children. My wife became pregnant and I requested a transfer to the surface.\"</p>, <p>\"I’m sorry, sir. I shouldn’t have pried.\"</p>, <p>\"It’s fine.\"</p>, <p>A tussle behind them at the entrance to the fort broke the awkward silence before it could truly settle and a haggard-looking messenger burst forward.</p>, <p>\"Commander, sir! The Dungeon Seers have reported. Garralosh has been slain!\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It took two days to clear the battlefield. Two whole days of the entire colony working around the clock, hauling, cutting, storing and generally stuffing their faces at every possible moment. Even with so many ants eating so much, the nest was still stuffed to the brim with Biomass that needed to get consumed yesterday. The Queen had consumed the most, from the moment she had recovered until she's been forced to rest by concerned members of the twenty. Well, the nineteen now, I suppose.</p>, <p>Grant's core had been recovered, but nobody suggested we reconstitute her. Having a member of the family, a sibling, start following one of us around as a pet was too weird for any ant to consider. This did mean there was an opening on the council, which I suppose would need to be filled at some point. I have no idea how they plan on going about that, try and find the next oldest soldier? Raise up a new council from scratch? I don't want to be involved, whatever they decide.</p>, <p>I mean, believe me, I've got my own problems. Tiny, Crinis and I had started consuming the Biomass that had once been Garralosh and it didn't take us long to realise a few things. One, it did feel a bit strange to be consuming the monstrous remains that had once housed a human being. Two, as expected of the old monster, she was Biomass rich. And three, there was no way we were going to be able to get through all of it before it dissolved to nothing. Garralosh was one chunky croc. She must have weighed around twenty tons! Even after a good chunk was lost to the Gravity Bomb, we couldn't handle it at all. Not to mention the core we dug out of her. I don't even want to think about that massive thing.</p>, <p>And since this food was the most rich of all, I decided it would make the most sense if it was consumed first. After we had filled ourselves to the brim, and all of my stomachs were packed, I told the surrounding ants to dig in, eat some for themselves, take some to the Queen, take some to Victoriant and her sister as well.</p>, <p>Spread the love, you know?</p>, <p>The next thing I realised was that I couldn't stay up on the surface for nearly as long as I could before. The mana in my core flooded out at a truly disturbing rate. By the time I finished eating, I was practically running on fumes and had to roll my swollen abdomen back into the nest. It was a lot harder to manoeuvre in there since my evolution, quite a few tunnels were too small for me to even consider entering. I was able to make my way down to my old resting chamber and rested there.</p>, <p>And so, for the last two days the ever ongoing cycle of eating and resting had repeated themselves until the surface was somewhat back to normal, the carpet of Biomass had been consumed, and the colony was able to return to business as usual. Brood production went back into overdrive, the Queen now producing three hundred eggs per day. Not satisfied with this rate of growth, the colony sought to take advantage of the fading vestiges of the wave and took Victoriant and Antionette out of the nest and into the Dungeon for a power levelling spree.</p>, <p>By the evening of the second day they returned to the nest in triumph! Both of them settled in to evolve to the fourth tier where they would begin their lives as egg producing Queens of the colony. There was quite a lot of energy amongst the nest at that, I have to say. A great deal of excitement and anticipation. It felt as if the very first Formica Sapiens colony had reached a major milestone of producing our first home grown egg laying Queens.</p>, <p>As they were evolving, Tiny, Crinis and I have a small opportunity to take stock. I'm super happy that the wave is receding, obviously. Far less danger, the ease of exploration is opening up again. There's a ton of stuff I want to do in the Dungeon after all. I've been hoping to check in on the Sophos for ages, for example. I know they can't be too far away, beneath Liria somewhere, for sure. I really want to go deeper and see how things work down there, forge a path for the colony and all that. But more to the point, as the mana levels are falling, my little hidey hole, so close to the surface, isn't providing me with enough juice! I have to go deeper in order to live!</p>, <p>Stupid Dungeon.</p>, <p>The Queen has it even worse than I do. Her chamber has been relocated to a much deeper location, forcing the colony to expand down toward the swamp expanse. With spawn rates returning to normal levels, we are easily able to handle such a project. The colony has grown strong, and from here out will only explode in capability.</p>, <p>I also have a ton of skill points and Biomass I need to deal with, I picked up a heap of levels from my fight with Garralosh, as I expected from a battle with a creature so far above me. I'll have to deal with that sooner or later. For now though, I'm not too bothered. I'm looking forward to a more relaxing existence where I'm not stressing about dying every second of the day.</p>, <p>No existential crises! No imminent doom! I feel as if I just slip into torpor and stay there for a few weeks. I don't want to do a thing!</p>, <p>Of course, I can't do that. The nest is positively buzzing with activity and energy. Brood Tenders are rearing and teaching, mage ants and core shapers are experimenting, carvers are building and studying. Even the soldiers and scouts have gone nuts, hunting and exploring in the Dungeon without pause, eking every little bit of experience and Biomass they can get before the wave is over.</p>, <p>It seems as if once the surface clean-up was complete, I fell in a heap whilst the rest of the colony just kept on going. The guilt is overpowering! Or perhaps that guilt is just the constant niggle of whispers and tugs that filter through the Vestibule. I don't want to think too closely on that though, instead, I ignore it with all my strength!</p>, <p>So I finally pick myself up and head up and out of the nest. I may as well pay the humans a visit before I wander off, just to make sure they aren't doing anything too stupid. With Crinis riding on my now much more spacious back and Tiny following behind, I make my way out of the nest only to pause when we crest the top of the hill and come across a team of carvers working on something that appears to be shaped from solid earth.</p>, <p>\"What are you guys… oh my god.\"</p>, <p>The dozen workers jump at my words and pull back to reveal that the massive project they are cooperating on is an earth carving of me, post evolution. I appear to be standing watch over the entrance to the colony, my steely eyes and noble antennae are matched by my fierce mandibles and aggressive pose. The statue manages to convey a sense of protectiveness and dignity that I'm fairly confident I don't possess.</p>, <p>The carvers are frozen as if they were naughty children caught with their hands in the biscuit tin. For my part, I have no idea what to say and can only shake my head in disbelief.</p>, <p> Find authorized novels in Webnovel，faster updates, better experience，Please click www.webnovel.com for visiting. </p>, <p> After a minute, I turn to walk toward the human village.</p>, <p>\"Make one for Grant,\" I tell them.</p>, <p>The carvers each look at each other before they nod and begin to shape the soil next to my own effigy.</p>, <p>I have to wonder, where the hell did they get the idea for that?</p>]\n",

From our wall we were able to watch the whole fight. Not to mention the healers who appeared during the battle to cure our wounded. There isn't a single person in the village who could say they don't have at least one family member who was directly saved by them.]</p>, <p>[Gratitude I understand. Gratitude would be completely fine! This isn't gratitude! What the heck is this?!]</p>, <p>Enid shrugged helplessly.</p>, <p>[With sentiment running high before the battle took place. It's obviously going to be overflowing now that it's done, considering what happened! These people have lost everything, Anthony, they need something to cling onto. Something to give them hope for the future.]</p>, <p>[I cannot believe you okayed this. Did you fall on your head or something? A monster clock you with a rock? It blows my mind that anyone at all thinks this is a good idea!]</p>, <p>My frustration is starting to bubble over and I can't help stabbing forward with my antennae toward the monstrosity that we are currently discussing.</p>, <p>Enid hesitates before she speaks again, but speak she does.</p>, <p>[You have to admit that you aren't much like a normal monster. Or... Anything like a normal monster. Are you sure there wasn't anything unusual about your creation?]</p>, <p>[Of course not,] I deadpan, [pure ant right down to my claws.]</p>, <p>I have no idea if the humans on the surface know about monsters inhabited by humans from Earth like the Sophos are, but I'm sure as hell not going to be the one to tell them.</p>, <p>Enid frowns at me as she adjusts her shawl. I say nothing to appease her suspicions.</p>, <p>[Don't distract from the subject at hand, Enid! That ,] I stab one antenna toward the construction, [is going to cause a lot of problems.]</p>, <p>She could only shrug helplessly.</p>, <p>[I don't think even you could convince them to take it down. I'm not sure that I even want them to.]</p>, <p>[You've fallen to the dark side Enid.]</p>, <p>[The what?]</p>, <p>[Do not give up hope. There is always another chance to walk in the light.]</p>, <p>[I have no idea what you mean.]</p>, <p>I'm not happy about this situation, but I'm not sure what I can reasonably do about it.</p>, <p>Enid and I stand on a slight hill as we gaze at the feverish construction taking place not twenty metres away. Men and women sweat in the heat as they work, digging, flattening, squaring stones. The foundations are already starting to take place of what will certainly be a far too large a structure of imposing stone.</p>, <p>To one side, a worker is going to town on a granite boulder. Already the ant-like features are starting to take shape of what I'm told will eventually be a mighty statue of me. Ant observers are about the place as well, members of the colony who've snuck over for a sticky beak and see what the humans are up to. Turns out a couple of mages have even managed to unlock the mind magic skill. It's difficult for them to use it with any level of proficiency, or for very long, but already early communication attempts have been made.</p>, <p>For the most part, they've been asking the villagers how they do stuff. Tungstant is over at the forge right at this moment, along with a mind mage, hassling the smiths about their craft.. It started yesterday apparently, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it will continue for a long time to come.</p>, <p>Even Beyn is down there working! The priest is still wearing his now tatty robes and is working with his one remaining arm, clearing rock and jovially encouraging the people around him. Not that they seem to need a pick me up. Ever since I've arrived their faces have been lit with joy and they've been working at a furious pace.</p>, <p>It all leads me to one, sincere conclusion: these people are very sick.</p>, <p>[This is a literal temple to a monster, Enid.]</p>, <p>[To you, Anthony.]</p>, <p>[And what exactly do you think I am?!]</p>, <p>[I'm not sure, why don't you tell me?]</p>, <p>[A monster!]</p>, <p>[Really?]</p>, <p> Find authorized novels in Webnovel，faster updates, better experience，Please click www.webnovel.com for visiting. </p>, <p> [YES!]</p>, <p>[Hmmph. Not like any monster I've ever heard of.]</p>, <p>Gawd. Even Enid has been infected. It's contagious. Do I need to isolate this community? Set up a containment? It would be irresponsible to allow others to be exposed. Or indeed, if the wider world found out that these people were worshipping monsters, would they just get wiped out? Perhaps I need to isolate them for their own protection…</p>, <p>[You haven't sent anyone out of the village at this point, have you Enid?]</p>, <p>She nods decisively.</p>, <p>[Oh yes. There are more survivors out there, I'm sure of it. We also need to get far enough north to check what the damage was like to the neighbouring kingdoms. If they're fine they may be able to send aid. We also want to keep an eye on the main Dungeon entrance where the capital used to stand. Just in case anything comes up. We've had dozens of volunteers ride out, most of them yesterday.]</p>, <p>[Dammit! I was too slow!]</p>, <p>[To what?]</p>, <p>[… Nothing.]</p>, <p>As frustrating as this is, I'm happy to see the ants and humans coexisting in a peaceful, non-eating each other way. It seems as if the council has taken my message of trying to learn from our neighbours and have been pushing forward even more rapidly than I had expected. My shock just goes to show that I've underestimated the colony's appetite for work once again.</p>, <p>The village itself saw remarkably little damage during the assault. The people had wisely set their defences alongside ours, away from the established buildings of the village. As a consequence, the monsters left them alone. Garralosh wanted to destroy the people, she didn't really care for their irrigation system.</p>, <p>As I look across the village, the people seem happy, industrious. Farms are springing up, the houses are starting to get a little more of a permanent vibe to them. Even the kids seem happy.</p>, <p>[Looks like you've come through the crises okay then.] I said to Enid.</p>, <p>[Thanks to you,] she replied.</p>, <p>[Not this again.]</p>, <p>[I'm just being honest. None of us would have survived if not for you. I don't understand why you would be so against humans giving you such respect.]</p>, <p>[This isn't respect. You don't build a temple, to show respect. How can you not think this is weird?! Am I going to lose my cred as a monster over this?]</p>, <p>[I don't follow.]</p>, <p>Haaa. These humans are so tiring. I should get out of here before Beyn tries to speak to me.</p>, <p>[I'll be heading into the Dungeon for a while. Plus it's a lot harder for me to be on the surface now, so you won't see much of me. Maybe this temple situation might blow over if I don't show my face for a bit.]</p>, <p>Enid's snort speaks to what she thinks of that idea.</p>, <p>[Looks like the colony is going to keep hassling you guys for knowledge anyway. If you keep teaching them, I'll make sure that we keep protecting you.]</p>, <p>[Sounds fair,] she observed.</p>, <p>[I need to get out of here.]</p>, <p>I broke the contact with her and turned to walk back to the colony.

            "[<p>In an effort to return to normalcy, I think it's best that I get back to the colony as quickly as possible. With Crinis and Tiny in tow, we make our way out of the village. Before long my thoughts begin to wander toward the Common Will Vestibule. It's powerful, there's no doubt about that. The constant flow of energy that trickles from the gem-like organ and into my system is nourishing in an all-encompassing way. It washes away my fatigue, refills my other glands, heals me and perhaps does other things as well. If it was able to provide me with mana it would be an all-singing, all-dancing provider of everything I could possibly need.</p>, <p>As it is, it's immensely powerful. The only issue I have with it is the strange whispers and thoughts that pop into my head. I'm finding I get an urge to do stuff at random and I have a sneaking suspicion I know what's causing it, and why, and the connotations are a little disturbing to me. I don't intend to set myself up as some sort of king, but the colony feels like it's trending that way at the moment. I'm not sure I like it. I'm really looking forward to breaking out on my own for some Dungeon exploration. Just put some space between the family and myself for a little while and let things settle down. I'll need time to adjust to this new evolution and Tiny and Crinis need to evolve and build their strength if they're to keep up with me.</p>, <p>Before the wave is gone completely, we need to push deep, maybe even try and find the second strata. Do some fighting, level up a few skills, clear the air a little. After all the excitement of the attack by Garralosh, I can't wait to get back to a simpler life.</p>, <p>Muddling along like this, I walk for twenty minutes before I wake up to the fact that I'm nowhere near the nest.</p>, <p>[What the heck?! Where are we?!]</p>, <p>[I - I'm not sure, Master!]</p>, <p>[Hurrn?!] Tiny grunts.</p>, <p>It seems as if we've wandered into the forest. I immediately get suspicious. There's no way I would've gotten lost, I'm an ant! I follow the pheromone trail when I walk. I could walk along the path whilst I was asleep and still manage to get there! Someone has been playing with my mind!</p>, <p>And I can think of one likely suspect…</p>, <p>[Uhh. Hello, Mr Kaarmodo. I hope you've brought me here for a friendly chat. No hard feelings about me killing Garralosh right? Or for murdering your attendants? Uh. Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. I mean, they did try to kill me first. Self-defence is a thing, right?]</p>, <p>I babble within my own mind as I nervously watch the surrounding trees for any sign a large, vengeful lizard is about to charge forward and attempt to bite my head off.</p>, <p>To my chagrin, there is only silence in my mind after my words and I don't see any movement around me. Doubt begins to creep in. Did the Kaarmodo drag me out here just to play funny buggers? Is he just messing with me?</p>, <p>With caution, I turn around to orient myself back to the nest.</p>, <p>[GAH!]</p>, <p>And out of nowhere the Kaarmodo has appeared! Flanked by six of his Setsulah attendants with their hoods down for once, the Lizard Wizard is standing only three metres away! I leap back in shock as Tiny and Crinis move to take an aggressive position, ready to come to my defence.</p>, <p>[What the heck are you doing?! You'll give me a heart attack! You've been there this whole time, haven't you? Playing tricks on me?!]</p>, <p>The Lizard shifts his weight slightly as his eyes stare unblinking into mine. Something tells me that's as close as a Kaarmodo gets to laughing out loud. When I calm myself a little, I take a good look at this manipulator and his attendants. I haven't been able to see them this close before and it's interesting to see them now. The Lizard himself is bedecked in finery. I hesitate to say it, but for a giant lizard, he is rolling in bling. Woven tapestries with gleaming golden thread tassels lay across his back, the colours are rich and deep, purples, greens and yellows that depict mountain scenes and deep caves filled with magic. On each of his legs he wears at least one golden ring and his neck is positively covered in them.</p>, <p>The servants are similarly well dressed. With their hoods back for once I get to see their faces properly for once. I'd thought they would look more human, but they are definitely more than a little part lizard. Their faces are heavily scaled, whilst still maintaining a humanoid shape. Eye colours vary from deep gold to emerald green but each are vertically slit as a reptiles. Golden nose rings, necklaces and torques, each intricately carved and decorated with jewels adorn each and every one of them. Pretty darn flashy for slaves.</p>, <p>[Perhaps I should have made my presence known earlier.] The voice of the Kaarmodo resounds in my mind. Very notably, that was not an apology. [Please be at ease, I have not come to destroy you.]</p>, <p>Ouch. Very aggressive choice of words there.</p>, <p>[So… no hard feelings about the.. Uh… unfortunate loss of your slaves then?]</p>, <p>Why the hell would you remind him of that, Anthony? Not smooth! Opposite of smooth!</p>, <p>A spike of pain jabs into my brain across the mind bridge that I have only just begun to sense, causing my legs to spasm. I let it roll over me, probably well deserved to be honest, as I consider his spell weaving. How the hell he's able to hide them like this I have no idea.</p>, <p>[These are not my slaves, and you are lucky that they did not hear you describe them as such. They are bonded to me, and I am bonded to them. Our relationship is one of mutual respect and dependence.]</p>, <p>[Okay. Sure.] I shrugged my antennae. [Doesn't really matter to me. Since you brought me out here, without the intention to annihilate my atoms, what exactly would you like to say?]</p>, <p>I don't feel particularly comfortable talking to this ancient wizard. The sooner he lets me get on my way, the happier I'll be.</p>, <p>[There is no need to rush, young one.

The smoking ashes of what was once the kingdom of Liria? The uncivilised wilds? I'm not sure what you mean.]</p>, <p>The Kaarmodo shifts his legs slightly which causes his attendants to glance at him for a moment.

            "[<p>Enid Ruther couldn't decide if she was more tired or invigorated. The council meeting had run late, again, until even Bertold the guild leader had been nodding in his cup. And yet not a single member would say they'd left the gathering anything less than upbeat. Perhaps it was true what her husband used to say and people truly did see the best of each other in the darkest of times. Unlike Derrion, she'd never been forced to confront those dark moments battling in the Dungeon, instead she got to see the best her people could offer now, after their homes and families had been destroyed in such a brutal manner.</p>, <p>To juxtapose such suffering with the incredible community that had sprung up in the middle of nowhere was at times completely jarring, yet unless she was thinking of it consciously it all just felt so natural. Of course the Gorion family would lend their meagre spare supplies to the Tirin's who'd just arrived with nothing but the clothes on their back, why would anyone ever think that they wouldn't?! Or that the builders would happily shove away their dinner and start levelling ground and cutting beams the second Enid knocked on their door and said new houses where needed. She didn't say they were needed immediately and hastened to tell them so but they just shrugged, grinned and got to work.</p>, <p>She'd never seen such an unselfish work ethic in all her life and every day she woke up expecting to find it gone and replaced with more normal greed, but it clung to the community like a stubborn virus. By now even the neighbours were starting to notice the unflinching generosity and dedication of the people, Enid herself had been questioned on it more than once.</p>, <p>[No,] she'd been forced to say, [it isn't normal for people to work like this.]</p>, <p>[Curious,] the ant had stared up at her with its unblinking eyes as it pondered her words, [you wouldn't describe humans as… lazy … would you?]</p>, <p>The insects were normally almost totally void of emotion, but somehow she could sense just how repellent the concept of laziness was to the creature. Which made sense, she supposed, ants were not exactly known for being relaxed and slack creatures.</p>, <p>[Humans can be lazy,] she admitted, [just like any other creature…]</p>, <p>The ant stared at her for a long moment.</p>, <p>[… almost any other creature, I meant to say. Obviously the Colony is excepted from such… weak… fleshy concerns.]</p>, <p>She swore the ant's antennae wiggled a little at her acknowledgement. Thinking back to that conversation caused a slight chuckle to break through the old woman's gruff exterior as she walked through the cool night. In some ways the insects of Anthony's colony were highly intelligent and curious creatures, full of questions and full of an insatiable thirst to learn. In other ways they were like children, incapable of deception and completely certain of their own point of view. Would the monsters become old and jaded, as so many mortal species did? Or would they continue forward forever sure in themselves?</p>, <p>Needless to say, Enid wouldn't live long enough to find out. It was a miracle she was still going, all things considered. At nearly seventy years of age, she was easily the oldest survivor of the disaster. Which was surprising since she'd not gained a whole lot of toughness across her lifetime. Perhaps it was Will keeping her old bones moving?</p>, <p>She rapped at the door of the bowyer and pushed her way in without waiting for a response. A rush of warm air blew past as she stepped blinking into the newly made workspace. Wood chips and shavings covered every surface and the air felt thick with it, causing her to cough as she waved a hand in front of her. What she didn't see was her damn craftsman.</p>, <p>\"Aarran Yewman! Where the hell are you? I told you I'd be here after the meeting!\"</p>, <p>From another room came the scraping of a chair across the floor and the overweight, balding bowmaker stumbled into the room.</p>, <p>\"Keep it down Enid, you old crow!\" He growled in his low, rumbling, voice. \"I just sat down to eat my dinner, I've been waiting around out here for more than an hour.\"</p>, <p>\"Hardly my fault if the meeting runs long, is it?\" Enid re-joined. \"Have you taken a look at it yet or have you been slacking?\"</p>, <p>Mumbling to himself about the apology Aarran knew he was never going to get, he limped across the room to his work bench and reached up to pull down a long stave of wood from an overhead rack.</p>, <p>\"Slacking? Unlike some people who sit around all day and call it work, I've been busy. Take a look at this.\"</p>, <p>So saying he tossed the stave toward Enid, forcing her to catch it out of the air with a squawk. The moment she had it in her hands though, her eyes sharpened and her merchant’s instincts took over. The wood was smooth, the grain fine. The flex was perfect as well. She brought it closer to her eyes and noted with excitement the slight gleam that ran through the wood.</p>, <p>\"This is good stuff.\"</p>, <p>\"Aye. That it is,\" Aarran agreed. \"Those ants have some good stuff in their mandibles there, I'd have worked with wood of that quality probably three or four times in my entire life, and I've been cutting bows since I was five.\"</p>, <p>A recent addition to Renewal Village, Aarran was a master Bowyer from a kingdom neighbouring Liria, Holt. It seems that before she came south the hated Garralosh wasn’t too concerned if she crossed borders and her monsters had rampaged through many of the border kingdoms. The outriders had ranged far and fast to bring word of this refuge to everyone who could make it and even now more people were flooding in, seemingly by the day. Enid had finally started delegating as much as she needed to and for now things were holding together.</p>, <p>\"What sort of enchantment do you think the wood will hold?\" She asked.</p>, <p>She had her own opinion but Aarran would know better than her. This was his particular area of expertise, after all.</p>, <p>\"Just about any basic enchantment of Earth, Water or Wood affinity I would think. Ice arrows would be a good one, but there's a heap of options. Problem is, I can't do the enchanting myself. Have you lined up anyone to do it for you?\"</p>, <p>His tone said that he was doubtful she'd managed that. Several craftsmen were working hard to develop their enchanting skills but none were far enough along that she'd be willing to let them work on such precious material as this.</p>, <p>\"Well, that's the thing. I think I have found someone to perform the enchanting, but they need to practice first. I've been asked to provide some practice staves for them to work on. Do you think you could supply them?\"</p>, <p>\"Well, sure.\" Aarran folded his arms. \"How many do they want?\"</p>, <p>\"A thousand…\"</p>, <p>\"A THOUSAND? Where the hell do you think I'm going to find the time to make that many?! And who could possibly have a thousand cores to spare making practice bows?!\" The irate bowyer stared at her as if she were daft, which was fair.</p>, <p>Enid sighed. She knew this would happen.</p>, <p>\"I know you've only been here a few days, Aarran, and I appreciate everything you've been able to for us…\"</p>, <p>\"Aye.\"</p>, <p>\"… did you happen to talk to Priest Beyn yesterday?\"</p>, <p>\"… Aye.\"</p>, <p>\"And what did you think? About what he had to say.\"</p>, <p>The big man hesitated for a moment.</p>, <p>\"It's… hard to take.\"</p>, <p>Enid nodded.</p>, <p>\"I know. By all that is holy, I know. But it's all true. You've seen them around, you know the Colony means us no harm. More than that, they have acted out to help us in a huge number of ways. This is one of them. They've offered to perform the enchanting for us.\"</p>, <p>The craftsman's eyes widened to an almost dangerous degree.</p>, <p>\"The ants?! Enchanting? In return for what?\"</p>, <p>\"That's the thing. They just want the experience and Skill levels. Apparently they've been enchanting like crazy down there. Unlike us, they have the resources to burn testing and experimenting and they are actually getting somewhere!\"</p>, <p>\"There has to be a price, Enid.\" Aarran rebuffed her, not willing to trust monsters. \"What could they possibly want.\"</p>, <p>\"Knowledge. Before he left, Anth- … Their leader told me that the ants would help us in return for access to our knowledge. If they ask a question, make sure you answer it, that's all.\"</p>, <p>The old man nodded slowly.</p>, <p>\"And what happens when we have no more knowledge to give?\" He asked. \"Do they abandon us? Or worse? I spoke to Beyn and I've been in that church he built. It ain’t natural, Enid. Quite a few newcomers are nervous about it. People are worried that we trust these monsters too much.\"</p>, <p>Enid sighed. This was a recurring issue that cropped up with every new group of refugees who settled here. After some time, they would acclimate, or more likely, Beyn would talk them around to his way of thinking. But then another group would come and the whisperings would start all over again. It just felt like each time it happened it took longer from the rumblings to settle down. Some people just flat refused to believe that an ant brought down Garralosh and saved them from the horde. Enid didn't even blame them, it seemed crazy. Perhaps if Anthony was here then it would be easier to convince them. Things just seemed to happen when that creature was around.</p>, <p>\"Just think about it,\" Enid told him. \"I have assurances that they can do what we want. I'd rather not have to order you Aarran, but we need to make the most of this. These weapons will not only make us safe, they'll secure us financially. For years. If you agree, then deliver whatever you can to Beyn in the morning and start working on the rest.\"</p>, <p>Not bothering to stay and argue, Enid turned and left. It was late and she was cold. Her own blankets awaited.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Beyn Antseeker, for that was now his name, tread forward with reverence. This was a sacred place, and one toward which he felt only the deepest respect. They were all around him now and he did his best not to disturb their paths and they moved passed him with purpose. They were always so sure of themselves, the Path was clear before their multi-faceted eyes and their many legs could not stray from it.</p>, <p>[Hurry your step, human. There is much work to be done.]</p>, <p>Ah!</p>, <p>[I apologise, holy one. I was distracted, also it is difficult for me to carry these with only one arm.]</p>, <p>It was true. Currently, Beyn was carrying an arm load of ten unstrung bow staves in a delivery to the Colony under his one good arm. There had been tremendous excitement amongst the faithful when the offer of the Colony to enchant weapons for the Village. Such a thing was yet more evidence of the righteousness of their cause. How could anyone continue to hold doubts as to the nature of this Colony, to the sanctity of the Great One? Such an offer only put more fuel on the fires of faith and Beyn had immediately held a public gathering to preach in the Village square, praising this news to the heavens.</p>, <p>Enid had been quite annoyed with him at that. Considering the transaction hadn't been finalised and the craftsmen in particular had not yet agreed to take part. Beyn had scoffed at such meagre constraints. Such things would be swept away by the current of destiny that had seized them all in its waves!</p>, <p>She'd hit him after that and he had executed a tactical retreat. It was frustrating to Beyn that none were closer to the ants, or the Great One in the village than Enid was, yet she held herself back from truly embracing the new Path. She'd never been particularly religious and Beyn had many disagreements with her acting as her Priest, yet he believed that deep down the faith burned strong within her.</p>, <p>How could it not? She had witnessed the miracles of the Colony from just as close as he had!</p>, <p>[Are you sure that I shouldn't carry them for you?] His escort flexed her mandibles to demonstrate their willingness to help.</p>, <p>[I must decline,] Beyn hastened to say. [The agreement stated that we must deliver the material to you directly and I do not intend to shirk my work.]</p>, <p>[That's good then.] The ant nodded its antennae and continued to lead the way toward the nest.</p>, <p>Even though this particular Mage had no idea why the council had agreed to let this human inside the nest she would do her job and escort them properly. If he so much as looked at a brood chamber he was getting chomped.</p>, <p>The Priest was quite aware that he was in danger. He knew a great deal about the Colony, more than the ants suspected in all likelihood. He couldn't help it, he was endlessly curious about this manifestation of a miracle, as were his followers. Once the ants had begun to interact with the people of Village in an attempt to learn what they knew of production, construction and civilisation, the faithful had begun an earnest campaign to learn about them. There was nothing malicious in their hearts, they simply yearned to grow closer, to learn anything they could about the object of their reverence.</p>, <p>And so when they were approached by the Colony to share they knowledge, they did so gladly and when they felt they could, they politely, respectfully and tactfully asked questions back. Most of the time the ants would refuse to answer. They didn't seem to particularly trust humans and were, quite naturally, very insular. It was to expected, after all. Divine monsters they may be, but the nature of the Colony was to be loyal to itself. Even so, every drab of information was hoarded, analysed and ruminated on. Every utterance of an ant was taken as holy gospel, to be studied and dissected.</p>, <p>In this way, tiny tidbits of information were accrued in order to paint a picture. A blurry picture, with giant gaps. But a picture nonetheless. For instance, they learned that it was the will of the Great One that directed the Colony to interact so closely with the Village. They also learned that the Colony was actively making use of their newfound knowledge as much as possible. Enchanting, forging, building. Every day the ants would come back with more detailed questions, as if they'd taken what they'd learned that day, tried to apply it through the night, then come back for more insights.</p>, <p>But the holy grail, the most coveted prize of all, besides further words with the Great One, was to have access to the nest. They craved it! Oh how they craved it! Even though he knew it was a pipe-dream. As if the ants would ever let them inside their most precious abode! If there was ever to be a chance, it would be through the strengthening bonds of cooperation between the two communities. This exchange had provided an in and Beyn Antseeker was determined to seek with all his strength!</p>, <p>[Hold up there, human Beyn.] He was warned by his escort and he stopped.</p>, <p>After a few moments of silence another, larger ant emerged from the ground to his right. He started. He hadn't even noticed the opening in the ground and yet now a monster had just sprung from it.</p>, <p>[Greetings, human Beyn.] Came another voice. [My name is Cobalt. Please follow me.]</p>, <p>A name?! A named ant?! They'd heard whispers of this select group of individuals but there had been precious little information about them.</p>, <p>The ant… Cobalt… turned around and vanished once more beneath the ground, leaving the wary Priest little choice but to follow. It was awkward, he was unbalanced due to carrying his cargo under his one arm and the low ceiling, clearly not made for creatures of his height, forced him to stoop.</p>, <p>But he persevered. Indeed, his heart was alight with joy! He would gladly walk over hot coals in order to get even a glimpse into the inner sanctum of these holy creatures! As he shuffled through the tunnels, it was clear that he wasn't being shown anything the ants were not prepared to allow him to see. He saw no young, no sign of the Queen that had been sighted during the battle against Garralosh. Instead he saw something even more shocking. Chamber after chamber that had been shaped and purposed for crafting. Forges, complete with stone floors, magically operated bellows and ventilation. Enchanting chambers filled with cores and decorated with special, ant comfortable stations in which the creatures could work.</p>, <p>[Your weapons will be enchanted here,] Cobalt finally stopped and indicated a particular chamber with his antennae. [Please leave the staves and bring another load at this time tomorrow. We are confident we will have worked out the process after a week, maybe two.]</p>, <p>Not daring to speak, Beyn lay down his burden and bowed deeply towards every ant he could see before he was escorted out. Though his face was calm, his heart burned with renewed fervour. He hadn't dared to imagine they could come this far. What could they be but divine?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>There's been a notable increase in spectators between rounds. When I had my first fight there was hardly anyone about to watch the spectacle but now, here in round four? Someone's getting popular! The observation area is packed.. Standing room only. It makes sense in a morbid way. One hundred and twenty eight triads had an entrant in this tournament and now only sixteen were still working. All those idle hands means more stone layered bums in seats I suppose. Not to mention all of the triads who manage the surviving monsters are here to scout. When there's only eight fights, it's not hard to make it to all of them and keep an eye on the opposition.</p>, <p>With this bumper audience I'll need to ensure I put on a show!</p>, <p>No wait… Why the hell would I do that? Just focus on not getting dead and surviving long enough to escape! Don't do anything unnecessary, idiot! Trying to snap back into focus I shake off the surprise I felt at the size of the crowd and worry about what's in front of me. The gate hasn't risen to let my opponent in yet, so I still have some time. Best get myself fully prepared. Sink into the meditation skill, get my sub-brains prepping some mana. Our intel spoke to the speed and dexterity of this opponent, so we decided a Gravity mana focused strategy would help even the odds. I've also whipped up a Fire mana construct just in case. The wide range of the flame thrower spell and general explodiness should help catch out my more nimble opponent.</p>, <p>Oh ho! Here we go. I stretch out my six legs as the gate opposite begins to rattle as it rises to reveal the creature behind it. It looks… just as weird as I was told. It's tall, probably as tall as Tiny, but thin, like, really thin. It looks like it hasn't eaten anything in its entire life! Emaciated is one thing, but this guy is pushing it to a new level. He kind of looks like a shadow beast was crossed with a sloth. He has gangly arms tipped with long, curved claws that cast a wicked gleam. In fact, I suspect they are actually glowing, though it's hard to tell in this lighting. Could be an elemental mutation, or perhaps a mana infusion that aids cutting power? Could be something new they added to help deal with my carapace. The creature has a narrow face with a particularly non-threatening mole-like pointy face. Something tells me the teeth he's packing in there are the real deal though.</p>, <p>As it strolls into the arena the creature stretches its limbs languorously in a nonchalant display. Considering those limbs are made from shadow flesh those stretches are a little disturbing, the limbs bending too far to be normal, the flesh extending far more than it should.</p>, <p>Alright there, buddy. No need to put yourself on display. Oh look, the Shapers are eating it up. Chumps. So much pointing and muttering going on up there. Get with the program guys, where's the ant love? I can't help but clack my mandibles in irritation. Stupid sloth monster, stealing my limelight. I'll get my revenge by eating him, I suppose that'll have to do. One final check of my skills and constructs. Everything looks good. Time to start weaving and compressing my first spell.</p>, <p>As my sub-brains get busy focusing on casting, I watch the opponent like an ant-hawk. The biggest threat this monster poses is his insane speed and lightning fast attacks. No elemental damage, no magic or super fancy tricks. Granin speculated that the triad who created this beast designed it to make best use out of its rubbery, shadow flesh by creating a beast that could push its body past breaking point, literally shred its own tissues to achieve speed and power that would otherwise be impossible. The unique properties of shadow flesh means that the monster can regrow and replace the damage far more easily than I can heal. Even Crinis utilises similar mutations that allow her to just 'pump' more shadow goop into damaged areas to replace what's been lost.</p>, <p>It makes for an intimidating prospect. I'll need to be careful. Well… of course I do, it's a fight to the death.</p>, <p>I know the battle is going to start in a few seconds so I waste no time unleashing my first spell before the Shapers declare the fight has begun. It's a defensive spell which is apparently allowed. Before my opponent can move a muscle my Gravity Domain expands outwards in an ever revolving sphere centred on me. I'm not actually sure if the spell penetrates through the ground… I might need to investigate that.</p>, <p>In a loud voice, the Shaper announces the start of the battle and I nearly flinch even sunk into meditation, my mind hyper-alert and focusing on my foe. I'm not sure what I expected to happen. I think deep down I imagined him disappearing like a cartoon character, only to appear behind me looking smug whilst I appear foolish and confused. Not that such a thing would work on me anyway, I can see behind me! MUAHAHAHA.</p>, <p>No, instead the monster continues its casual behaviour and strolls toward me, it's movements languid and relaxed. I don't know if this guy is overconfident or if this is how he always acts. Oh well, no reason not to execute the plan. With my condensed Gravity Domain slowly revolving around me I engage my brains again and draw out more Gravity mana to shape into spells. Thank goodness my Gravity Mana Gland contains so much of the precious juice. Granin and I theorised that it would be a key element in slowing my speedy opponent down. My first attempt is gravity spear, the old favourite.</p>, <p>I settle my feet and try to get low. No point trying to contest this creature in speed, I have no hope of winning such a contest and running around is only going to open up blind spots. Instead, I'll force him to come to me and act like the mountain against his wind.</p>, <p>As the monster draws closer I snap my mandibles open and unleash the spear in a straight line directly into the creature’s face. See if you can act smug now! Contrary to my expectations however, the creature casually leans to one side and allows the spear to brush past its lithe frame. Damn thing barely broke stride!</p>, <p>That spell moves pretty damn fast. Not like, a bullet fast, we aren't talking Neo levels of dodge here, but still, fast. It felt like he just swayed out of the way of an arrow I'd fired at his face. Maybe if I aim lower, go for the middle of his body, then he'll have to at least move a little more.</p>, <p>Drawing on the combined power of my two weaker sub-brains I throw together another spear and cast it as fast as I can. By this time the monster is within thirty metres of me, having walked his way straight toward me from the other side of the arena. The moment the spear is unleashed I raise up my profit margin and unleash a barrage of acid.</p>, <p>POW! POW! POW! POW!</p>, <p>The spell streaks forward whilst overhead the acid arcs into the air before spreading and starting to fall. I tried to arrange the four shots in a spread around the monster's current location. Let's see how you dodge now…</p>, <p>Almost as if in slow motion, the monster's eyes sharpen and it bends its legs. Then, with a flicker of light, it's gone!</p>, <p>WHAM!</p>, <p>A tremendous impact slams into my side, but I'm ready! My legs absorb the shock and I angle my carapace to allow those long, curved claws to slide off my side with a screech. My mandibles open wide and snap shut in an instant but the creature is already gone. With a kick of his legs he pushes off the ground and almost glides through the air to land more than ten metres away.</p>, <p>So fast! So damn fast! Without my enhanced reflexes and future sense, I'd have had no idea what had even hit me! That's how every fight has gone so far for this monster apparently. One hit kills. Even then, he aimed for my eye, the gap in my defences. I had to perform a tiny dash to bring my head out from under that strike and have it clash on my carapace instead.</p>, <p>Now he's just standing outside the range of my Domain looking at me with his head cocked, as if he's shocked I'm still alive. This monster is irritating in the extreme.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>This cocky monster is going to catch these mandibles, just as soon as I manage to get a hook on him. The strange thing is how he was able to enter and exit my gravity domain so easily… Is it a question of mass? True, he's thin as an anorexic stick on an Atkins diet, but I'd assumed that he'd be dense, like Crinis. That shadow flesh can be packed pretty darn tight. I'm starting to suspect that they may not have done that in order to avoid hampering his speed. Which means that gravity magic may not be the answer to my problems. Or perhaps it still is? I may just need to think outside the box. Regardless, I still have tricks I haven't shown off that I can use.</p>, <p>I take a moment to check on the damage to my carapace whilst my opponent is still pondering the meaning of my continuing existence. Looks like he managed to gouge a chunk out of my beautiful diamond skeleton. I shouldn't be surprised considering the strength behind that blow. If my carapace was any weaker he might have blown a hole right through it. As it stands the damage is already being repaired by the inner-plating below, the grooves left behind from the claws are filling up with a clear gel-like fluid that will soon harden into new carapace. It'll take a lot more than this to break down my defence!</p>, <p>Carapace is love! Carapace is life! Diamonds are forever! Gweheheheh.</p>, <p>Trying to catch the monster unawares, I blast off a quick Gravity Spear but to no avail. With another seemingly casual movement, the monster is able to step to one side and avoid the spell, which fizzles into the ground behind him. He must have very high levels of the Dodge Skill, possibly even precognitive abilities similar to my own. He just makes dodging look so easy. That slight movement seems to have been the signal for him to start back up again. The monster leans to one side and begins to walk, rapidly picking up pace until he's sprinting at an insane speed, looping around me in a circle. Sand flies up in a curtain, thrown into the air by the creature’s feet as I wonder what he's trying to achieve. I can't get dizzy, bud. I don't have to turn my head to keep my eyes on you…</p>, <p>He is staying out of the range of my Gravity Domain though, which is worth noting.</p>, <p>Not willing to wait for the enemy to make the first move, I draw out my fire mana and weave together a particularly nasty spell. The monster is moving almost too quickly for me to get a solid lock on it, but that shouldn’t matter for this spell. It only takes seconds for me to piece together the lines of magic and power them. Within moments my mandibles open wide and a sizzling hose of flame erupts from in front of my face! Burn, sucka!</p>, <p>A hiss of pain reaches my ears before my antennae tingle once again. Acting on instinct, my nerves fire at once and my body twitches to one side.</p>, <p>BAM!</p>, <p>Another sharp impact! Once again the beast was trying to stuff its claws straight through my eyes and into my head! Nasty! My shift was enough to cause the strike to fall on another part of my head, no major harm done. I don't turn off the flames and keep pouring more mana into it. I've now got two spells of different Affinities going at once, quite a difficult feat. Without the training I've received lately, this would be far more difficult. My brains are truly flexing their power now!</p>, <p>My carapace starts to warm up as I spin in place and blast my surroundings with blazing flames. The sand sounds as if it's cooking and begins to glow a bright red as the creature leaps left and right, trying to avoid the heat. Too hot for you, mole face? I've got plenty more where this came from! The torrent of fire continues to pour out from in front of my face as my minds strain to control the flood of mana powering the Spell. I angle my body left and right but the opponent is just too slippery, unleashing a hiss of rage before nimbly dodging away, jumping over or ducking beneath the Spell and sprinting to find another angle to approach.</p>, <p>Whilst I keep the fire magic flowing, the monster is hesitant to approach and seems content to wait me out. Unwilling to allow my mana reserves to fall too low, I reluctantly let the spell drop and start watching my enemy closely. The fire magic was effective and I know for sure I scored a hit. That might not mean much, considering the creature is known to have powerful regenerative abilities, but I'll take the minor victory.</p>, <p>In fact, so far this match is going fairly well. I might not be able to put damage onto the monster in front of me, but he hasn't been able to do much to me either. All in all, I'm feeling pretty safe! Wait, don't think that, Anthony. That's a flag right there.</p>, <p>No sooner do I think that thought than the monster opposite seems to come to the same conclusion. His current tactics aren't working and right now it's going to be a race to see if I'll run out of Mana before he runs out of Stamina. Considering how draining it must be to move at that kind of speed, I can't see me losing that race. In other words, the monster and I appear to decide simultaneously that it's time to take this fight to the next level.</p>, <p>The monster's eyes flicker and it leaps away from me. Once it lands, the beast opens its strange, pointed mouth and screams, before its entire body begins to turn red, as if the blood within its veins has boiled in an instant.</p>, <p>Is this your secret powerup moment? Are you about to unleash your final technique?! I don't think so!</p>, <p>Unwilling to let the monster have any time to itself, I flood my mandibles with Gravity Mana and prepare to unveil my next trick. With a mental shout of 'GET OVER HERE', I YOINK the creature with a powerful pull and it's light mass causes it to fall directly toward me. I can see the shock in its eyes as the ground no longer feels like the ground and it falls directly toward the eager jaws of its foe. But it's not the face hands I want my enemy to catch, but a bit of heat.</p>, <p>As the creature falls toward me, my mandibles open wide and fire boils out from before my face, submitting my enemy to a glorious roast, one which it doesn't appreciate judging by the horrific screech of pain it emits.</p>, <p>Then it completes its journey and slams into my head, clawing and biting like a mad thing having a bad day. As soon as it latches its hands onto me the beast pulls itself away from my head and starts to go to town on my back with a flurry of enraged strikes.</p>, <p>BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!</p>, <p>With horrific, unimaginable strength far beyond what I have felt before from this thing it batters away at my carapace with its elongated, curved claws, tearing chunks out my diamond shell with every strike. What's more, I can see that the creature’s own body falling apart with every movement. Ichor begins to burst out of its limbs and drip down onto my exo-skeleton where it sizzles and steams.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Once again, I've managed to pile up a respectable amount of Biomass, though far less than I could have. The priority was given to pumping up those around me on recent trips, on the next one I can afford to be more… dare I say it… selfish. It's not selfish to feed myself dammit! I need to max out my mutations before I can even think about evolving. Anyone who thinks I'm going to miss out on that juicy, free bonus evolutionary energy for maxed evolutions is insane! Insane I tell you!</p>, <p>To that end, I need to stuff my face. I won't apologise for it!</p>, <p>The other thing I need to do is use combat to pump up my Skills as fast as possible. Elemental magic needs to be the priority. Once I finally achieve the rank five fusion, I'll be able to finally push my practice in other directions. Mind magic will probably be the next area of magical study I need to push.

I guess in the back of my mind I'd kind of pushed all thought of evolution away since level eighty was such a ridiculously long way away. Not anymore though! Only twenty nine more levels! Sounds like a lot, but it's a heck of a lot less than eighty!</p>, <p>I'm getting excited just thinking about it. Evolution is so addictive, I swear.</p>, <p>Alright, let's get busy, if I sit around here and keep pondering my next evolution then nothing is going to get done. Leaving my pets to sort out their own numbers (even Tiny appears to be counting on his fingers, his face a mask of concentration), I duck out into the corridor and flag down a passing ant.</p>, <p>\"Hey there, any chance you can get word to the golgari Torrina and Corun to come and drop by here?\"</p>, <p>\"Sure thing. Work hard!\"</p>, <p>\"When am I not?\"</p>, <p>\"…\"</p>, <p>\"Alright already! Geez!\"</p>, <p>Everyone's a critic. Just because I'm not currently doing something, doesn't mean I'm not <em>doing something</em>. Sort of. I quickly brush up on the Skills that I've upgraded recently whilst I wait for my two advisors to arrive.</p>, <p>Flicker Dash ranking up into Snap Dash was a nice one. The improved dash skill has a dramatically shorter wind up than before. Not that the charging time was long, but if you cut half a second down to a quarter of a second, you notice. It's similar to the feeling of gathering strength in your legs before you jump. With flicker dash, there was a brief moment of wind up before the explosive speed was unleashed, now that time is almost gone. Combined with my reflexes, even faster dodging is now possible. Gweheheheh.</p>, <p>My digging Skill has once more ranked up, Master Excavation taking my ability to move serious dirt to a whole new level. The pursuit of ant zen will never stop! Meditation ranked up once again, which is handy. The Skill is basically a form of enhanced concentration, allowing the Skill user to push emotion and distractions to one side and draw out 100% of their strength. This new rank improves the ability of the Skill to be utilised when moving in high speed, stressful situations. Allowing me to stay centered and focused, even when dashing all over the place.</p>, <p>Directed mana sensing is a handy one, essentially allowing me to extend my sensing range by focusing on a particular direction, like focusing a beam of concentration. Ranking up grace is just helping me with my balance, never a thing to be underestimated when you can run up multiple surfaces and have six legs. All in all, my progress has been decent without being overwhelming. My strength has been steadily ticking up, without any major leaps.</p>, <p>That has to change! MOAR power will be needed if I'm going to defend the Colony and fight off the invaders! It's unlikely I'll manage to evolve before the golgari arrive, but I can push my Skills as far as possible before then and see what happens.</p>, <p>Ten minutes later my advisors arrive and I welcome them into my chamber.</p>, <p>[Wait, this is where you live?] Corun asks, blank faced.</p>, <p>[Sort of, I suppose? I don't really <em>live</em> anywhere. This is just the chamber we use to sleep and plan. Does any ant really have a place where they <em>live? </em>I mean, we live in the nest, right?]</p>, <p>[I suppose,] he looks at the bare, smooth walls. [You were a human though, once upon a time. I guess I would have expected you to have more of a need for a personal space?]</p>, <p>I'm a bit confused.</p>, <p>[I have my own room,] I point out, [how many ants in the Colony have their own room? It's more than enough.]</p>, <p>Corun looks like he wants to say more but Torrina cuts him off ruthlessly.</p>, <p>[Who cares about this!? What did you want to talk to us about?]</p>, <p>I shrug.</p>, <p>[I was planning on purchasing some mutations and doing some serious power levelling over the next few days, so I thought I'd consult my resident experts? Isn't that what you wanted?]</p>, <p>She nods.</p>, <p>[It is. Although I kind of feel like you're doing this out of courtesy rather than because you feel any real desire for our help. Regardless, I'm happy to discuss your plans. Are you still aiming for the rank five elemental fusion?]</p>, <p>[Yep,] I confirm, [I'm getting close, too. Fire magic is already there. The others are getting closer by the day.]</p>, <p>Corun shakes his head.</p>, <p>[Rank five? I mean… why though?]</p>, <p>Torrina rolls her eyes at him.</p>, <p>[Still, Corun? He made up his mind, leave it alone.]</p>, <p>[Nobody goes for tier five,] he protests, [that's so many Skill levels for such basic magic!]</p>, <p>[But it synergises well with my current build,] I tell him firmly, [I've split my mental power across too many brains to be able to handle the more powerful magics. With this fusion, I'll be able to maximise the offensive output I can achieve from my sub-brain setup.]</p>, <p>He blinks.</p>, <p>[That sounds like a lot more sense than I'm used to hearing from you, Anthony.]</p>, <p>[I'm trying to get better at being assertive. I think it's working?]</p>, <p>[It's working fine,] Torrina assures me, [and I agree with your choices. If you continue to progress and rank up your other core Skills, your bite, movement and defensive ones mainly, then you shouldn't have any issues up until it's time to evolve. Just make sure you consult with us before you do it.]</p>, <p>[Why?]</p>, <p>[I presume you mean to absorb <em>that</em> core, before you do?]</p>, <p>That core, Garralosh's, is buried in the wall next to where I'm standing as a matter of fact. Old habits die hard and stashing cores in my own chamber has worked for me so far.</p>, <p>[Yep.]</p>, <p>[Tier five to tier six is a big evolution for a monster,] she tells me seriously, [not that any evolution is unimportant, but the jump in evolutionary energy available at this tier is huge, and you'll be sitting at tier six for a long time. One hundred and sixty levels takes a long time to get, even if you're being fed by others.]</p>, <p>[As if the Colony would stand it if I made them all force feed me experience,] I laugh, [that's a totally shameful level of laziness.]</p>, <p>She shrugs.</p>, <p>[I think they'd only be too happy to do it, and it might not be the wrong call. You can do a lot of work at tier six. At that tier, normal delvers would need to dispatch several teams of experts to beat such a monster. Even elites in the second strata wouldn't dare go one on one with a tier six. At tier seven? That's basically as powerful as it gets up here. Though, you wouldn't be able to remain at this depth for long, you'd be a powerful deterrent to attackers.]</p>, <p>I hesitate. Would it really be okay to have the Colony feed me experience? Bring already crippled monsters up to me to last hit like they do for the Queens?</p>, <p>[No,] I say, [it feels wrong. Besides, the Queens need that sort of treatment because they have important work to do in the nests and can't be risked. The regular members of the Colony need experience and Biomass also. I'm perfectly capable of getting my own and not stealing from their plate. Every ant is part of strength, not just me.]</p>, <p>She watches me carefully.</p>, <p>[It's your call,] she says, [I won't tell you what to do, ever. All I will do is present ideas.]</p>, <p>[That one's out,] I say.</p>, <p>[Have you considered what path you'll take for the rest of your mutations?] Corun asks.</p>, <p>I consider for a moment.</p>, <p>[I'm not sure exactly where I want to go. I have a few thoughts,] I hedge, [but I don't know what to do that'll best suit a monster like me.]</p>, <p>[I'm not surprised,] Corun chuckles, [there hasn't really <em>been</em> a monster like you. High tier ants are basically unheard of outside of the founding Queen. Quantity and not quality are the usual way the ants like to play. You're a bit unique in that sense.]</p>, <p>[So you don't know of any sweet combos I can use?] I ask, a touch disappointed.</p>, <p>[That's not exactly true,] he muses, [there's tons of research done on other insect archetypes, just not ants. Some of it should apply though.]</p>, <p>[We studied what we could before we left,] Torrina assures me, [and we brought some documents with us, I'd love to go through them with you.]</p>, <p>She starts to rummage through a document satchel strapped to her side and I begin to feel a headache coming on. I didn't realise there'd be book learning! How long does she want to take?</p>, <p>[Look,] I break in, [I'll take a look at the options and sort something out and then we can go through the more advanced stuff together later? Ok?]</p>, <p>Torrina frowns at me doubtfully, which is hard to notice on a golgari what with the stone skin.</p>, <p>[They're your mutations,] she tells me, [you can do what you want. Just try to make sure that you always build on what you already have. Even weaker mutations that have lost their usefulness can fold into a new plan.]</p>, <p>[Think about it carefully, Anthony,] Corun urges me, [next time we'll give you the full rundown, alright? Your sixth tier is going to be fearsome, I guarantee it.]</p>, <p>[Alright, thanks, I appreciate it. If there's nothing else. I'll get to itching.]</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Time to bring on the exquisite pain of self-improvement. I have a ton of Biomass to spend and the time to roll around on the floor looking like a fool. Let's get to it!</p>, <p>But what to improve next? I've still got a ton of things that need to be upgraded to +25. Improving my eyes is an option that leaps out at me. My initial struggle on Pangera was my pathetic ant eyesight, and while getting it to +20 along with a few choice mutations has certainly helped alleviate the situation, it's still not exactly where I'd like it to be. Having said that though, improving my eyeballs isn't going to do a whole lot for me in this strata. This place has two main features, being dark as heck and being cold as a tomb. Eyes may not be the play.</p>, <p>My Gravity magic gland is a touch neglected, I could bring that up to speed, but again, my focus is in other directions at the moment. If I lean on my gravity magic gland too hard then I'll only be slowing the progress of my elemental Skills. Perhaps I can better spend my points elsewhere.</p>, <p>The more I peruse my list of options, the more I'm drawn to the business district. There's a lot of potential upgrades available there, and the number of organs could potentially allow me to build some synergy between them, to further improve the potency of my corporate sector.</p>, <p>The three new additions were the acid nozzle, which gives me more flexible aim, the acid concentration gland, for thickening the acid, and the stimulation gland, which speed up the process of reloading. So far, most of my mutations have concentrated on improving the organs at doing their core job, but I feel like I want to be a little more creative this time.</p>, <p>Eager to check out the possibilities, I dive right in and start poking through the more off beat options in the menu. First, I take a look at the nozzle. The pressurised tube helps to throttle the produce as it emerges, acting like someone squeezing the end of a hose to increase the range. It's done good work, but I'm satisfied with the range, time to see if we can add a little heat, a little spice, to this aspect of the zone.</p>, <p>The list is exhaustively long, all sorts of things strike my eye. For such a small gland, it's quite versatile. Many of the options allow it to place some sort of effect on the nature of the spray. Widen the acid blast, fire the acid a flatter arc, as well as more generic options that improve the ability of the nozzle to flex, broadening its ability to effect aim. I'm not interested in that ordinary stuff. Give me the sauce, Gandalf! I want something a little off the wall!</p>, <p>As I ponder the list, I try to think about what I want my acid to do in a fight. The sticky effect has done good work for me in the past, it was key in slowing down my opponents, restricting them and allowing my former squishy self to stay safe. But now things are different, the stickiness just isn't enough to hinder the kind of enemies I fight now, they're just too strong for a mutation of that level to have enough of an effect. Not to mention, I'm more than happy for my foes to get up in my grill and take a shot. My diamond carapace and inner plating are more than capable of absorbing punishment! Not to mention my self-healing abilities are becoming better and better.</p>, <p>No, kiting my opponents isn't what I need, so the stickiness has outlived its usefulness as the primary factor in my acid. The magic eating is still effective. Being able to dissolve shields, chew away magical effects and even weaken incoming spells without using my brains is super useful. Big fan of this aspect, I'm glad I reinforced it when I mutated my acid gland to +20. But now I need to find something else to add into the mix.</p>, <p>What's it gonna be.</p>, <p>I scroll through the list, trying to find an option that brings my existing mutations together whilst offering a new flavour for my merchandise. I flick over to my other acid based organs, trying to find what I want from my acid. Eventually I end up going back to my main acid gland. At +20, it still needs to be improved to +25 and I suppose it makes sense that I start here as I try to jazz up my production line.</p>, <p>Options, options, options. What sort of acid do I want? There are a lot of choices that jump out at me. Acid that burns? Acid that freezes? Acid that freeze burns?! That's new. Acid that chews through inorganic matter better? Acid that eats light. Like… how? Why? Regenerating acid that reproduces itself? So like, after you shoot it, it actually makes more of itself until it runs out of stuff to eat? That's… strong. What else we got? Don't want to commit early.</p>, <p>Dammit Gandalf, you always make this so hard! I swear if I look through here long enough, I'm going to find a mutation that causes the acid to chew through time or something. Ah, there it is. Makes the target age as it eats their future. What the hell is that?! Come on Gandalf!?!?! Are you outside your mind?! Why would you put an option like that in there? Reading closely, it seems as though the effect is rather weak. You'd need a ton of mutations, and then basically submerge someone in a tank of the stuff in order to meaningfully age them. Fair enough then, that seems like a balancing factor.</p>, <p>Let's go back to this acid that makes more acid as it eats stuff. I feel like this could be useful. It synergises well with my existing mutations. The stickiness will have more of an effect, because it'll just keep multiplying, getting more and more gloopy. As for eating magic, it'll keep eating away at whatever mana it touches until that mana construct is gone, even if I don't keep firing it. I'm starting to warm to this idea…</p>, <p>I can blast out a wave of acid, and even if I don't hit much, it's still going to grow and become a problem. Let's not forget that thanks to my concentration gland, the acid itself is quite damaging, even if I don't have any direct damage mutations. The effect will be light at just the first mutation, but if I commit to it over this evolution and the next, then it should be able to do some work.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>After fiddling around a bit, I end up settling on the following mutations:</p>, <p>My Mana-Feasting Bind Acid Gland +20 will add the self-propagating trait and become the Propagating Mana-Feasting Bind Acid Gland +25.</p>, <p>That is… quite the mouthful. Hopefully it becomes a little more readable when I compress these traits down. I'm assuming I get to do that again at +30. in addition to that, which will take a good 115 chunk of Biomass out of my reserve, I've made upgrades to the rest of the business district to bring the whole thing together.</p>, <p>My Acid nozzle has had its pressurised trait reinforced and then gained the scattershot mutation. My theory being that if the acid is able to make more of itself, then applying a little bit of it to a wider area will allow me to bring the slow burn of never ending acid to a massive number of foes. Alternatively, I can use this mode to blast a scattershot onto a particularly large enemy, creating dozens of acid hotspots that will only grow over time. That's taken it from +10 all the way to +20 for a cool 155 Biomass.</p>, <p>The Acid Concentration gland has so far been used to power up the traits inherent in my main acid gland, thickening the mixture, so to speak. That's great, and I reinforced that at +15, but for +20 I wanted to emphasise damage, and the concentration gland had a wealth of options to boost the effectiveness of my produce in that department. The usual suspects make an appearance here, elemental damage and so on, but rather than take those options, I had the gland inject a little extra spice into the mixture, a little addition that will reduce the defence of whatever the acid hits to the melting effect. Should help kick the deeps of the acid to the next level.</p>, <p>That's another 155 Biomass which turns my Potent Acid concentration gland +10 to the Thickened Weakening Acid concentration gland +20. My acid stimulation gland is still stuck at +10, but I'll have to deal with that for the moment. Not to mention, none of my new acid components have reached +25. It's going to take a heck of a lot more Biomass before I'm finished revamping the commercial zone.</p>, <p>With a weary sigh, I check over my selections once more and then give Tiny a subtle nod. He nods back, a serious look on his face, for once, and moves to block the entrance to my chamber. Once she notices what's happening, Crinis detaches from me and manifests her body to block all line of sight to me from the outside. Not even my annoying body guards will be able to see what goes on in this space!</p>, <p>Operation \"Blackout\"' is in full effect…</p>, <p>Confirm!</p>, <p>HARCK!</p>, <p>FTTTT… SHABA…</p>, <p>COLLIBLAMAWAGAAAAA!</p>, <p>It itches so bad! Dammit all!</p>, <p><em>Not far away.</em></p>, <p>Corun and Torrina make their way through the Colony discussing theories and options that they'll need to present to Anthony the next time they get the chance. They could talk for hours on this topic, this is their purpose, as well as the entire focus of the cult, after all, but they got the sense Anthony wasn't quite as interested in pouring through the details, so they were determined to work out the kinks in their research before speaking to him again.</p>, <p>After a few minutes an easy silence fell as they both lapsed into their thoughts.</p>, <p>\"Hey, Torr,\" Corun broke his silence.</p>, <p>\"Yes?\" she prompted.</p>, <p>\"What do you think Anthony meant when he mentioned itching?\"</p>, <p>She pursed her lips and frowned for a moment as she considered.</p>, <p>\"I've no idea,\" she admitted, \"do ants get itchy under their carapace?\"</p>, <p>\"You want to ask one?\"</p>, <p>They both hesitated. The ants could get quite touchy when it came to their carapace.</p>, <p>\"Maybe ask him next time,\" Torrina suggested.</p>, <p>Corun nodded. That sounded like the best plan.</p>, <p><em>Deep beneath the surface…</em></p>, <p>It took a few seconds for the dizzying sense of vertigo to fade, and with it went the nausea. Morrelia took a deep breath and resisted the urge to raise the faceplate of her runic armour to take a better look around.</p>, <p>\"Don't,\" the stern voice of her father rumbled from her side, causing her to jump.</p>, <p>\"Commander,\" she ground out, her temper flaring, \"surely you have better things to do than babysitting new Legionnaires?\"</p>, <p>\"It's only normal that my personal guard be near me, is it not?\" Titus spoke levelly.</p>, <p>Morrelia felt a spark of the berserker’s rage ignite in her chest and she shoved it down, brutally. Not for the first time she wondered if she shouldn't have tried so hard in her training. Her apparently glowing reports from the Iron Church and her field Centurions had given her father the perfect excuse to keep her close at hand. She'd protested vigorously when she'd learned of her assignment to the commander’s guards. In fact, she'd been so mad she'd dared to pay a visit to her mother in the hopes that the woman would overrule her husband.</p>, <p>A total waste of time. Her mother had been delighted to see her and wrapped her in a bone-crushing hug the second she entered her office, but when she'd told her of her grievance, the Consul had simply laughed at her and shrugged it off.</p>, <p>\"He might look like he's carved from stone, but did you really think your father would risk losing you?\" her mother had asked seriously.</p>, <p>When Morrelia had argued, she found herself gasping on the floor, crushed under the weight of her mother's aura.</p>, <p>\"Let it go daughter,\" came the command, delivered in ice cold tones, \"you are strong, your promotion is not unwarranted. Besides, I too have no desire to lose any more children.\"</p>, <p>And that was that. She'd hoped that over the years she might have closed the gap between her and her mother, but it looked as if it had only grown wider. How that was even possible when the woman spent all her time in an office, she had no idea. How did she even get that strong?!</p>, <p>\"Welcomesssssssss to you,\" a sibilant voice slithered through the air and defiled the ears of the Legion.</p>, <p>She didn't know what it was about it, but she felt unclean just hearing that voice speak.</p>, <p>\"Who -\" she began.</p>, <p>\"Later,\" Titus said.</p>, <p>He strode forward, the light in his eyes giving away his burning anger to those who knew him as well as his daughter. He hated dealing with these creatures. Maybe once he was done with ants he could persuade the leadership that it was time for another crusade. The demons were a cancer that should have been exterminated centuries ago.</p>, <p>The axe on his back responded to his anger, stirring in its sheath as it echoed his rage back at him. With a push of will he forced its influence from his mind.</p>, <p><em>You'll never win,</em> he thought at the entombed demon within. <em>You are destined to lose to me for the rest of your existence.</em></p>, <p>The soul trapped in the weapon bellowed its fury and tried to claw at his mind, but Titus endured the blows and forced it back into the axe where it prowled like a wounded dragon. Being back in its home strata had woken it up more than it had been in decades but Titus had no fear. He'd conquered the demon when it was alive and he'd dominated it every day since.</p>, <p>Without turning, he could sense the stern demeanour of the thousand armoured figures at his back as he strode forward to negotiate their passage. The Legion had arrived in the third strata. Soon their work would begin.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>When the itching finally fades away, Crinis peels herself off the walls and regroups back onto my carapace to reveal something I didn't expect to see. Protectant, her cover dropped without me having to drag her out of the shadows for once, stands right in front of me, in the centre of the room. Exposed to my senses, she wears a nervous air, as if the simple fact of been able to be seen makes her uncomfortable.</p>, <p>\"Didn't expect to see you, Protectant. What's up?\"</p>, <p>Her antennae twitch in surprise.</p>, <p>\"The rest of the nest? The surface nest? The surface? About two hundred million tons of rock and soil? I don't understand the question, Eldest.\"</p>, <p>Sometimes I forget the ants aren't up to speed with the lingo.</p>, <p>\"I just mean to see what's up with you. I mean - forget it. Why are you out of cover? I assume you have something to say?\"</p>, <p>\"Where have you been?\"</p>, <p>The question is more direct than I expected, but it's pretty much what I thought she'd say.</p>, <p>\"Right here,\" I'm still not going to bow down to these babysitters.</p>, <p>\"We couldn't see you.\"</p>, <p>\"I know, that was the point of Operation Blackout.\"</p>, <p>As I announce the name of my scheme I can see her antennae go crazy with barely suppressed excitement. These damn security guards are as bad as the council. They love nothing better than a truly awful plan title.</p>, <p>\"Why did you need to hide from us?\"</p>, <p>I can almost see her force her intrigue away in order to focus on the point at hand.</p>, <p>\"Sometimes an Eldest needs a little privacy. You'll just have to deal with it.\"</p>, <p>\"It makes it hard for us to do fulfil our purpose.\"</p>, <p>\"What did you think was going to happen to me here in the nest? Forget it, you'll just need to cope. We're heading out to do some grinding deeper in the strata now. I want to make sure you and your team keep levelling and progressing your mutations. You can't protect me from anything if you're too weak.\"</p>, <p>\"We'll keep ten on you at all times,\" she says sullenly.</p>, <p>They hate the idea of getting stronger for some reason.</p>, <p>\"That's fine. The others should probably hunt in teams of five, or ten depending on the level of the opponents. Let's move.\"</p>, <p>Tiny is the first to move, leaping to his feet from where he sat at the entrance to the chamber, his muscles bunching with excitement as he does his little gorilla boxing shuffle, throwing mini-punches into the air. The ape is pumped up and ready to fight. In fact, even Invidia has allowed his Cheshire cat grin to appear. Seems like the whole crew is ready to rumble.</p>, <p>Who am I to deny them? We speed out of our chamber and race through the nest, taking the fastest route through the mighty gates (still being reinforced) and taking new paths deeper into the strata. It's hard to move too quickly in the second strata, what with poisonous little barbs attached to almost everything we see. By now we've become far more comfortable traversing the tunnels and we need less breaks to heal Tiny after he stumbles into something else that wants to kill him.</p>, <p>In this way, we make solid progress as we descend, clearing out tunnels and stripping them bare of Biomass. The pure black mana pulses from the walls, filling the air like tar. I swear that it's getting thicker. Is there going to be another wave soon? Somehow I get the feeling it'll be harder to deal with this time, exposed to the second strata, and the third beneath it as we are now. If we can master the technique that Rylleh used to push the Dungeon veins out of their territory, we'll manage to survive it much better, I should ask how we're progressing with that the next time I get a chance.</p>, <p>For now, I don't need to focus on that. There's only me, my pets, my babysitters, and the need to smash as many monsters in as short as possible a time frame. We need dat sweet, sweet experience! Elemental constructs whizzing with mana, I step forward and unleash all the mana I have into our foes as we press forward. Slowly but surely, the levels come.</p>, <p><em>In the third strata.</em></p>, <p>\"Do you know what we're going up against?\" Myrrin asked her friend.</p>, <p>Morrelia frowned and resisted the urge to spit.</p>, <p>\"No,\" she said sourly, \"the old man loves his secrets. Aside from the fact we're in the third strata, I don't even know where we are. I don't think anyone does. The commander is keeping his cards close to his chest.\"</p>, <p>The two remained standing to attention along with their full Legion as they awaited permission to exit the citadel they had arrived in. Even though the Runic Armour shielded them from the elements, the searing heat scalded their skin and the taste of ash filled their mouths. Morrelia had never been in the third strata before, and she wasn't particularly enjoying it now. That was understatement. She'd barely seen any of the place, and she hated it.</p>, <p>The Legion was thoroughly drilled, to the point that when the commander strode back into the hall in which they waited, not a one of them moved. But the tension in the air certainly raised a few notches.</p>, <p>\"Finally,\" Morrelia muttered as she strode forward with her fellow guards.</p>, <p>Her centurion, a grizzled veteran named Pompeus, shot her a dark look and she sighed internally, knowing that she'd get another grilling. She wished he wouldn't waste his time, she'd done everything she could think of to get thrown off this duty, but Titus wasn't having it. She had too much respect for the Legion to keep pushing the boundaries and fallen into line, but a few muttered complaints were inevitable in this situation.</p>, <p>\"We've got our marching orders,\" the commander told them, \"form up the troops for an address, we move out in an hour.\"</p>, <p>Immediately, auxiliaries were sent running to inform the centurions as Morrelia and her comrades fell into line behind the commander. She spotted Myrrin in the crowd and rolled her eyes which caused the younger woman to stifle a laugh behind her visor.</p>, <p>In a matter of moments, things were ready and a thousand heavily armoured, heavily armed members of the Abyssal Legion looked to their commander expectantly. Titus wasted no time.</p>, <p>\"Legionnaires. Welcome to the first deployment of our newly formed Legion. We have many old faces from Liria, new recruits from around Pangera and a smattering of veterans from the deep world. I welcome you all.\"</p>, <p>He paused to stare at them for a moment and each soldier met his eye with firm resolve.</p>, <p>\"We've not had long to acclimate, only a few weeks. Like most units, the real work of forging us into a cohesive whole will be done in the fires of battle. We have been deployed to the Plains of Lang, directly beneath old Liria.

            "[<p>Now, with my privacy secured, it's time to mutate. Time to dive once more into the depths of the menu lists and bring back only the finest mutations. It's time to begin where it all began: my eyeballs. It seems like a lifetime ago that I first mutated my eyes in order to improve my then terrible vision. Even now I'm not satisfied with my eyes, but then my memory of what it was like to view the world as a human is more than a little funny by now. I've been in ant form for months now, and even then I've been in five different ant bodies so far. It's hard for me to remember exactly what my eyesight was like as a hatchling at this point, let alone remembering what it was like in my previous life.</p>, <p>I might have been a human for fifteen years, but recency bias is real!</p>, <p>Alright then, my vision is currently sitting at +20. The Heightened Perimeter Eyes have served me well during the siege. The improved clarity has been a massive boon, helping me make the best of my reflexes by seeing the threats coming at me from all directions. In hindsight, my focus has really been to try and take all the best parts of compound eyes (multi-directional vision) and combine it with the benefits of a more humanish eye setup. The end result is that I still have compound eyes, but each one of the thousands of tiny lenses that make up my eyeballs are almost as good as those within a normal eye. It's pretty crazy to think about. That level of precision and complexity would be completely impossible for a normal creature on Earth, yet here I am on Pangera, an ant with super vision.</p>, <p>And there's no need to stop now! I want sharper eyesight! Better motion tracking! In all directions at the same time! Gweheheh!</p>, <p>The only way to achieve something like that is to just keep piling on the upgrades, one by one. The list of mutations in the menu is as overwhelming as ever and the crazy options overflow. X-ray vision, firing heat blasts from the eyes… why though? TIME VISION? See things … after… they happened? Isn't that just normal vision? Or this like a peering into the past kind of thing? Seems far less useful than the future vision I get from my antennae… Weird.</p>, <p>I can't even begin to imagine the sort of things that would pop up in here if I cashed in my eye mutations when I evolve. Laser eyes? Curse eyes? Goodness knows. I trawl through the seemingly endless list until I find the sorts of things I'm looking for: upgrades that continue to track in the direction my mutations are already going. Plenty of stuff to expand the range of the vision, another upgrade like the one I chose earlier which creates patches of sharper focus. Eventually I find what I'm looking for in a generic focal enhancement. With this, my eye shall become the Sharpened Perimeter Eyes + 25!</p>, <p>Lock it in, what's next on my list?</p>, <p>The Pheromone Gland! The ol’ faithful. Who would have thought that the simple mutation of the language gland would have such far reaching impact? Come to think of it, packing the capacity for language into one mutation is a little generous of the System, isn't it? It's not the sort of thing that Gandalf is known for, the stingy bearded bugger. I wonder if this became some sort of standard mutation for more intelligent bugs down in the depths? It does teach language, not really, it just expands the range of scents the pheromone gland can produce to have sufficient gradient that language can be expressed. It does increase it a lot though… The pheromone gland went from \"danger, food, warm, cold\" to \"hello guest, please be welcome. Care for some tea?\" all in one mutation!</p>, <p>Eh. I'm not going to look a gift mutation in the pheromones… or whatever. What do I want here? To be honest, most of the upgrades here seem like a waste to me. There are options that do all sorts of things in here, turning pheromones into weapons, as a sleep poison, even a choice that helps create sensory illusions in organisms that smell them, basically hallucinogen scent! But since I use them strictly for communication purposes, most of these options are bunk. I'll just take one that makes my pheromones travel further so I can 'yell' harder. My last two mutations were both about making my pheromones more persuasive, which in hindsight is a bit of a waste. I don't need to be persuading the Colony, they don't need any help doing what I ask them.</p>, <p>So my Convincing Pheromone Gland +20 will become the Loud Convincing Pheromone Gland +25. Next!</p>, <p>I've got the three acid glands to deal with and the Gravity mana gland. I'll think I'll do the Gravity gland next. For every single mutation I've selected for my Gravity Mana Gland, I've gone down the same path, which is to expand the capacity. This is for a few reasons, namely that the Gravity Bomb takes a huge chunk of mana to cast and the better I get at condensing mana the more mana I need to fuel the spell. But I want to take something different this time, I want to borrow a leaf from (of all the beings) Tiny. His lightning glands have a great little mutation that condenses the mana inside the gland. It doesn’t condense it much compared to doing the work manually, but it gets the process started. It also has the benefit of making every spell I weave with mana straight out of the gland a little bit stronger without me having to do any heavy lifting.</p>, <p>So the Unending Gravity Mana Gland +20 will now become the Compressing Unending Gravity Mana Gland +25</p>, <p>Three upgrades down and a cool three hundred and forty five Biomass gone, just like that. The only body parts I have left are the three new editions to the business district and the neural network, not all of which are sitting at +20 yet. This part is going to be expensive, I hope I have enough to afford it, I really don't want to have to eat anymore right now. Firstly, I'm going to look at the neural network. Who would have thought that starting to mutate my nervous system would have such a beneficial effect in the long run? Combined with my carapace and my antennae, this nervous system has been what kept me alive long enough to reach this level. Having impossibly fast reflexes is always a win, no matter what. The question is, what do I want to mutate into the network now? Trawling through the list, I can see upgrades that will help me make it even faster, but at this point, I'm not sure that's even necessary. I'm already reacting <em>to the future</em>, having my nerves send signals .0000001 of a second faster doesn’t seem necessary at this point.</p>, <p>So what do I want my nerves to do? They do the job that nerves do extremely well already. They send signals and they do it really, really fast. What else can I possibly want here? I pour through the list, weighing up the options I find until I come across one that I like. This mutation creates nerve bundles at certain points in the body that help manage coordination better. It's like how an octopus has a separate set of nerves for each tentacle, helping to coordinate the movement of each limb so they can work together. If I'm not wrong, this may even synergise with my existing mutations, since the hyper fast signals will be transmitted to these new bundles, who could make my legs move without my main brain even having to be contacted! Perfect!</p>, <p>The Instant Transmission Sub-Neural Network +20 shall become the Coordinating Instant Transmission Sub-Neural Network + 25! Boom!</p>, <p>Now, it's nozzle time. So far I've upgraded it to increase the range of my acid shot and introduced a scattershot mode. I'm pretty happy with both upgrades as is, to be honest. I don't need to have absurd range with my acid, I'm not trying to turn myself into a sniper or artillery like some of the scouts are, and the scattershot does a good job spreading the acid over an area when I'm shooting at max range. If I upgraded that mutation more, the acid shot would eventually become more like a shotgun, blasting over an area up close, which I don't think I need. So I'm in the unusual place of looking for a new upgrade. What has the menu got for me?!</p>, <p>Lots. It has lots. Just like everything else, there's a ton of options that seem either excessive, weird or rather imaginative. There's the usual list of properties that the nozzle could add to the acid, including elemental damage, somehow. There's actually an ignition option here as well, which I suppose would be handy if I turned my acid flammable. Hang on, I could literally shoot fire out of my backside?! Holy moly! It's a bit more extreme than what I'm looking for though… As usual, I'm more interested in mutations that move along the lines of what the organ was intended to do in the first place. The nozzle makes aiming easier, helps me shoot further and can scatter the acid over an area. Is there something I can purchase that will help aim? I trawl through the list for a while until I come across just what I'm looking for.</p>, <p>It's an odd little mutation that adds a bundle of nerves to the nozzle that assist in making unconscious aiming corrections. Combined with my rapidly climbing accuracy Skill, this mutation could help me hit the target first time every time. Just what the doctor ordered!</p>, <p>So the Hyper Pressurised Scattershot Acid Nozzle +20 will become the Guided Hyper Pressurised Scattershot Acid Nozzle + 25! That's a mouthful. I guess that's what happens when you mash three different mutations onto one organ.</p>, <p>Now the acid concentration gland! I really like this gland, it was cheap to buy and its sole function is to be the acid gland's hype man. It makes whatever the acid is already doing, do it better, and I added the weakening property to try and drain my enemies during long fights. It's a solid combo and I think I'm going to stick with it by enhancing the weakening property this time around. It's pretty simple to find the mutation I want and with this the Thickened Weakening Acid concentration gland +20 becomes the Thickened Draining Acid concentration gland +25!</p>, <p>Nice.</p>, <p>One to go! Six hundred and ninety Biomass down the drain! Holy smokes this is expensive. Checking my Biomass total, I think I'm just going to have enough to squeak all of the necessary mutations in, although the last one is going to be the priciest. The Fatiguing acid stimulation gland of +10. I need to upgrade this dude three more times! Better get to it. Activating the menu I upgrade the gland to the +15 mark and choose to consolidate the existing mutation. The stimulation gland works to increase the production of acid, which is great, the mutation I chose lets the organ drain stamina in order to replenish the acid faster, which works well with my Vestibule since my stamina is topped up by that organ. For the +20 and +25 upgrades, I kind of want to go in a different direction, see what else the menu has to offer.</p>, <p>There's plenty to choose from, as usual. Most of them are around different ways to increase the regenerative speed of the acid, but others are a little more creative with their interpretation of what 'stimulate' means when it comes to the acid gland. Stimulate it to do what? Make more acid? Thicken the acid? Bring about change in the acid? Add properties to the Acid? It's a complex system I've got going on back there and only the finest produce are allowed to emerge from it, so I need to pick well.</p>, <p>In the end, I select something that works with what I have already. This mutation drains stamina, but rather than increase the production rate of the acid, it thickens it, making it more potent. This obviously synergises on multiple levels with my existing setup. By the time this is done my acid is going to be craaaaazy! At +25, I choose another mutation to enforce my new selection and with that I'm finally done!</p>, <p>The Fatiguing Acid Stimulation Gland +10 has become the Exhausting Thickener Acid Stimulation Gland +25! Whoo!</p>, <p>[Do you wish to confirm these selections? This will cost nine hundred and sixty Biomass.]</p>, <p>Holy McBiomass! That's a lot! Do I have enough? I do! By… two. Phew, that was close! Confirm it all, Gandalf! Let's get his show on the road!</p>, <p>… Any second now.</p>, <p>…</p>, <p>Here it comes…</p>, <p>…</p>, <p>BLATTAPHLATTACAAA! It's so bad! MY NERVES ARE ON FIRE DAMMIT!</p>]\n",

            "[<p>When the itch finally fades away I find myself on my back, my legs splayed in all directions and pinned down by the barbed tentacles of Crinis.</p>, <p>[Crinis? What happened?]</p>, <p>[You were flailing too much, Master. I thought it better to hold you down than have you slip out of my containment.]</p>, <p>That would be a disaster that would increase my risk of being seen by at least three hundred percent! That cannot be allowed!</p>, <p>[You did the right thing Crinis. Well done. Any chance you can let me up now?]</p>, <p>[Oh! Yes!]</p>, <p>Somewhat reluctantly, the limbs retract back into the orb of shadow flesh that still conceals me and I roll onto my feet. It was bad this time, real bad. Doing so many high level mutations at the same time? It's always bad, but a few of the organs made it worse. The sub-neural network is brutal every time, the eyes are a particular sore point for me, and doing three separate organs inside the business district just made that whole scenario back there into a nightmare. It's done now though, Anthony, just forget about it and move onto the next job. Getting close to evolution time!</p>, <p>[Alright then everyone, job's done. Let's get moving to the next one.]</p>, <p>My pets file in behind me as I stumble out of the chamber and back out into the tunnels where I find Granin and the others waiting. My body feels a little awkward, as it always does after a heavy dose of mutation. I think the neural changes are affecting me the most.</p>, <p>[All done?] Granin asks.</p>, <p>[Fully mutated,] I confirm, [time to sort out the core.]</p>, <p>His eyes brighten at the mention of the core.</p>, <p>[I heard you had an interesting specimen you'd reserved around here somewhere. I'd love to take a look at it.]</p>, <p>[As long as you're quick,] I grumble, [I need to absorb that thing and I don't particularly feel like building up the suspense.]</p>, <p>As a group we file along the tunnels, with a few Colony members tagging along to keep track of me for the Council. Seems like they want to know where I'm up to with the process of evolving in real-time. I guess it's a big deal not only for me, but for the family as a whole. Not to worry, Colony! I won't let you down. After a quick journey we arrive in a chamber not far from the Core Shaper's work area and after a quick discussion with a nearby ant we settle in. A few minutes later, Bella and Ellie arrive with a selection of cores, including one enormous sample gripped in Bella's mandibles.</p>, <p>\"Here you go eldest! This should be enough to max you out, and here's Garralosh's core, just as you asked!\"</p>, <p>\"You haven't fiddled with it, have you?\" I ask.</p>, <p>The two of them look shocked.</p>, <p>\"Of course not! We've studied it extensively, but we followed your instructions and made no alterations to the core itself! Even though we really wanted to!\"</p>, <p>\"Shut up, Bella!\"</p>, <p>\"Whoops!\"</p>, <p>\"As long as you didn't tamper with it, it's fine. Make sure you check with Crinis, she has some new cores for you to play with.\"</p>, <p>It wouldn't actually matter if they did. As far as absorbing a core goes, you can mess with it as much as you want before absorbing, the energy contained within the core is the same, but for whatever reason I didn't want them playing with Garralosh's core. It just didn't feel right.</p>, <p>\"Is this it?\" Granin brightens up when he sees the chunky core enter the room. \"Can I take a look?\"</p>, <p>He waits for me to give him permission before stepping over and gently lifting the core out of Bella's grip. What follows is a brief but vigorous discussion between the three golgari as they take turns analysing the core and giving their thoughts. Corun and Torrina have already had a look at it before, but it's clear how much they value Granin's insight by how attentively they listen when he speaks. The guy is an authority on monsters, after all.</p>, <p>[Are you guys done?] I break in. [I've got evolving to do over here.]</p>, <p>[Oh! Right.] Granin starts at my words then turns and places the core on the ground in front of me before stepping back. [It's not often I get to see the core of a monster one of our sister cults deemed worthy of mentorship. She was a powerful beast, although with a lot of wasted potential. I still find it staggering she was able to move on the surface at this level of strength, the effort involved for the Kaarmodo must have been exhausting.]</p>, <p>[I don’t have that much sympathy, to be honest,] I tell him dryly as I look down on all that remains of the reincarnated human. You were one crazy monster, Garralosh, sorry you had to end this way.</p>, <p>I start off with the normal cores, reinforcing my own until I hit the limit. Last time I took in a special core as well as a rare core beyond this point, something I don't care to repeat. Gandalf himself told me that such a thing normally results in death and I'm not one to tempt fate twice.</p>, <p>\"Okay then, here we go.\"</p>, <p>[Compatible Rare core detected. Would you like to reinforce your core, or reconstitute the monster?]</p>, <p>Reinforce me.</p>, <p>Just as every time before, the core begins to dissolve into pure energy that twists through the air and into my body, suffusing the hard gem in the centre of my being and growing it. The pain is terrible as always, the enlarged core pushing up against my insides in ways it was never meant to. Garralosh's core is <em>huge</em>, much larger than the rare core I absorbed last time. If I had to hazard a guess, if it were even a tiny bit larger it would no longer qualify as a rare core, instead being pushed to whatever stage came after that.</p>, <p>It takes several minutes for the process to complete and by the end I am feeling as if I had eaten another meal the size of the last one. I feel bloated, stuffed, gassy, and twinges of pain fire through my body every time I try to move. Ugh. I hate this.</p>, <p>Crinis wraps herself around my carapace and pats me on the back with one tentacle, which does help somewhat. Tiny just points and laughs at me. Damn ape, you'll get yours when you evolve again, just you wait.</p>, <p>With my core as large as it's going to get at my current evolution, my max MP now sits at a rather impressive 530. This is a heck of a lot more evolutionary energy than I've ever had to work with before. A nervous energy starts to bubble within as I get ready to take the final step.</p>, <p>[Alright then. Time to evolve.]</p>, <p>Granin smiles wide.</p>, <p>[What?] I ask him.</p>, <p>[Me? I just love this stuff,] he shrugs, [powerful monsters and evolution have literally been my life's work. Give me a break if I get excited.]</p>, <p>[Doesn't hurt that I'm also a candidate for an ancient that you identified either, does it?]</p>, <p>His smile widens.</p>, <p>[I have to admit that it does add a certain zest,] he agrees. [Where are you going to do this? Here?]</p>, <p>[No,] I sigh, [they want me back in the other chamber where monsters won't spawn.]</p>, <p>Which means I have to walk back. Yay.</p>]\n",

What the heck are you doing here?!\"</p>, <p> The priest and his acolytes are gathered at the entrance to the chamber, all dressed in their robes with the antennae sewn to the top with their hands in the air as if summoning the great sky god. At my yell, they all flinch and turn towards me, bowing deeply once they see me coming. It's Beyn who first replies, speaking to me with his human voice, which I obviously can't understand.</p>, <p> \"I have no idea what you're saying, man. Give me a minute.\"</p>, <p> The priest looks frustrated by his inability to communicate via pheromones despite being able to understand them. How would he even 'speak' via scent? What sort of difference can a Class make in a human body? I whip together some mind mana and reach out to the one armed human.</p>, <p> [Well?] I demand.</p>, <p> [O GREAT ONE! WE HAVE HEARD OF YOUR ASCENSION AND HAVE COME TO - ]</p>, <p> [Loud! Tone it down you oaf!]</p>, <p> [Ah! I apologise great one… My brothers and sisters have heard word of your ascension to a higher state of being through the Colony. We have no desire to interfere in the process, but merely wish to be present for this holy and sacred occasion.]</p>, <p> Seriously?! He's so sincere too! All of them are! They're staring at me with such light and hope in their eyes!</p>, <p> [Alright, fine! Just stand outside the chamber and try not to be a nuisance. I can't believe you were even allowed this close to the brood.]</p>, <p> The look of joy that breaks over the priest's face is so bright it almost burns away all ten thousand of my retinas. He immediately turns to the others and within seconds, all of them are shouting with joy and openly weeping.</p>, <p> \"Quiet, would you!? The brood chambers are right next to this place! If you disturb the young, don't think the brood tenders will go lightly on you.\"</p>, <p> When they receive my pheromone message the gathered antmancers regain control of themselves and return to a much quieter form of dumb behaviour. How did any of these guys survive the siege? They're clearly damaged. They look so damn happy though, I just don't have the heart to chase them away.</p>, <p> \"All right, move aside please. I need to get into the chamber.\"</p>, <p> As I walk past them, a few reach out to try and lay hands on my carapace, which I wouldn't really mind, but before they can touch me their hands are slapped away by small tentacles that emerge from the dark shadows on my back. Crinis says no, apparently. Inside the chamber, I settle into a comfortable position with the triad of Shapers assembled before me.</p>, <p> [Crinis, Tiny and Invidia. You guys chow down on the left over Biomass whilst I get settled. Once I start evolving, I'll be in your care until I wake up, okay?]</p>, <p> [Yes, Master!]</p>, <p> [<em>It ssssshall, be ssssso.</em>]</p>, <p> Tiny is already eating…</p>, <p> [Alright kid, you ready?] Granin asks.</p>, <p> [Ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Why are you guys here anyway? Aren't we basically done with the advice process and such?]</p>, <p> Corun steps forward.</p>, <p> [Yeah, we were just hoping to hear about the options you get in the evolution menu. We, as in, the cult, document these sorts of things and there's precious little information for powerful ant evolutions. Like, almost none.]</p>, <p> [Look, I don't mind <em>you guys</em> knowing about some of this stuff, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with you taking it back to your cult. Come to think of it, will you guys even be welcome back with the Shapers?]</p>, <p> [Unlikely,] Granin shrugs, [bridges are pretty much burnt to the ground at this point. We can keep the info under our hat if that's what you want. There's a good chance we can learn more about your species and the different ways the System views your progress through the options you're given.]</p>, <p> [Alright then, here we go.]</p>, <p> Come on then Gandalf, let's get this show on the road.</p>, <p> [Would you like to use the evolution menu?]</p>, <p> Hit me!</p>, <p> [Congratulations on reaching the maximum level for your current species. Evolution will allow you to change your form and increase your stats as a monster.</p>, <p> Warning: evolving will make securing XP and Biomass more difficult as fewer rewards are given for preying on creatures less evolved than yourself.</p>, <p> Your evolution options are as follows: (All options are formica sapiens)</p>, <p> </p>, <p></p>, <p>[Holy moly! That's a lotta options!]</p>, <p> [How many did you get?] Granin asks, his voice intent.</p>, <p> [Three normal, three special and four rare.]</p>, <p> Corun whistles and Torrina looks impressed.</p>, <p> [That's a good number, means the System sees lots of potential paths in you. Only having one option isn't necessarily bad, but it means your avenues to develop have been narrowed to only a single path. Having lots at this stage means there's many directions for you that the System views as viable.]</p>, <p> I check through the list again.</p>, <p> [Looks like the rare options I saw last time aren't popping up again. Nothing about the Nascent Hive Mind or Collective Mage are here. I was kind of expecting they might still show in the list, perhaps in a different form.]</p>, <p> [Generally speaking, when a monster turns its back on a specialised path, the System won't present that option again,] Torrina says as Corun starts scribbling down everything I say into a little notepad. [Rare evolution choices tend to be very specific and often cut off paths when selecting them, so when you didn't take those options, the System disregarded them for you. Generic choices are still likely to show up all the way though. I'm guessing that there are Soldier and Worker type evolutions in the normal choices, right?]</p>, <p> I nod.</p>, <p> [Just so.]</p>, <p> Well, I'm not going to complain if the System no longer wants to turn me into an immobile mind controlling brain.</p>, <p> [Alright then, let's go through these.

            "[<p>In the interests of expanding the Colony's knowledge of future evolution options, I take the time to explore the normal evolutions I've been offered and let the eager triad document the stat gains, organ benefits and descriptions offered by the System. In truth, the stat gain for even these 'ordinary' evolutions was much higher than I expected and my hopes climbed sky-high for what the more delectable 'rare' choices would have to offer. With the first three options out of the way, I take the time to go through each of the special evolutions carefully. You never know if there might be a diamond in the rough!</p>, <p>[Special Evolution: Ant Archmage. +60 bonus to Cunning, +60 Bonus to Willpower. This evolution provides a significant boost to the power of the mind, along with a Manaweave Core Crystal. This new organ grows around the core and focuses the user's mind on the mana contained within, making it easier to handle and use. A new eye is also granted, the 'mana eye', which allows the Ant Archmage to project mental sensing abilities through the eye to increase their effectiveness.]</p>, <p>This is a special evolution?! Look at these stats! And the bonus organs are nuts? Manaweave Core Crystal? Excuse me?! This seems like a super useful organ for a monster like me who focuses more on traditional spellcasting using mana from the core than most monsters who rely on mana glands.</p>, <p>Granin looks impressed with the offering.</p>, <p>[That's better than I expected, to be honest. If you wanted to focus on a pure spellcasting build, this wouldn't be a bad option at all. Don't underestimate the Mana Eye either. It might not be as expensive as the crystal in terms of evolution energy, but it's no slouch. You can think of it as directly bumping your mana sense up a rank for free, and that's <em>before</em> you mutate it.]</p>, <p>[That's… super good. Isn't it?]</p>, <p>[Heck yes it is,] Corun seems excited, [if you took this option you'd almost be as good at spell shaping as Invidia!]</p>, <p>Being as strong as one of my pets, one that I already defeated, doesn't make me all that happy. Still, the gulf between Invidia’s and my mastery of magic is vast. Even getting close to his level will be hard. It's tricky to remember sometimes, since he's just a little floating eyeball with tiny wings and arms, but Invidia's mass is like, ninety percent brain.</p>, <p>[The mage ants will want to know about this one for sure,] I muse, [make sure you guys let them know when you complete your report.]</p>, <p>[Of course,] Granin nods.</p>, <p>Onto the next.</p>, <p>[Special Evolution: Colony Guardian. +80 bonus to Might. +80 bonus to Toughness. Focused on physical prowess, the Colony Guardian receives a large bonus to physical stats, furthermore, additional purchase of physical stats are cheaper during this evolution.

Am I missing something?]</p>, <p>[You're probably undervaluing what's being offered quite a bit,] Torrina frowns, thinking. [A reset consumes quite a bit of energy, so getting one for free is always an excellent thing. As to the physical stat cost reduction, this is also an excellent saving. If you poured all your evolutionary energy into physical stats in this evolution, you could gain a truly monstrous boost. It's like getting bonus evolutionary energy from thin air.]</p>, <p>[When you put it like that… I suppose it's better than I thought.]</p>, <p>[Honestly, out of the two options we've seen so far, I think this one is better,] Granin advises, [You would sacrifice your mental stats in this evolution, but you could make yourself a physical powerhouse. Still, as we discussed, I wouldn't recommend a carapace reset this time around.]</p>, <p>[Right.]</p>, <p>… and demonic chitin might sound strong, but it surely isn't as shiny as <em>living diamond</em>. Just wait for me, my precious…</p>, <p>[Special Evolution: Hive General. +20 bonus to Cunning, +20 bonus to Will, +40 bonus to Might, +40 bonus to Toughness. A frontline leader, the Hive general benefits from mixed stats and grows in power the more of their kind fight on the battlefield. The Hive Storm Aura gland will provide a scaling bonus to physical prowess, healing and ferocity to all members of the same species within range, the more affected by the aura, the stronger it becomes. In addition, a Collective Tactical Cortex will be added.]</p>, <p>Yeesh. This one sounds strong also…</p>, <p>[This is good stuff,] Granin looks impressed. [No reset, but that scaling aura is <em>nasty</em>. I've heard about it popping up a few times in the past when hive insects have spawned, it never ends well. Seeing it at tier six kind of surprises me, but then again not many insect monsters get that high, certainly not communal ones.]</p>, <p>It almost sounds a little insulting when he phrases it like that, but I can't disagree with him. With tens of thousands of members, the Colony will struggle to push many members to tier six anytime soon.</p>, <p>[What the heck does the cortex do?] I ask him, I want to see if he knows before I check with the System.</p>, <p>[From what I understand it's like having a mind map of every member of your species within range. You know where they are and how they're doing, generally speaking. I suppose the idea is that you can instantly respond to changes on the battlefield.]</p>, <p>[Fair enough.]</p>, <p>I double check quickly and the golgari is spot on. Granin really knows his stuff.</p>, <p>[Alright, enough with the appetisers,] the old Shaper rubs his hands together, [time for the main course! Let's take a look at the rare options!]</p>, <p>Just as excited as he is, I fire up the menu for the first of the rare options.</p>, <p>[Rare evolution: Elemental Ant. +80 bonus to Cunning, +80 bonus to Will, +20 bonus to Might, +20 bonus to Toughness. The Elemental Ant is a force of nature, with devastating spells that cover all the basic elements. In pursuit of Elemental perfection, some potential is lost. A mythic Omni-Elemental Mana Flux is formed around the core. The Antennae will be remade into Spectrum Crystal, able to better channel elemental mana and sense its flow. An All-Season Eye is granted. As a price, all non-elemental mana glands will be removed and banned. Non elemental mana based skills will be unavailable in the menu.]</p>, <p>Yikes! This is some heavy stuff! Holy stat gain! I relay the information to Granin and he once again nods appreciatively.</p>, <p>[I'm starting to think the System will reward communal insects who make it to the upper tiers. Spectrum Crystal is not third strata, maybe not even fourth… It's clear that your rank five fusion has opened this option for you. I have to say, it's strong. Very strong.]</p>, <p>[What is this Mana Flux thing?]</p>, <p>[A Mana Flux is like a … whirlpool. It draws mana in and changes its attribute before storing it in the core. This is the only way I know of that a core can hold attributed mana.]</p>, <p>[And since its omni-element…]</p>, <p>[It'll hold all of the elements. You won't even need a construct to change it,] he confirms.</p>, <p>Wow-ee. This is impressive stuff.</p>, <p>[And the Crystal thing?]</p>, <p>[It's basically a substance that reacts well to elemental mana. If you were to cast spells through your antennae, they'd become more powerful. Mutations would only enhance that further.]</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>[The eye?]</p>, <p>[Lets you see elemental fluctuations. It's a specialised version of the mana eye from earlier.]</p>, <p>[All of this seems like good stuff.]</p>, <p>[It is,] he agrees, [that's why the cost is high. You'll cut off a lot of future potential, but the payoff is massive.]</p>, <p>This bears some thinking about…</p>]\n",

            "[<p>[I don’t see you demon… are you going to show yourself or - HOLYGIZZADIGUP!]</p>, <p>Even as I ask for the creature to show itself, it seems to <em>blink</em> into existence on the edge of my vision, shocking me with both its sudden appearance, and bizarre form. A giant eyeball wreathed in fiery tentacles that appear almost more like tongues of flame than appendages of flesh stares down at me like a watchful sun.</p>, <p>[I did not mean to shock you,] the voice in my mind says, [I have been here some time, but have hidden my presence by erasing it from your mind up to this point.]</p>, <p>[Isn't that a bit rude?] I challenge the demon to help cover my unease at having my mind invaded so easily. [You can't go around just diving into people's minds willy-nilly! How the heck did you even do it?!]</p>, <p>My guard is up. <em>Way</em> up. This demon is clearly powerful, a tier seven, much like the huge brute who stomped away earlier. Its appearance is something like a cross between Invidia, Crinis and a bonfire, giving it a disturbing visage to say the least. Instead of the intense green of Invidia's own eyeball, this demon’s eye is red, as in totally red. The iris is red, the pupil is a different shade of red, and the white? Let's just say it isn't all that white. Looking into this thing's eye is like looking into a fire in a fire in a fire in a fire.</p>, <p>[It is how I protect myself,] the demon doesn't seem perturbed by my attack, [being a physically weaker creature, I use my mental prowess to hide myself from the attention of those that would seek to do me harm.]</p>, <p>[Seems like it would also go a long way to making it rather easy to <em>inflict</em> harm,] I point out.</p>, <p>[That is also true,] it responds, unbothered.</p>, <p>The rest of my party has reacted to this sudden presence with a display of aggression. Tiny has snatched up the hatchling once more, putting his body between the newcomer and Brilliant, whilst Crinis has made herself known by threateningly extending some ghastly limbs from her resting place on my back. For his part, Invidia has continued to hover, <em>threateningly</em>, his eye blazing with envious light.</p>, <p>The demon floats in the air with no apparent effort, looking down on me as we continue our stand off for several long moments.</p>, <p>[Sooooo…] I try.</p>, <p>[Ah. I apologise, I was lost in thought.]</p>, <p>A pause.</p>, <p>[Hello?]</p>, <p>[Ah. I apologise, I was -]</p>, <p>[Lost in thought?! Again!? Can you please just let us know if you're going to try and eat us or what so we can either get to fighting or running away?! I'm getting antsy over here!]</p>, <p>Heh.</p>, <p>The eye flickers at my sudden barrage and after a brief pause begins to explain itself.</p>, <p>[I have approached you for a very specific reason,] it starts, [I have spoken to you in the hopes that you will slake my hunger.]</p>, <p><em>DANGIT</em>.</p>, <p>[KILL!] I bellow and prepare to leap into action.</p>, <p>The eye blinks in surprise before vanishing right before my eyes, causing my heroic dashing leap to end with me planting my face into a wall, knocking the already damaged side of the building in completely. That slippery corona-demon! Where the heck did it go?! I frantically try to sever the connection it has with my mind, but find my efforts are fended off as the creature smothers my attempts.</p>, <p>[I should be clear,] the voice rings out again, [that I hunger not for your flesh, but for <em>knowledge</em>.]</p>, <p>As it pronounces that word, I can almost hear the ravenous hunger boiling away beneath that seemingly calm and patient manner of speaking. I pick myself out of the rubble and turn around to find the demon has once more appeared, hovering in the air in exactly the same place as before.</p>, <p>[You hunger… for knowledge? What kind of demon wants to turn itself into a encyclopedia? That doesn't seem to be how you guys operate, from what I've seen so far…]</p>, <p>[What is… an encyclopedia?]</p>, <p>[Oh… Uh. Like a book filled with huge amounts of information organised so that it can be easy to find.]</p>, <p>With a blaze of energy, the eye <em>ignites</em>, the flare of heat drying my eyes in a split-second.</p>, <p>[Hot! Hot!]</p>, <p>The fire subsides quickly, and the demon appears as before, hovering calmly above us.</p>, <p>[I apologise,] the voice is once again contained and unruffled, [I have never heard of this concept before. I find it… <em>delicious</em>.]</p>, <p>This is seriously weirding me out.</p>, <p>[So… if you don't mind me asking… what sort of demon are you? One that craves knowledge over Biomass? I just don't think I've ever heard of that.]</p>, <p>[I do not mind. It is important that you understand my nature if we are to complete our transaction. I am an Avarice demon, but one of a particular nature. Avarice demons desire to take and hold that which belongs to others, to accrue vast wealth. But the form of that wealth may change from demon to demon. There are some who hoard precious jewels and minerals, such that the humans and those like them are ignited with greed. Others seek to amass slaves, controlling the life and fate of many others.]</p>, <p>Interesting…</p>, <p>[So being an Avarice demon means you have a hunger, but each one of you has a different preference in food?]</p>, <p>The giant eye hovers for a moment.</p>, <p>[That is apt,] it concludes. [This is a fundamental aspect of demonic nature that I sense you may not be aware of. All demons are driven by some manner of <em>obsession</em>. The more highly evolved a demon is, the more refined that obsession has become.]</p>, <p>There's something interesting about the way it framed that…</p>, <p>[So is it evolving that refines the obsession, or is it refining the obsession that leads to evolving?]</p>, <p>Is there some element of the demonic monster archetype that is fundamentally different from other monsters? From what I understand, that's not the case, I certainly haven't seen anything like that when examining Invidia, for example.</p>, <p>[The one plays into the other,] the demon responds. [But you have asked an interesting question, one with a <em>lengthy</em> answer. Now we come to the nature of my request. I have seen that you are new to Roklu, new to this stratum and have many questions, questions that I can answer. In return, you have <em>knowledge</em>, information that I wish to possess. I propose a trade.]</p>, <p>[Since you managed to barge into my mind uninvited, couldn't you just take what you want? Why go through the bother?]</p>, <p>I'm not sure I trust this fire-eye.</p>, <p>[Information <em>extracted </em>in this way is incomplete and fragmented. <em>Unsatisfactory</em>. I hunger for the whole meal, not a collection of scattered morsels.]</p>, <p>[So… let me get this straight. You're offering to be a … guide?]</p>, <p>The eye blazes bright once more.</p>, <p>[What is this… <em>guide</em>?]</p>, <p>[Holy smokes! It's a person that shows other people around, gives them key information about the place they are in! Chill out a little!]</p>, <p>[<em>Interesting</em>. Yes. I propose that I shall be your guide. In return, you shall give me the answers that I seek. I view this as an even trade. Do you accept?]</p>, <p>I mean… I don't really see much of a downside… As much as I dislike having a demon as strong as this one following us around, I don't think that we couldn't take it on if we worked together, provided we can find a way to counter it’s ability to vanish from our mind's eye. On the other hand, we stand to gain a lot.</p>, <p>[I guess we have a deal.]</p>, <p>In response to my words, the eye smoulders with barely suppressed hunger.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>[A demonic existence can be reduced to a single need: obsession. There are many forms that this desire can take, almost innumerable, but every demon feels it. Provided we are given the freedom to pursue this obsession, we are largely content. Though this does not mean we are peaceful. A slaughter demon has but one desire, and it will seek to fulfill that desire always.]</p>, <p>[So… if a demon is going around killing other demons in Roklu, you just… let it go about its business? That hardly seems like it would be conducive to allowing other demons to 'freely pursue their obsession'.]</p>, <p>[As with anything to do with demons, there are no hard and fast rules. A demon of murder killing others is to be expected, it is its nature, so it is not punished for such. Kill too much, and the demon in question could be exiled, sent across the plains to find another city.]</p>, <p>[Not killed? You guys don't kill as a punishment here in Roklu?]</p>, <p>Judging from what little I saw of Grokus' compound, they <em>definitely </em>do.</p>, <p>[We do, but it is generally the city lord who would enact such a thing. It is the right and the responsibility of the strongest demon in the city to enforce their will on it. Those who do not appreciate this burden are free to leave, either to find another city more to their liking, or eke out an existence on the plains.]</p>, <p>[How do you think Grokus has been doing here?]</p>, <p>[I have answered your question,] the blazing eye turns toward me, focusing the full heat of its gaze upon my shiny self. [It is now time for you to answer mine.]</p>, <p>[Fair enough,] I gesture with an antenna, [go ahead.]</p>, <p>The demon, who we've come to know, actually has a name, as do most demons who live in the city, apparently. I was a little surprised at first when he introduced himself, but hey, if a demon wants a name, who am I to go about not using it? So it was that the giant eye wreathed in tongues of flame that hovered around us came to be referred to by his proper title: Allocrix. Or Al, depending on your mood.</p>, <p>[You have mentioned this 'Colony' before. Describe it to me. I wish to <em>know</em> more of it.]</p>, <p>[The Colony? I suppose that's fine. I guess I should ask first off, how much do you know about ants?]</p>, <p>The eye roars with flame.</p>, <p>[<em>Little</em>.]</p>, <p>I sigh.</p>, <p>[Alright then, I suppose I start at the beginning.]</p>, <p>We continue our somewhat bizarre stroll around the plate city of demons, Roklu, whilst I expound on the ants of the surface world. Tiny insects capable of forming vast mega-colonies, a collective so unified as to act as a single organism as the eyeball in the centre of the aurora borealis listens with childlike fascination.</p>, <p>[You have two stomachs?]</p>, <p>[Social stomach and a regular one,] I confirm, [that way some of our food can be regurgitated later for sharing purposes.]</p>, <p>[<em>Fascinating</em>.]</p>, <p>[Alright, that's a lot for one question, obviously you want to know more, but I think it's my turn, surely?]</p>, <p>A pause.</p>, <p>[Very well.]</p>, <p>By this time we've made our way toward the edge of the plate and I have to say, the view is rather striking. The vast emptiness vanishes into the distance, well beyond the point my eyes can see as the heat haze and ash eventually blocks my view. Far, far below, the Plains of Leng, even now a writhing carpet of weaker demons locked in eternal combat, the flats pierced here and there with pillars of rock, mountains with sharp cliffs and flat tops. It's mesmerising in its own way. I can't believe this vast field circles the entire world.</p>, <p>The chaos of Roklu has continued around us, as more demons emerge and begin to resume their normal activities the noise and movement has steadily risen back to what I presume is a more normal level.</p>, <p>[Can you explain what the deal was with that giant demon smacking someone down in the middle of town earlier? Something seemed a little off about it, and you were in that area also…]</p>, <p>I'm quite curious about that incident. The fact that there were <em>two </em>tier seven monsters in that spot, when they seem quite rare in the city from what I've seen. In fact, as far as I can tell, there's three.</p>, <p>[That situation… <em>frustrating</em>.] Al falls silent for a moment as he contemplates his response. After a few moments he speaks up again. [Demon politics can be simple or complicated, depending on the particular demons involved. When it comes to demon politics, there is only one issue that is fought over, who will be the city lord.]</p>, <p>[I'm going to guess, the strongest demon?]</p>, <p>[Generally, it is so. <em>Simplistic</em>. Grokus has ruled over this city for hundreds of years, generally by exterminating any who would grow strong enough to challenge. Now, two demons who are strong enough to mount a challenge have arisen in short succession.]</p>, <p>[I'll jump in and say, you and the big guy?]</p>, <p>[It is so.]</p>, <p>[Pretty darn obvious, isn't it? You three are the only tier seven monsters that I've managed to detect in the city.]</p>, <p>[The only reason you detected me, is because I allowed it to be so. Do you assume that there are none others who are capable of what I can do? <em>Presumptuous</em>.]</p>, <p>Oof.</p>, <p>[That's fair enough,] I sigh. [So there are two challengers for the throne? As it were?]</p>, <p>[In a sense,] the fire dims around the Avarice demon as he sinks down toward the floor, seemingly depressed. [I have no wish for the role. The scheming, the fighting. <em>Nuisance. </em>I wish only to pursue and hoard knowledge, that is my desire. Mongu'nin does not share my indifference.]</p>, <p>[The big guy?]</p>, <p>[It is so. He actively wishes to challenge Grokus for the position of city lord, but feels he must dispense with me, the other challenger, before he can make his claim.]</p>, <p>[Wait, so he wants to challenge, but won't until he's managed to … what… kill you first?]</p>, <p>[Yes.]</p>, <p>[Then he'll go and challenge Grokus, and I'm going to assume that this challenge is a fight to the death.]</p>, <p>[It is so.]</p>, <p>I clack my mandibles.</p>, <p>[You demons sure don't mess around.]</p>, <p>[As I said, simple, yet complicated. I have been hiding from Mongu'nin for weeks, just as I have hidden from Grokus and his minions, but the constant attempts to track me down have become…<em> tiresome</em>.]</p>, <p>I give Al a bit of side-eye, which isn't hard given the nature of my compound eyes.</p>, <p>[In other words, you wouldn't necessarily be averse to the city coming under new management?]</p>, <p>The eye narrows.</p>, <p>[I would not…]</p>, <p>[More on that later. So, what you're saying is, the big guy, Mongo, is trying to find and kill you, so that he feels justified in going and killing Grokus. Meanwhile, Grokus probably wants the pair of you killed, and is not shy about attempting to make that happen.]</p>, <p>[This is the case.]</p>, <p>[Is it safe for you to be wandering around town with us then?]</p>, <p>Sounds like all the powerful demons in Roklu want Al dead, so I'm surprised he's so comfortable wandering around the city with us.</p>, <p>[In this instance, I am counting on you and your twenty-three companions to dissuade the others from making any moves that might be considered… too bold.]</p>, <p>I suppose that's fair enough. I'm a little shocked that Al was able to penetrate the incredible abilities of my bodyguards to stay unnoticed. However he did that, I'm impressed.</p>, <p>Wait a second… twenty three?!</p>, <p>I rapidly turn to better focus on Tiny and the big ape looks back at me with confusion written plain on his face.</p>, <p>[Tiny! Where's the hatchling!?] I yell, panic creeping into my mental voice.</p>, <p>He looks at me, looks down at his empty hands for a long moment, then back at me. Very slowly, with great care, he lifts his feet and carefully inspects the soles.</p>, <p>[You didn't stand on her you thick shake! She snuck off!]</p>, <p>Because of <em>course</em> she did!</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>I don't mind sharing with you, my dear readers, that as much as I enjoy travelling around the wonderful world in which we live, exploring its many incredible, unbelievable sights and relaying them to you in my own quirky fashion, I do miss my bed. Oh! Such comfort! Such bliss! The means with which you have so graciously afforded to me my readers, they have not gone to waste! Enchanted stone-wood frame, carved ever so intricately with doves and vines, the mattress, with its three layered structure providing the perfect level of support and softness. The bottom layer, made from earth infused deep sponge, is my personal favourite. Stern and unyielding, but forgiving and with a warm heart. This is topped by the second, a cheeky four inches of water infused sea-king reeds which give the mattress that slight wobbly feel I love so much. Finally, the top layer, a full, luxurious six inches of tight stuffed down from the Cloud Ranging Sky Goose. It's like resting atop the fluffy pillows of the sky itself, dear readers.</em></p>, <p><em>Needless to say, this was not the level of comfort I enjoyed when staying at the Hill of Rest in Renewal, but Mrs Bellweather's establishment comported itself far better than I expected this distance from civilisation. I awoke refreshed and excited, ready to face another day in this remarkable land of ant and human.</em></p>, <p><em>After a short yet hearty breakfast, I was greeted just outside the establishment by my guide for the day, arranged by Mr Bellweather the previous day. A chatty know-it-all who would be more than happy to spend hours answering endless questions from an old duck, he assured me. I was quite pleased to find this was indeed the case when the young girl in question, a Ms Emilia Cretherton, greeted us with a warm smile the moment we stepped out the door. The first thing I had to ask was the nature of the particular garment she wore, which included a rather striking set of antennae like attachments to a band she wore through her hair. As Emilia was delighted to share, all members of the community who chose to take the ant related Class line wore such a headdress as an indication to others that they are available to work as translators between the ants and the residents!</em></p>, <p><em>A special Class line! I was stunned to hear of such a thing! Especially being shared so openly! Of course, I had to know more. Luckily, the cheerful young girl was all too willing to share. Supposedly, this information isn't even an open secret throughout the city, it was just something that was freely shared. Emilia informed us, quite proudly the dear young thing, that she had reached the first Class evolution, turning her 'Antmancer' into the well regarded 'Antspeaker'. This Class gave her the incredible ability to utilise mana to produce pheromones, which in turn allowed her to communicate with the ants without the need for any sort of mental magic! Incredible! Indeed, this ability was soon put on display as we made our way throughout the town. Some might have thought the residents would hide their close affiliation with their insect-monster allies, but nothing could be further from the truth. Ants roamed throughout the city, walking right alongside everyone else. The monsters themselves were of various sizes, ranging from large dog all the way up to a bull.</em></p>, <p><em>When one of them walked past us, I just had to know, so I turned to our guide and asked if she could please interpret for us so that we might converse with the fascinating creature. My two bodyguards were not at all happy about being so close to a monster they weren't allowed to kill and I was repeatedly warned from this course of action, but I heeded them not! If you have a chance to speak to a giant ant-monster reader, you take it!</em></p>, <p><em>Through our interpreter, I was to learn that this particular individual ant (unnamed, though I discovered than many ants choose to take a name, a fascinating subject all of its own) was in town to study the growth of crops. Of crops! She had recently graduated from the ant 'academy' and desired to study agriculture on the surface before attempting to take the lessons learned and apply them below ground. I had to ask, as I'm certain that you are also wondering, reader, what on Pangera an ant would need crops for, and she replied it was for the sapient population living under the care of the Colony, as if it were the most natural thing in the world!</em></p>, <p><em>And watching our Antspeaker communicate was a fascinating thing all of its own! Both Emilia and the ant made no sound, all our human translator did was raise one hand, glowing softly with the tell-tale light of mana to produce the pheromones, the scent that the ants use to communicate with one another. Just incredible!</em></p>, <p><em>After a brief chat, our ant friend went on her way and we continued our jaunt around town. Fear not, dear reader for there was so much more to see!</em></p>, <p><em>Excerpt from Chapter Four of 'Traveling Tolly in the lands of the Colony' published in the Monthly 'Pangera Gazette'</em></p>, <p>Brilliant?

I thought she'd been cured of the worst of it, yet here we are, in the middle of a literal city of demons, and she runs off on us?!

Such a thing should not be discouraged. I will make myself hidden and assist as I can from the shadows.]</p>, <p>[Alright then.]</p>, <p>Charge! With any luck, I'll be able to find the little interloper through the vestibule before long and we can avoid having anything dramatic happen in the meantime. Even now I can sense the twenty bodyguards scattering from this location, diving here and there amongst the buildings, twists and alleys of the city as they hunt down the scent of the runaway hatchingling. Where is she? Where the heck could she be?

The ruckus we cause is undeniable and immediately there are answering roars and screeches and the demons react to the cacophony.

This level of attention is the last thing we need… Maybe we can lose them.</p>, <p>[Quick! Take a hard left, we'll try to lose them around that corner!]</p>, <p>Stretching the strength of my claws to the limit, I divert my non-inconsiderable weight around a hairpin turn, dashing into an alleyway between two teetering buildings. A difficult manoeuvre that has strained my legs, but with any luck we've managed to break line of sight between us and our pursuers. Now quickly! Onto the trail of the hatchling!</p>, <p>BOOM!</p>, <p>Aaaand Tiny couldn't turn in time and has ploughed straight into the building on the left… that's perfect. Driven even further into his rage by the offending structure, the giant ape lashes out, his powerful arms smashing any remaining wall within reach and turning the stonework into dust.</p>, <p>[Enough with the wall! Come on!] I urge him and he shakes off the bricks and bounds to his feet, leaving a new collection of enraged demons in his wake.</p>, <p>Naturally, with their howling and slashing at the air, they make a perfect spotlight for the first pack of demons, who quickly follow after us. Just… perfect.</p>, <p>[I thought you were supposed to have the fanciest feet?!] I yell at Tiny but he's too far lost in his rage to hear me.</p>, <p>Perhaps losing track of Brilliant, who he'd been so protective of has really tipped him over the edge. Which could be a problem… nothing I can do about it now though. Recapturing the hatchling is all that matters now! How many tens of thousands of new ants have been born between Vibrant and Brilliant! She might be a handful, and a massive pain in the abdomen, but Vibrant is one of the strongest and most dedicated ants in the entire Colony, with her own high-levelled army to help her protect our family. If Brilliant is even half as capable when she's done evolving and developing her Skills then she'll be an incredible asset to the Colony. An irreplaceable part of the collective that will help uplift all of us!</p>, <p>Most importantly, without capable and selfless champions, how is the Colony ever going to develop to the point that they aren't dependent on me to protect them?! They need to be able to stand on their own six legs! I can't guarantee that I'll be around to help pull the carapace out of the fire every time!</p>, <p>Although an argument could be made that I'm the one who puts the carapace <em>in</em> the fire most of the time. Actually, to take that a step further, aren't I throwing myself into trouble and the Colony is the one pulling me out of it? Isn't that carapace in the fire in fact… me?</p>, <p>Ahhh! Worry about it another time! Get. That. Hatchling!</p>, <p>If there's no point trying to hide anymore then who cares about these alleys and gaps? I'm an ant, dammit! I'm going over the top! As I speed toward another building, instead of going around it I simply raise my front legs up and dig in with my claws, racing up the side of the wall and over the top.</p>, <p>BOOM!</p>, <p>Tiny of course doesn't realise what I've done and just runs straight into the building, leaving an ape shaped hole in the wall. Worry about it later! The sound of demonic shrieking and blades striking flesh rings out from below me as I continue running, followed by Tiny's bellow and the harsh impacts of fists striking home with tremendous force. Next thing, two demons are thrown out the side of the building with tremendous force, smashing into a neighbouring building and smashing <em>that</em> wall in for good measure. A chorus of growls and shrieks ensue.</p>, <p>Wonderful.</p>, <p>When I get my mandibles on that hatchling….</p>, <p>There she is! From my position on the top of the building, a faint wisp of energy trickles into the vestibule, snapping my attention around just in time for my antennae to catch a whiff of the little ant. With one dashing leap I throw myself across a gap and onto a nearby building where, looking down into the alley, I see a suddenly cowering Brilliant looking up at me.</p>, <p>\"Fooouunnnnd youuuuuu!\" I rasp.</p>, <p>\"S-Senior!\" she stammers, \"f-f-f-fancy s-seeing you here!\"</p>, <p>\"How dare you run away! In this city of all places! You'll pay, little hatchling! You'll pay dearly!\"</p>, <p>The little ant draws herself up, suddenly bold and yells back at me.</p>, <p>\"I held it in for so long! <em>So long</em>! You expect me to resist it forever?! I WON'T, I WON'T, I WON'T! I have to knooooooow!\"</p>, <p>So screaming, she dashes off, around the corner and out of sight in a flash. Think you can get away now?! When I have your scent?! You're a hundred million years too early to escape from me! In a flash, I'm off, all six legs moving so quickly they blur. I have her now, it's time to secure the capture.</p>, <p>[Crinis! Deploy!]</p>, <p>[With pleasure, master!] the black void attached to my carapace declares.</p>, <p>As I run, her tentacles emerge, latching onto the building around us so she can lift her body from my back. In seconds a writhing forest of thin tentacles is moving across the rooftops with me as we follow close in the footsteps of Brilliant.</p>, <p>\"No escape, Brilliant! I'll get you, no matter what!\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>I have been in many a dangerous or difficult scenario my dear readers, as well you know! It has been my joy over my forty year career to bring you my tales of adventure and insights into the many wonders our world of Pangera has to offer, and we have shared some incredible times. The blood falls of the hidden city of Paranah. The lost rhino tribes of the Folk! The crystal labyrinth within the mountain Ultima!</em></p>, <p><em>Despite these grand undertakings, I have to admit that the simple act of sitting down for a cup of tea and biscuits was enough to get my old heart pounding. Almost a shameful occurrence, my dear readers, and I have to admit I did smile at the irony of the situation. In my defence, this was no ordinary cup of tea!</em></p>, <p><em>For starters, the depth of flavour and maturity of the leaves were a cut above even what I had experienced before. My new companion enjoyed only the finest that the Colony had to offer and I have to say, though this may shock many a reader within the sun city, that the taste was quite equal to the famed 'Singing Hills' tea enjoyed around the globe in high society.</em></p>, <p><em>A shocking claim! I know! Nevertheless, my buds will not allow me to lie!</em></p>, <p><em>\"This truly is remarkable tea,\" I gushed to my host. \"The Colony has mastered the art of tea brewing to a higher extent than many will think possible.\"</em></p>, <p><em>Emilia politely translated for me and the giant queen before me bowed her majestic head in acknowledgement of the compliment. When I sat down I was informed by my guide that it was quite unusual to be granted an audience with a queen, though not many asked for one. The people of Renewal left the queens to their business out of respect and few others were brave enough to sit with them. I was informed that this was but one of eight queens who occupied the nest within Anthome and she was happy to meet with me given that she had completed her duties for the day.</em></p>, <p><em>\"What originally began as a desire to ensure their guests were well cared for grew into something of an obsession within certain sections of the Colony,\" Emilia passed the reply back to me, \"these ants have dedicated themselves to providing perfect comfort to any who stay within our nests. They have mastered many skills in this pursuit, weaving, pottery, crochet, baking, farming. There are vast fields within the Dungeon where ants tend to crops of wheat, rice and other surface staples, seeking to grow only the best.\"</em></p>, <p><em>I looked around the room we found ourselves in and the lush, even decadent furnishings that wouldn't embarrass even the finest of apartments. Dark wood tables and shelving that gleamed with a mirror shine that accentuated the grain in the wood, the rug beneath our feet was a masterpiece of the art, intricate patterns so fine they seemed to fold in on themselves to an infinite degree, even the cups we were using were expertly formed, with delicate paintings evoking a mood of freshness and warmth.</em></p>, <p><em>\"I take it all of this was made by the Colony then?\" I asked.</em></p>, <p><em>\"Indeed,\" the Queen replied. \"Our children often seek to lavish the best that they can provide on us, though we often ask them not to.\"</em></p>, <p><em>\"Oh indeed?\" I was surprised to hear this. \"I must apologise, for I do not know how a queen would normally be treated inside a colony, but I would have presumed you would be happy to be venerated. Are you not critical to the future of the Colony?\"</em></p>, <p><em>The queen with whom I spoke had introduced herself as Elizabant and she was a magnificent creature. Easily four metres tall and more than double that in length, she towered over me and the table we sat at to a ludicrous degree. The lustre of her carapace was remarkable and she positively gleamed, a picture of perfect health, no doubt due to the constant ministrations of her children. Despite her size she proved to be a delicate and gentle creature, her movements dignified and deliberate as we sipped our drinks and ate our cakes together.</em></p>, <p><em>\"We are indeed important to the family, it is true. Our children pamper us and are loath to allow any risk to befall us.\"</em></p>, <p><em>Which is certainly true. My faithful guards were not allowed into the room, nor was I permitted to form a mind bridge directly to the queen herself. To even approach the outside of this room I had been searched thrice and if there was one ant less than a thousand on guard then I'm more blind than my poor dog Phillipe.</em></p>, <p><em>\"Yet we do not view ourselves as above any other member of the family. Each of us has a role to play and without every member of the Colony working together we could not have achieved what we have done.\"</em></p>, <p><em>\"Isn't it true that there is one ant who is held in somewhat a higher regard?\" I asked shrewdly. \"The Eldest? Is this individual considered… above?\"</em></p>, <p><em>The queen waved her antennae gently as she considered the question.</em></p>, <p><em>\"Yes, and no,\" she told me. \"The Eldest was the first of us, was the one who made us what we are. We all seek to contribute to the success of the Colony and there are none who can hope to contribute more than the Eldest, so in that sense, there is reverence and respect. If you were to ask which ant carried the most authority within our family, it would be them.\"</em></p>, <p><em>\"Is it possible to meet them?\" my heart burned for this exclusive interview, my dear readers, burned! \"I would love to have a chance to write down the thoughts of such an august ant and share them with my readers.\"</em></p>, <p><em>The queen seemed a little taken aback by my request and Emilia leaned over and placed a hand on my arm.</em></p>, <p><em>\"You have to understand, Ms Tolly, that they are very protective of the Eldest. If you thought that it was difficult to meat Elizabant, this is nothing compared to how difficult it would be to contact the Eldest. At the moment they are very deep in the Dungeon and cannot possibly survive here in the first stratum. We could use the gates to move deeper within the territory of the Colony, but it would be almost impossible for you to come face to face with the Eldest.\"</em></p>, <p><em>Almost impossible?</em></p>, <p><em>\"So you're saying there's a chance?\" I smiled.</em></p>, <p><em>You know me, readers! I hate hearing the word 'no'!</em></p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"Are you <em>sure</em> that you aren't responsible, Eldest?\"</p>, <p>\"What are you talking about, Sloan? I've been the soul of caution out here. All of this can be blamed on the plant. How are we supposed to know that the kaarmodo and the bruan'chii are having some sort of dust up?\"</p>, <p>The general flicks her antennae in irritation.</p>, <p>\"We'd heard that there might be something of the sort going on, but we never expected that it would matter to us. Even though the kaarmodo sand empire is close to the former border kingdoms, we haven't done anything to provoke them, so we never expected them to act so aggressively toward us.\"</p>, <p>\"Seriously though, what's the issue between the tree and the lizards? What could they possibly be fighting over?\"</p>, <p>\"From what we've been able to gather it has something to do with resources and land in the fourth and fifth strata.\"</p>, <p>I stare.</p>, <p>\"How in the name of <em>heck</em> are you able to figure that out? We haven't been anywhere <em>near</em> the fourth stratum!\"</p>, <p>\"We have our sources, Eldest.\"</p>, <p>I eye the smaller ant.</p>, <p>\"You want to act all mysterious now? Fine. So what's the plan?\"</p>, <p>\"The Colony is still restructuring and expanding above so we want to avoid a major conflict if at all possible. We need to defend the garden until the grove keeper has arrived so we can learn why the mother tree has chosen to reveal herself to us at this time.\"</p>, <p>\"That makes sense. I'd love to know what's going on inside her head. How many are we up against?\"</p>, <p>\"As far as we've been able to learn, there aren't actually that many kaarmodo in the nearby demon cities, though they have a functioning portal in each one.\"</p>, <p>\"So we don't expect that many to come, but it could possibly be a heap?\"</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>\"Darn. How many are we bringing?\"</p>, <p>\"Ten thousand.\"</p>, <p>Oof. That's a lot. Most of them are going to be tier four, with a good chunk of tier five mixed in, but that's still a heck of a lot of monster.</p>, <p>\"When are they going to arrive?\" I ask.</p>, <p>\"They should be here in the next ten minutes. I left with them and rushed ahead to get here first. There are already scouts roaming ahead to find the approaching force. Things will come to a head here within the hour.\"</p>, <p>Quicker than I expected. Nice to see that everyone is so organised I suppose.</p>, <p>\"All right then, I'll go and take a sticky beak at what's happening.\"</p>, <p>\"Eldest…\"</p>, <p>\"I'm not going to fight anyone! Yeesh. Have a little faith would you?\"</p>, <p>The doubting… it's almost enough to hurt my feelings, honestly. I bid farewell to the general and step down from the rock we stood on, scuttling down the side to rejoin my companions below. It's barely been an hour since the garden grew and already we're in this mess. I have to thank the tree for her help the last time, but on this occasion she's thrown my family in the deep end and insects can't swim.</p>, <p>Although ants in the amazon are known to form living rafts and float along the flood waters, their entire Colony clinging together, with their queen in the centre of the mass, in order to survive. We might have to do that I suppose. Although I think I'm far too heavy for the surface tension of the water to support my weight… perhaps Pangera has particularly dense water?</p>, <p>[What do you think, Crinis? Do you think we're strong enough to take on an army of kaarmodo and their attendants?]</p>, <p>[We are much stronger than we were the first time we faced one, master. I believe you can keep us safe.]</p>, <p>[Come on Crinis, you're just as strong as I am. How about we keep each other safe?]</p>, <p>[V-very well… master.]</p>, <p>[How about you, Al? Do you feel like joining in on this one? And please don't appear in mid-air on me, my heart can only take so much.]</p>, <p>After a short pause I hear the demon's thoughts echo across the bridge.</p>, <p>[I will not,] he says, [I do not seek to make enemies of the kaarmodo. It is not my fight.]</p>, <p>[More than fair,] I admit. [Well, I suppose you'll be hanging around anyway, just make sure you keep your distance. Things are likely to get hairy.]</p>, <p>Which reminds me.</p>, <p>\"Protectant and company. Make sure you keep your wits about you. Pitched battles are a difficult place to be on bodyguard duty, so don't overdo it.\"</p>, <p>I don't get a reply, but I know that they're listening.</p>, <p>I wonder if Sarah is going to come out for this one. Probably not, considering her reaction to being contacted by Jim. I'm sure she doesn't want to risk being contacted by him again. So long as she stays up in the city back in Orpule, then I don’t see any way that he could get up there and bother her. I wouldn't put it past him to try though…</p>, <p>The dude has an unhealthy obsession to say the least. Shouldn't matter in the long run, since he'll soon pay for his crimes. In the meantime, I better do my part to protect this stupid garden so we can find out what the damn tree wants. Looking into the distance I can still see the big lizard and four setsulah attendants standing atop the outcropping. With a sigh I decide I may as well head over and attempt a diplomatic resolution.</p>, <p>Let me just say going into it that I don't expect it to succeed. In fact, I kind of feel like it'll end up with the kaarmodo attacking me. Don't ask me why, but I get the impression that no matter how hard I try to be accommodating, the parties I try to negotiate with always seem to end up in a rage. I can only assume that people on Pangera have short tempers or something, since I have been the soul of courtesy from the beginning.</p>, <p>I snap a bridge into place as we draw closer and try to sound as cheerful as possible with my smooth opening line.</p>, <p>[Getting any sun up on that rock?] I say, waving my antennae in a cheerful wave.</p>, <p>[…]</p>, <p>No reply, but I definitely feel a simmering anger across the bridge. Already?! What did I even say?!</p>, <p>[Look,] I try a different approach and assume a more serious tone, [I'm sure you don't want any of your brethren to suffer, or Gandalf forbid, die for the sake of pruning a stupid weed. Why not just let this one slide, eh? What's the harm?]</p>, <p>The giant lizard shifts slightly on the rock and I can feel the irritation bubbling away under the calm, near-motionless exterior. Something flickers between the attendants and I feel one of them connect to our bridge.</p>, <p>[The lord no longer wishes to address you, insect,] I am curtly told.</p>, <p>Immediately I feel them attempt to cut the bridge, but I hold onto it, rebuffing their initial attempts.</p>, <p>[You probably don't think we're strong enough to fight you, which is totally fine. Ants, right? First stratum monsters and all that. I get it. I just want to warn you that this might not go how you think it's going to go. You turn up here with a hundred, we're going to bring more. You turn up here with a thousand, we are going to bring more. And if you think we aren't able to hurt you… well, I guess you'll find out, won't you?]</p>, <p>Having said my bit I allow the bridge to be cut and turn so I can walk away, though I do in fact wander passed the outcropping so I can catch a glimpse of the lizards who are on their way. Right now I can't see them, but it won't be long until they get here, then we get to throw down in a big battle again. Finally!</p>, <p>… I mean. No. Bad.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Rassan'tep opened his eyes slowly. The warmth on his scales spread in waves through and penetrated deep into his muscles which nearly drove him back into rest, but the patient, still mind of his attendant helped focus his thoughts.</p>, <p>[What is it, Ammon'sil?]</p>, <p>[You have been asked to accompany an expedition, Old One.]</p>, <p>The great lizard blinked once, which was enough to cause his servant to prostrate himself immediately.</p>, <p>[I protested strongly against disturbing your rest, Old One, but the winds blew against me. The Mahaan has asked this of you personally.]</p>, <p>The words were digested is all things should be, with patience, as Ammon'sil remained pressed to the floor.</p>, <p>[There is no fault with you,] Rassan'tep said as he roused himself, shifting his legs to free them from the heated sand in which he had rested. [We must all serve the will of the Mahaan. Even if she is a young thing barely free from her egg.]</p>, <p>[I would not dare to say that she is unworthy to scrub your scales, Old One,] his setsulah replied from the ground.</p>, <p>[Rise now,] the kaarmodo commanded. [If we have been ordered to assist, then assist we shall. Gather the others and prepare my war garment. The sand bath can wait until our people have been served.]</p>, <p>Only now that he had been commanded did Ammon'sil rise and moved out the door, his steps smooth and languid despite his speed. As he awaited his attendants the Old One took deep slow breaths, his tongue flicking at the air as he gradually returned himself to wakefulness. By the time the setsulah returned, he had extracted himself fully from his bath and the six bonded servants immediately stepped forward.</p>, <p>Already rasped clean by the sand, his scales were polished and oiled before the ceremonial tapestries were laid over his back and neck. Next came the rings of gleaming gold around his legs along with the heavy, enchanted gorget that clasped around his neck. Bedecked in the finery that was deserved of a kaarmodo in its second century, the Old One held his forearms close his body as his servants did their work. Once all was ready, the six bowed low before he lowered himself to allow them onto his back. Only then did he step forward, exiting his temporary abode and entering the chaotic city of Bintran.</p>, <p>When he had made his way through the streets he found a gathering of his kind on the outskirts, the Mahaan herself in attendance. Rassan'tep approached, his arms clasped in front of him, before he roused the mana and connected himself to the bridge.</p>, <p>[Nice of you to join us, Old One,] the Mahaan said, eying him coldly.</p>, <p>He shifted his hands slightly, a pointed reminder that she was yet to grow the limbs as she had not reached her second century of life. Truly the Great Desert did not value this place if one so young had been placed in such a position of responsibility.</p>, <p>[Perhaps it is simply my age,] he replied and said no more, closing his eyes and resting, though he could feel his setsulah bristling on his back.</p>, <p>[Peace,] he said to them alone and they gradually relaxed once more.</p>, <p>[There has been a sighting of the mother tree nearby, within the territory claimed by the ant colony that has recently appeared around Orpule. Naturally we must seek to stymie the tree wherever it is found, especially when the hateful creature appears on our front doorstep. I have ordered a sortie not only from Bintran, but our neighbouring cities as well. Destroy the garden, then return.]</p>, <p>[What of the ants?] another asked. [What if they seek to oppose us.]</p>, <p>[I care not,] the Mahaan replied, [sweep them aside and deal with the enemy.]</p>, <p>When no more was said, the Old One opened his eyes once more.</p>, <p>[Let us leave,] he said.</p>, <p>Altogether a dozen kaarmodo, each of them too young to have grown their full set of limbs, gathered together with their setsulah and pooled their minds together to create a disc of force that could carry them all. The coalesced mana lifted them from the plate and out over the cavernous expanse before lowering them to the ground before it disappeared.</p>, <p>[Which way?] Rassan'tep asked.</p>, <p>[To the east, Old One,] another replied.</p>, <p>With no need for excess words or actions, he led the young group across the plains. With their long legs, they ate up the ground quickly without using any skills and soon met up with two more groups of a similar size. Brief greetings were exchanged before they continued on their way. When he had considered things enough, Rassan'tep finally reached out to Ammon'sil, the most senior of his attendants.</p>, <p>[Tell me of these ants,] he commanded, [I had heard nothing of them when I retired to rest.]</p>, <p>[I also have not heard much, Old One. From what I have been able to gather, they have recently descended to the third stratum from above and conquered Orpule along with another city.]</p>, <p>[They originate in the second?]</p>, <p>[The first, I believe.]</p>, <p>[Unusual.]</p>, <p>Monsters from the first were generally inferior to those from the second, which made descending quite hard on them. Demons were born far more powerful than those from so high in the Dungeon. For them to be able to conquer two cities so quickly meant they must be highly unusual.</p>, <p>[They are intelligent to a high degree for such weak monsters, and several highly evolved specimens have been seen, as much as tier six, I believe. Other than this, I do not know, Old One.]</p>, <p>[This is sufficient. I thank you.]</p>, <p>More to ponder as his legs ate up the kilometres. The real question was, why the mother tree would bother expending resources to manifest herself here. Was it for the ants? Was she trying to open a new front in her conflict with his people? Bes they nip any potential problem in the bud. Sweep it away as the wind swept through the desert, erasing all traces.</p>, <p>Soon they had arrived at their destination. A lone scout sat waiting on a high rock and in the distance the Old One could see the still budding garden of the mother tree bursting forth from the dark plains.</p>, <p>All that stood between them was a sea of motionless insects.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Rassan'tep looked out over the assembled masses of insect monsters and tasted the air with his tongue. Across the bond he could feel the minds of his attendants stir with trepidation. They had not expected to see so many. In the lead of the insect formation an enormous specimen, larger than the kaarmodo even, stood to attention, it's gleaming carapace reflecting the light of the embers that fluttered through the air in this stratum. Altogether the sight was an impressive</p>, <p>[Lend me your eyes,] he commanded, [let us examine them together.]</p>, <p>The setsulah, led by Ammon'sil, pooled their thoughts, allowed their mana to flow together before they collectively wove their spell and brought it back, laying it over their eyes. With their senses overlaid, the kaarmodo accepted the stimuli they provided and fed his own back into the collective. Immediately each of them shifted in place as the ant army in front of them blazed with a richness of energy that they had not expected to see. More than that, there ebbs and flows that should not be. The big one at the front, there was something… odd. Rassan'tep concentrated hard and even then he could just barely grasp the edges of that strange eddy, a curious ripple in the fabric.</p>, <p>[Release.]</p>, <p>The spell was allowed to unravel and the seven of them contemplated what they had seen.</p>, <p>[Speak your thoughts,] he invited his bond servants. [Do not stand on ceremony.]</p>, <p>Ammon'sil spoke first, as was his right.</p>, <p>[There are more than we expected to see, and they are more highly evolved than anticipated. This force is not to be underestimated.]</p>, <p>[The tier six has a core bursting with energy. Should it evolve again, it may even develop to the mythic stage,] Rapsep, wife of Ammon spoke next.</p>, <p>[A possibility exists that we may not be able to overcome them,] Chahan'sep spoke next, the surprise evident in the movement of his thoughts. [There is more to this colony than perhaps we expected.]</p>, <p>[The others may not see as clearly as we have. I believe that they may still think us to be a vastly superior force. It may be wise to consider retreat,] the youngest, Yuwan'sil said, which caused the others to turn and stare at her for her impudence.</p>, <p>[Peace,] the powerful mind of Rassan'tep rumbled, [I asked that you speak your thoughts, did I not?]</p>, <p>[You did, Old One,] Ammon'sil replied.</p>, <p>[Young Yuwan may well have the right of it. There is a chance we are outmatched here, which I did not foresee. There is also a strong possibility that the others will not arrive at this assessment, or ignore it even if that have. This is the brash attitude of the young and it should not surprise us. How can we expect them to know better? They have but a mere century of life behind them.]</p>, <p>The old kaarmodo considered for a time.</p>, <p>To an outsider, the standoff between the two forces, still over a kilometre apart, would have looked bizarre. Neither side moved. Not a muscle, or a twitch. The insects, as was their way, stood in perfect ranks, motionless, as if carved from stone. Likewise, the kaarmodo, with the patience born of their long lived nature and their reptilian ancestry did not stir, waiting and watching in perfect silence as their elder contemplated his course of action.</p>, <p>[We have been given a task by the Mahaan, so we shall carry it out,] he declared at last. [I will speak with the others and see what their appetite is like.]</p>, <p>He withdrew his thoughts from the connection he shared with his bondservants and expanded a bridge out toward the other kaarmodo who quickly latched onto the mana weave. Thankfully communicating via thought was so much faster other methods, they could afford to analyse their foe and coordinate themselves.</p>, <p>[We have taken a measure of our opponent. They stand between us and the garden that we have been ordered to destroy and it does not appear as though they will let us pass through easily. What are your thoughts?]</p>, <p>Generally the next oldest would be the one to speak next, but given that this war party was formed of adolescents and young adults, the hierarchy wasn't clear. As a result, dozens of minds leapt forward at once, creating a clamour as they competed with each other.</p>, <p>[This weak monsters shall be swept aside!]</p>, <p>[How can think to compete with us?!]</p>, <p>[We must obliterate them to send a message!]</p>, <p>[I believe some level of caution may be required…]</p>, <p>The final voice, a young female, was immediately piled in on as the others decried her perceived cowardice and lack of determination.</p>, <p>[These insect monsters have cowered before us for weeks. Now that we arrive in force they believe they can stand up to us? They shall be crushed beneath our claws, their attacks will brush off my scales like grains of sand. We should assault them immediately and rout them before we torch the garden.]</p>, <p>The Old One blinked slowly. Such a course of action would result in a resounding defeat. The kaarmodo were large and powerful creatures, each weighing tons, yet they were ill suited for massed combat. In short skirmishes they could throw their weight around and utilise their poisonous bites to great effect, but against more than a hundred times their number? They would be surrounded and picked apart, throwing away their greatest advantage, their magical superiority. Rassan'tep was tempted to show his teeth in contempt but he managed to restrain himself. He wasn't young anymore, such a display was better left for the impetuous and foolish.</p>, <p>Still, this stirring attitude had gained much support amongst the youth and they stirred, as if contemplating rushing forth at this moment without waiting for his order. An unthinkable course.</p>, <p>[You're too hot blooded,] he rebuked them and he could feel the young minds recoil at this stinging insult.</p>, <p>Such a thing to say to a reptile… yet they deserved it. Charging into the enemy? Such foolishness.</p>, <p>[We are not here to fight ants, we are here to destroy the garden. Ranged bombardment. Form teams of five and prepare to arc your spells over the insects. You have two minutes, begin now.]</p>, <p>Separately he reached out to the poor female who had been so rebuffed by the others for her caution.</p>, <p>[You have the right of it. I will commend your insight when we return.]</p>, <p>He didn't bother trying to correct the others on their misjudgement. They wouldn't listen to him, regardless of his standing or age, only experience would teach them so that was what he would provide.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Fanatics aside, there's plenty of stuff going on and not much time in which to get it done. With so many ants furiously working, I decide the best place for me is out of the way on the surface.</p>, <p>Well, I say surface, obviously I'm not climbing all the way out of the Dungeon. I head up until I break through and find myself sitting under the shade of the enormous Mother Tree, her branches and canopy spread out above me.</p>, <p>The fourth stratum really is a beautiful place to be. The mountain islands that rise up out of the crystal blue waters tower impossibly high. In between, the floating islands, with their endless waterfalls, drift amongst the clouds. Clouds… this far underground…</p>, <p>It's a bit nuts.</p>, <p>Truly, the power of mana makes anything possible. These impossible mountains, with their crags and cliffs, their forest-covered slopes with rivers and valleys. From who knows how deep to touching the roof of the stratum kilometres overhead, each one is absolutely titanic. And there must be thousands of them.</p>, <p>I can only see a few from where I stand, but I assume that they go all the way around the world. The size of the place is just ridiculous. The fact that the Mother Tree managed to take over a mountain for herself, basically consuming it, is utterly absurd. A feat that the Colony will soon have to replicate.</p>, <p>Our first priority on this stratum will be to establish our own nest, which means we'll need to conquer a mountain for ourselves! One that we can shape as we please, and fortify until it becomes an impregnable fortress of doom.</p>, <p>Luckily, I have a mountain in mind, and it isn't far away.</p>, <p>The termite nest will soon be available. Free real estate, as it were. We'll have the added benefit of living directly under the branches of the Mother Tree, cementing our alliance yet further. We don't actually know how this area is oriented with the rest of our territory, which isn't a huge issue, but it's nice to have all of our land vertically integrated.</p>, <p>Once we have our own functioning gates, it won't matter, all of our land will be one hop away from all the rest of it!</p>, <p>Gweheheheh.</p>, <p>Speaking of gates… I wonder how Brilliant is getting on with it all? She's obviously made great strides in her knowledge of dimensional magic. I don't yet know if she has the specific Skill for it, but I'm super impressed with her ability to sniff out the secrets that have so far evaded us. There's been a team of the finest ant mages trying to puzzle out how gates work for months, but the little champion has made more progress in a matter of weeks!</p>, <p>Good to know my naming sense hasn't weakened. I was worried she'd let me down there for a bit, but she came through in the end!</p>, <p>She should be back here soon enough, I'll catch up with her when she returns. Which reminds me, I really should check in on Sarah. I hope she isn't taking the fate of Jim too badly. It really wasn't her fault, and was totally out of her control, but it wouldn't surprise me if she was beating herself up over it. She's too kind to not try and divert blame from others and onto herself.</p>, <p>Hmm…</p>, <p>I think there's some movement beneath me. A quick dip into the Vestibule reveals that there is indeed a lot going on down there. Plans are being laid, hospitals built, for ants and for humans, strategy hammered out. The scouts are having the worst of it. A wide scale skirmish is taking place as the ants push out into termite territory and start collapsing tunnels.</p>, <p>I can feel them now. Earth mages are straining to break apart the stone in a series of controlled collapses while scouts cover them with long-range fire. The scene is repeated in dozens of tunnels as the Colony seeks to enact this strategy before the termites, or more importantly, the ka'armodo, can react.</p>, <p>I try to keep tabs on the fighting beneath the ground for a while before a familiar face pops up not far away.</p>, <p>\"Cobalt? What are you doing up here?\"</p>, <p>The little carver sees me relax- I mean, working hard here and skitters over to say hello.</p>, <p>\"Eldest, nice to see you contributing…\"</p>, <p>\"Watch yourself… I can put you back into training at any time I like.\"</p>, <p>\"… contributing with such diligence and vigour.\"</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>I remember the twenty when they were just grubs. How dare they get so uppity with me! It's not like I didn't nearly get myself killed trying to save the situation down here.</p>, <p>\"What's the story? Anything need building up here?\" I ask her.</p>, <p>\"Well, you did want us to magic up a gigantic bridge out of nothing didn't you?\" Cobalt responds.</p>, <p>\"Well… yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Right. So I need to get measurements for the width and height so I can get an accurate estimate of the volume of stone required. Once I have that, I can work out roughly how much mana will be needed, which will tell us how many mages have to take part.\"</p>, <p>I stare.</p>, <p>\"You can calculate how much mana is needed?\"</p>, <p>That sounds… different.</p>, <p>She flicks her antennae dismissively, already looking out over the wide waters between us and the distant shore of the termite mountain.</p>, <p>\"It's not that complicated. We know how much mana is required to create a cubic metre of stone, so if we can estimate the stone required, we can make the calculation.\"</p>, <p>\"It's that simple?\"</p>, <p>She clacks her mandibles.</p>, <p>\"Well, no. Of course not. There are a number of factors involved that influence the result. Higher rank stone magic obviously results in a more efficient mana-to-stone ratio. Distance from the caster is another important factor, the further away, the more mana required. Not sure exactly why. Ambient mana has an impact, local affinity has a strong effect, proximity to other stone. That's an interesting one, actually. Creating new stone near older rock is much easier, but making it near newer rock, like something we conjured, doesn't have much of an impact. Other elements are important too, for example, creating stone and soil near water is more expensive.\"</p>, <p>…</p>, <p>\"Sounds, actually very complicated.\"</p>, <p>\"It's not that bad.…\"</p>, <p>She already sounds distracted, calculating away in her head, which is impressive as hell. A few moments later, she clacks her mandibles again and starts to turn around.</p>, <p>\"Alright, that's done.\"</p>, <p>\"Already?!\"</p>, <p>\"It's just an estimate, I'm not being super precise. In terms of standard deviation -\"</p>, <p>\"Nope. Stop talking.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>I sigh.</p>, <p>\"I knew you'd all be smarter than I am, I just didn't expect the difference to be this wide, this quickly.\"</p>, <p>\"Don't feel too bad about it, Eldest. We just want to make sure you can focus on the things you want to focus on.\"</p>, <p>\"How long do you think it'll be until the attack is ready to start? I'm struggling to contain myself up here.\"</p>, <p>\"You and most of the ants down there,\" she laughs. \"Don't worry. In an hour, we'll be ready to go.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Under the soft light of the fourth stratum, with a soft mist rising from the glittering blue waters on the shore, the might of the Colony assembled. They had gathered in strength before, huge armies of ant soldiers, alongside smaller groups of human and golgari, but not quite like this.</p>, <p>Half a million ants emerged from beneath the ground and sorted themselves into neat ranks. They blanketed the shoreline. Between those inmoving chitinous frames, no trace of sand nor soil could be seen, they were so densely packed. In the lead stood a sparkling insect, enormous in size it loomed over the others of its own kind, a commanding presence that dominated the field.</p>, <p>Ten thousand support troops were spread amongst the ranks. Other races who had taken up arms alongside the Colony, ready to fight, ready to die, so that the ants would triumph. Within each group a robed figure walked, blessing each warrior and exhorting them to greater devotion in battle.</p>, <p>It was a terrifying sight.</p>, <p>Rassan'tep retracted his sight from the scrying array and sank deep into contemplation. That despite being so young, the Colony could already muster an army of this strength and size was worrying. Their growth was faster than even he had considered possible, and he projected it would only increase. To deal with this sort of power, the ka'armodo would need to commit a large force, thousands of their own number, with set'sulah War Dancer support and sand golems.</p>, <p>They had none of that here, only the termite Colony they had grown and fostered against all custom.</p>, <p>It was ka'armodo monster engineering against what a lone creature had been able to accomplish without training or assistance.</p>, <p>He wasn't confident that they would win. In many ways, it didn't matter. He was only interested in what Anthony would become from this moment on. Would the promising young monster die in the fighting, his rise to glory stopped tragically short? Or would he survive, and grow all the stronger for being exposed to the heat of battle?</p>, <p>He had to see.</p>, <p>[You seem excited, Master.]</p>, <p>The voice of Ammon'sil rang in his mind and the elder shifted slightly to better see his faithful servant.</p>, <p>[Is it so simple to tell? I would rather not have my emotions read so easily.]</p>, <p>[Not at all, Master,] the set'sulah smiled, [only those who have known you for many years would recognise that gleam in your eye.]</p>, <p>Satisfied, the great lizard shifted back and once more engaged with the scrying array. The grand sight of the massed ranks of ants, so neat they appeared to have been painted in place, once more appeared before him.</p>, <p>[What are your thoughts on the upcoming conflict?] Rassan'tep asked.</p>, <p>[It is not my place to comment.]</p>, <p>[It is, when I ask you to.]</p>, <p>[As you say. I worry for your kin, Master. They are confident in their abilities and in those of their creations, but I worry that they underestimate the foe before them. The Colony has shown that it will adapt, take risks, make decisions on the fly. Just because countermeasures have been prepared doesn't mean they will succeed.]</p>, <p>[You are speaking most carefully,] the ka'armodo noted. [You can come out and say it. Hubris. Overconfidence. Arrogance. Pride.]</p>, <p>Each word emanated powerfully from the ancient creature, an ocean of contempt behind them.</p>, <p>[The curse of the old races has shown its face again. Just because we ruled this world once, does not mean we don't have to fight for it now. The Colony is young, ambitious and rising quickly. My kin here think they are the same, but the difference is stark.]</p>, <p>He observed the ants carefully, noting the various castes and their disposition.</p>, <p>[The Colony is hungry, but for survival, not glory. They seek to build, not to maintain. The youths who were sent here… they see themselves as chosen, and special, instead of manipulated and abandoned. When cold blooded and logical thinking is required, they have allowed themselves to grow too heated.]</p>, <p>In the distance, there was movement. Thousands of ants stepped forward with unnatural precision. Mages, each and every one of them. Minds in perfect sync, they began to draw and shape the mana around them. With so many mages working together in perfect harmony, a vast amount of energy was able to be moved, a veritable storm of mana forming across the shoreline.</p>, <p>Rassan'tep watched carefully as the bridge began to take shape. It was crude in form, but well suited to the task, he had to admit. Sturdy, dense, compacted, the bridge was almost a kilometre wide. They even went to the trouble of anchoring it to the lake bed, extending pillars downward before the waters grew too deep. The great lizard hummed in approval. If they were nothing else, the ants were solid builders.</p>, <p>Gradually, the bridge extended and the ants began to advance in blocks, the mages at the front, along with Anthony and his small retinue.</p>, <p>At the current pace, it would take them little over an hour to complete the work, if they remained uninhibited. Of course they weren't.</p>, <p>Rising from the fungus coated forest, spheres of potent energy began to rise. They hovered in the air briefly, condensing, before they were suddenly fired in a high arc. Dozens of shots were fired at once, the combined efforts of nearly all the ka'armodo who remained on the mountain.</p>, <p>Of course the ants were prepared.</p>, <p>Shields sprung into existence, one after the other, covering the bridge for its entire length. Rassan'tep didn't even need to reach out with mind to see the spells of his kin were under assault before they crossed the halfway point, the mana being siphoned away.</p>, <p>The level of cooperation shown by the Colony was staggering.</p>, <p>With so many mages at their disposal, they were able to distribute roles and allow each ant to focus on just one task. That in itself wasn't impressive, but the way they worked so seamlessly together without communicating left him in wonder.</p>, <p>The bridge building never stopped, not for a moment. The shields continued to be created and reinforced, the moment one fell, it was replaced. There were even whole batteries of mages just reaching out with their minds and pulling in all the ambient mana they could, making it available to the others to utilise. Selfless, relentless effort. That was the defining trait of the Colony.</p>, <p>When the bridge reached the halfway mark, there was a pause.</p>, <p>The barrage from the ka'armodo continued, the ants held it at bay, but did not advance. A chance for them to replenish their energy? Allow the ambient mana to restore itself?</p>, <p>Perhaps.</p>, <p>He cast his eye across the field once more. Tens of thousands of ants now packed the bridge, but curiously, it wasn't full, not completely. A curious thing, he hadn't believed the ants would be concerned with overcrowding.</p>, <p>Then something changed. The massed ranks of ants split down the middle and stepped to the side, clearing a narrow pathway through the centre to the tip of the bridge, where Anthony awaited.</p>, <p>They were making way for something? Or someone?</p>, <p>From beneath the soil, amongst the gargantuan roots of the Mother Tree emerged a column of steel clad ants. Hundreds of them, each encased in powerful, ornate armour that shone with a mirror polish. With solemn and implacable steps, they marched steadily forward as Rassan'tep watched with keen interest. Then something different appeared.</p>, <p>Carried on the backs of ten ants came… a tomb? Four burning torches adorned it. Gold and precious metals covered it in elaborate filigree. Carved into the face of it in excruciating detail was the face of an ant, and though their expressions never shifted, somehow Rassan'tep felt a sense of overwhelming… relief, and joy, and freedom…</p>, <p>What in the name of the Demon God was going on down there?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Cardigant, the one who fell, and in falling, achieved true immortality. Her existence, or rather, the lack of ongoing existence, was something amazing to the Immortals, something precious.</p>, <p>It was, Leeroy decided, something that could not afford to be lost.</p>, <p>She and her sisters had come so close to losing hope! They had come within an antenna’s width of letting go of their dream. The rejection of their creed by the Colony, the ire and condemnation of the Eldest, the crushing failure of their tier six evolution, all of it had piled up to become a weight that was almost too heavy to bear.</p>, <p>Then Cardigant had done as they had done, she had gone into battle. But then she had done the miraculous. She had sacrificed her life, successfully!</p>, <p>It was a revelation! A confirmation! A resuscitation! All that Leeroy had dreamed of, all that the Immortals had dreamed of, it was still within their reach! They only had to stretch forth with their mandibles, grasp the sword of the enemy, and pull it into their own faces.</p>, <p>They would not lose their way again. She <em>refused </em>to let them! And so, something had to be done.</p>, <p>“Wait a second.” Smithant lowered her tools and looked at the crowd of anxious, heavily armoured ants crowded around her anvil. “You want me to <em>what</em>?”</p>, <p>“It’s very simple,” Leeroy said impatiently. They couldn’t afford to waste time! “We want you to create a permanent metal container to store the body of our beloved, fallen sister for eternity. That’s not hard to understand!”</p>, <p>Smithant stared hard at the council member, observing the maniacal, fanatical gleam in her eyes.</p>, <p>“W-why?” she asked flatly. “I can make something like that, sure, but why should I? It’s a waste of materials and a waste of my time. I’m supposed to be down here to help repair and upkeep your armour, not making elaborate boxes for you to store dead family members in. I’m terribly sorry for your loss, I mourn this fallen sister along with you, but let it go. Let her return to the Dungeon and let's get on with things.”</p>, <p>Leeroy was frustrated. She wasn’t one for words, normally, and had no idea how she could communicate just what she wanted, just what they <em>felt</em>.</p>, <p>“Smithant, this might be hard to believe,” she began, “but we aren’t sad that our sister has fallen, we are <em>happy</em>. She wanted this, we all want this, but she <em>succeeded</em>. We want to carry her with us, always, so that we never forget that we can succeed too.”</p>, <p>She stared hard at the smith, trying to help her understand just how important this was to them.</p>, <p>From Smithant’s point of view, they just looked insane. They had compound eyes, they were always looking in all directions, it’s not like they could actually stare at one thing. All Leeroy was doing was leaning uncomfortably close, to the point she might soon catch some red hot tongs in the eye.</p>, <p>“All right, all right! Back up a little would you, you moron! So, what, you want me to encase Cardigant in a… in a what? A box made of metal?”</p>, <p>The Immortals considered it for a long moment.</p>, <p>“A nice box?” one of them suggested from the back.</p>, <p>Smithant glared at them.</p>, <p>“A <em>nice</em> box?” she demanded. “Nice <em>how</em>?”</p>, <p>Another moment of silence.</p>, <p>“It should be decorated…” one of the giant, steel-clad ants offered.</p>, <p>“Maybe… it should look like Cardigant?” another said.</p>, <p>“Maybe some words of encouragement should be put on it? That might be nice.”</p>, <p>“Oh! We could make it portable! We get sent to a lot of different places after all.… I wouldn’t want to leave her behind.”</p>, <p>There was a general chorus of agreement to this.</p>, <p>“Make it so we can mount it on our backs then?”</p>, <p>More agreement.</p>, <p>“Maybe some of those nice vine carvings? They look nice. You know the ones that curl around themselves?”</p>, <p>“Good idea.”</p>, <p>“I like the vines…”</p>, <p>“Very appealing.”</p>, <p>“Anything else?” the smith grated.</p>, <p>Another long pause.</p>, <p>“Maybe some scent baskets, so we can spread messages of comfort when we carry her.”</p>, <p>“Flowers?”</p>, <p>“Put her face on the front?”</p>, <p>“Make sure to include the armour in some way!”</p>, <p>“Oh, yes. The armour is important.”</p>, <p>The Immortals had grown attached to their metal shells after all this time. It was a love/hate relationship, to be sure.</p>, <p>“Some lights? Maybe? Something subtle…”</p>, <p>“It should include her core, obviously.”</p>, <p>“Obviously!”</p>, <p>“We can’t recycle her core!”</p>, <p>A hammer came crashing down on the anvil, silencing all with the resulting clang.</p>, <p>“You want me to <em>enchant</em> it?!” Smithant bellowed, her pheromones blasting away the others’ words in an instant. “Just how much time do you think I have to spare?”</p>, <p>She clacked her mandibles harshly.</p>, <p>“Even the raw materials needed would be <em>immense</em>. There’s no way!”</p>, <p>Leeroy leapt forward and banged her face onto the stone floor, followed by all the others. This was how the humans apologised, apparently.</p>, <p>“Please!” Leeroy begged. “We will help! We’ll source all the materials ourselves. If you do this for us, we’ll never complain about having to wear your armour again. We swear!”</p>, <p>“We swear!” the rest chorused.</p>, <p>Smithant looked out over the hunched forms of the Immortals, irritated beyond words. These idiots took up so much of her time, and were such a pain in her carapace, she almost took a savage glee in making their armour as durable as possible, just to ensure they would survive.</p>, <p>Which… come to think of it… gave her an idea.</p>, <p>“Alright, fine,” she said, “I’ll make your fancy box, with vines and smoke and all the other nonsense. I’ll even make it with the finest materials, the highest quality metal, <em>and</em> I’ll contribute cores to ensure the enchanting works flawlessly. In fact, I’ll do the inscribing myself.”</p>, <p>The Immortals looked up with overflowing joy in their eyes.</p>, <p>“Really?!” Leeroy said.</p>, <p>Smithant nodded.</p>, <p>“Really.”</p>, <p>And she did just what she said. The box she constructed took an absurd amount of effort. Her apprentices worked (almost) around the clock as the entire Immortal battalion scrambled to fetch everything they needed whilst Smithant laboured over an anvil.</p>, <p>The finest layered steel, shaped and decorated with her own expert mandibles. What she built was a wonder of engineering, a majestic feat of skill and craftsmanship that was, ironically, perhaps the finest piece of metalwork in her career to date.</p>, <p>When at last Cardigant’s body was laid to rest and sealed inside, every Immortal turned out to watch the ceremony. The lid closed and locked into place, never to be opened again, then Leeroy stepped forward and placed the celebrated ant's core in the elaborate mount that had been prepared for it.</p>, <p>The second the core clicked in, the enchantments came to life. The Immortals celebrated wildly as they felt the reassurance of their dear, departed sister wash over them.</p>, <p>Smithant snickered.</p>, <p>She just knew those idiots were going to carry that thing into battle. With the myriad of defensive auras she’d packed into the thing, she may just have ensured that none of them would ever get a big fancy box of their own.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“WE ARE BATHED IN HER BENEVOLENT LIGHT!”</p>, <p>“<strong>WE SEEK!</strong>”</p>, <p>“WHERE SHE HAS LED, WE SHALL FOLLOW!”</p>, <p>“<strong>WE SEEK!</strong>”</p>, <p>“ETERNAL REST! ETERNAL GLORY! IT IS NOW HERS! SOON, IT WILL BE OURS!”</p>, <p>“<strong>WE SEEK!</strong>”</p>, <p>The column of Immortals continued to march through the ranks of ants who had parted for them. Towards the front of their formation, the Reliquary of Eternal Rest was borne upon their backs, its sacred smokes infused with pheromonal messages of hope and comfort.</p>, <p>“Death is near! Glory to the Colony! The end has come! Death is near!”</p>, <p>The waves of pheromones rolled over the ants to either side, who rolled their antennae and clacked their mandibles, unimpressed.</p>, <p>Leeroy continued to exhort her followers all the way to the head of the column. By the time they reached the end of the bridge, the Immortals had been whipped into a frenzy, their hearts surging with devotion to the Colony and eyes ablaze with a desperate need to lay down their lives.</p>, <p>The Reliquary had a multiplicative effect on the eagerness of the Immortals. They were so eager to fly into battle their armour rattled on their backs.</p>, <p>Of course, it wasn’t possible. The bridge hadn’t been finished yet.</p>, <p>The steel clad column came to a halt with surprising discipline and the Immortals sat, lowering their bodies down to rest, though, sadly for them, not permanently.</p>, <p>With their shock troops in position, the Colony once more got to work extending the bridge. Earth magic churned once again as thousands of minds linked together to work the energy that suffused the air. The bombardment continued as they worked, but it had become clear that the ka’armodo lacked the firepower to break the Colony’s defences.</p>, <p>The bridge inevitably completed its journey, connecting to the termite mountain and terminating on the shore. The ants looked out over the unbroken fields of white fungus, but there was no sign of their enemy.</p>, <p>Which meant it was fire time.</p>, <p>Leading the fire mages, an ecstatic, almost rapturous Propellant stepped forward.</p>, <p>“Ant mages! Prepare to burn! Burn it all! ALL OF IT TO THE GROUND! AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!”</p>, <p>Fire exploded in all directions, setting the fungal forest ablaze. Huge orbs of pure blue flame were lobbed further up the mountain, starting spot fires that rapidly spread. In a matter of moments a raging inferno blazed across the mountain.</p>, <p>The Immortals braced themselves, waiting for any response from the termites, but none was forthcoming. Which suited Propellant just fine.</p>, <p>“More fire! MORE! IT’S SO BEAUTIFUL!” she raged as she launched more and more flaming missiles deeper into enemy territory.</p>, <p>For over an hour the fire burned, sweeping over the fungus with breathtaking speed. Pillars of flame roared dozens of metres into the air, the ashes burning so hot they started new fires wherever they landed. When the fuel had burned itself out, all that remained was charred ground that still sizzled with remembered heat. In the distance, the smoke still billowed up into the sky, the fungus burning over the horizon.</p>, <p>But the silence was deafening. The Colony had expected to see the enemy boiling out of their tunnels to fight, filled with rage and ready to defend their precious garden. Instead, the mighty column of ants looked out over a barren field, devoid of the foe they sought.</p>, <p>Leeroy stepped forward.</p>, <p>“Let’s go,” she said.</p>, <p>Determined, the Immortals began to march. With luck, none of them would return. The Reliquary of Eternal Rest marched with them, the peaceful gaze of Cardigant upon their every step.</p>, <p>With their heavily armoured shock troops in the lead, the rest of the army followed behind, flowing over the landscape like a natural disaster. The formation continued to be a tight column, the troops on high alert. This was not friendly territory; the ground did not belong to them.</p>, <p>Every lump of dirt, every rock, every smouldering tree could conceal a tunnel or cavern filled with termites. Mages extended their senses as far as they could, even going so far as to harden the ground beneath them as they marched.</p>, <p>Still, the termites did not emerge.</p>, <p>The ka’armodo clearly held their charges on a tight leash. They would hold their monstrous army at bay until the ants had been drawn as far forward as possible.</p>, <p>Despite knowing this, the Colony advanced. Their resolution did not waver. They would see the enemy destroyed here today, regardless of the tricks and stratagems. When the battle was done, one insect would reign supreme.</p>, <p>Tense and alert, the army marched all the way to the mouth of the termite nest itself. Although repairs had been made, signs of the damage caused by the Eldest could still be seen, the horrific power that they had unleashed had scarred the mountain itself.</p>, <p>It was here that the enemy finally made themselves known.</p>, <p>Massed ranks of termites, thousands upon thousands, filled the wide nest entrance. Blind faces and long mandibles rose high as the ants came close enough for them to scent.</p>, <p>On both sides the rage began to build, mandibles clacked with piercing force, the sound echoing off the rock. Neither side could tolerate the other. Neither side <em>would</em> tolerate the other.</p>, <p>When they were a kilometre apart, the Colony came to a halt, the long narrow column beginning to redeploy. Mages continued to firm up the ground and sense whatever they could of the tunnels beneath.</p>, <p>Results were sketchy, they weren’t able to detect anything clearly. The ka’armodo had been busy, working against them to ensure they wouldn’t know where the surprise attack would come.</p>, <p>No matter, this was also within their expectations. In this, the final confrontation, nothing had been left to chance!</p>, <p>The two armies faced each other across the open ground. The ants quivered with excitement, ready to unleash their wrath upon the termite foe.</p>, <p>At the head of the column, the Immortals quivered even more intently, to the point their armour rattled against that of the soldier standing next to them. The constant drum beat of metal on metal filled the air, a deafening din that set every antenna on the mountain to quivering.</p>, <p>“Damn it, Leeroy! Knock it off!” the Eldest complained.</p>, <p>Having completely lost focus at this point, the leader of the steel column took that as instructions to charge.</p>, <p>“LEEEEEEEEROY!” she screamed.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>I really need to mutate my stomach. After powering through the remains of two tier seven demons, I’m absolutely stuffed. Without my capacity upgrades, it would have been impossible to fit them both in. It’s a little saddening that my efficiency upgrades give me absolutely no benefit when eating another monster of my own tier, but such is life. Those mutations exist, but I’ve gotten far more value from my higher Biomass gain from lower tiered food.</p>, <p>As I flop on my side, still surrounded by my gravity domain, I groan and rub at my distended gaster with my back legs.</p>, <p>“Might have gone a little overboard there,” I mumble.</p>, <p>With such Biomass-rich fare on the table before me, it’s not like I could possibly hold back. Like a bloated uncle at Christmas time, I kept going back for more until it was all gone.</p>, <p>As I flop, I idly check on my mana and Altar and am delighted to find that my resources are barely going down at all. With my increased gravity mana generation while using gravity mana, I can sustain the domain almost indefinitely. I will eventually run out, but with this spell alone running, I can sustain it for <em>hours</em>.</p>, <p>There’s enough of the Colony in range to keep the Altar running steady as well. The net result is that I’m able to take some time to digest, undisturbed by the rest of the horde while my three comrades battle fiercely.</p>, <p>It takes them over an hour to finish the fight, but eventually, Tiny, Crinis and Invidia make their way over to me when no more demons remain. Bruised, battered and low on resources, the three of them look absolutely spent.</p>, <p>I stretch my six legs, clean my antennae and stand up.</p>, <p>“Great work, you three!” I congratulate them.</p>, <p>Protectant materialises beside Tiny, looking similarly spent. Her antennae have a definite ‘I’m annoyed at you’ tilt.</p>, <p>“And of course, great work to you twenty as well!” I say enthusiastically. “A hard fought battle is the best way to rank up your Skills and gain experience. You guys may as well bank some Biomass, and then we’ll make our way back to the Colony.”</p>, <p>Looking at the field of carnage around us, there should be plenty for all of them to eat.</p>, <p>“Though, I think you need to move quickly….”</p>, <p>If there’s one thing that isn’t short on the third stratum, it’s hungry mouths. Demon larvae are boiling up from beneath our feet constantly, and they aren’t picky eaters.</p>, <p>Tiny is already shovelling food into his maw, flicking the little demons off his chosen meals with his salami-thick fingers.</p>, <p>After he evolves again, those fingers will need an even larger food item for comparison… ham, maybe?</p>, <p>All of them rush around the field, stuffing their faces as quickly as they can until they’re all full and we depart the field. It’s time to get ourselves back up to the Colony.</p>, <p>Invidia and I lift the group up, since climbing isn’t all that feasible right now. I have to strain much harder than normal, due to all the extra weight we’re carrying, but eventually, we reach the top and crawl into the tunnels.</p>, <p>All of us are feeling lethargic as we digest, so the fighting is sluggish and sloppy to say the least. Thankfully, the demons we meet aren’t the strongest and I can swat them away when they get too close.</p>, <p>When we climb up onto the plains of Leng, I feel a sense of safety roll over me. I wasn’t truly threatened on our hunt, outside of my fight against the tier sevens, but there’s a vast sense of comfort that comes from being back in the lands of my people.</p>, <p>The scent of pheromones is everywhere, trails and markers tingling against my antennae. The Vestibule thunders with energy, the collective will of hundreds of thousands pouring into me in a constant torrent.</p>, <p>[Alright, gang. Let’s chill here and digest for a minute. I might as well do a little mutating while I’m here. Crinis, make sure you’re prepared for emergency shielding.]</p>, <p>[I’m ready, Master.]</p>, <p>[I can always count on you.]</p>, <p>Tiny snorts loudly.</p>, <p>[And you, Tiny.]</p>, <p>Invidia blinks, slowly.</p>, <p>[And you too, of course.]</p>, <p>Geez. Since when were they all so sensitive? Here in the safety of Colony controlled land, and with the dignity preserved by the dedication of my loyal shadow monster, I dive into the menus and see what I’ve got going on.</p>, <p>+35 is the maximum I can manage at my current evolution and I’ve got nothing hitting that prestigious mark at the moment. I think my first order of business should be to ramp up my stomach. After stuffing myself silly, I’m reminded of the importance of ensuring my stomach is as prepared as it can be to accept Biomass.</p>, <p>The question is, what do I improve? So far, I’ve got a combination of capacity increases and penalty reduction mutations. Either one would be an effective choice right now. I mean, it’s hard to go wrong, really. Of the two, the penalty reduction is the most generally applicable, there isn’t always enough food to stretch me to capacity, after all.</p>, <p>I flick through the menu, idly scanning for anything else that might be impactful. I mean, I’ve been through this list a thousand times, so I don’t… really… expect to… find… anything?</p>, <p>What the hell is this stuff?!</p>, <p>There are choices here that I’ve never seen before, I’m sure of it! Why in the hell would new options be popping up now? Some of this stuff looks good, too.</p>, <p>Pocket Dimension stomach, increasing capacity whilst also tucking the stomach away out of the body and in its own space.</p>, <p>Chambered Blitz stomach, adjusting the digestion process to be both faster and more efficient.</p>, <p>Synthesising Stomach Acid, creating additional Biomass from consumed material.</p>, <p>I mean. What the hell?! This stuff is amazing! There’s a host of new options, each with crazy, multi-part effects, or new, more potent applications.</p>, <p>I mean, Synthesising Acid? Does that mean I would be like… partially producing my own Biomass?</p>, <p>Wait. Does this mean there are other, new options for my body parts that are available to mutate to +35? Burning with curiosity, I whip open the menu for my carapace and start flicking through it.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Well…. This is going to be interesting.</p>, <p>As it turns out, there <em>are</em> new mutation options… crazy ones. Holy moly. What’s this all about? Have I ascended to a new stage and at tier seven, you get funky new mutations? Is it the insane level of mana saturation I’ve been living in lately? Is it the Biomass rich diet of more highly evolved monsters?</p>, <p>A combination of all of the above?</p>, <p>Whatever the case, there’s some seriously sweet selections, ripe and ready to be applied to my carapace.</p>, <p>Repelling Carapace - Projects an anti-gravity field around the carapace, pushing foreign objects away.</p>, <p>A literal repellant built into the carapace. It’d be cool, but would likely make it difficult for Crinis to attach herself to me. I don’t think selecting that would be good for my health.</p>, <p>Double Carapace - Thickens the carapace. After multiple selections, this mutation will create a complete second layer of your carapace.</p>, <p>That’s just stupid! Would anything on Pangera be able to get through that?! Not to mention the cost efficiency. This is effectively giving me an entire new carapace without having to spend evolutionary energy on it! That’s just madness!</p>, <p>Trouble is, I’d be way too heavy with that on. My current exo-skeleton weighs tons. I don't mean ‘a lot’, I mean literal tons.</p>, <p>Mana Infused Carapace - Draws in ambient mana to reinforce and thicken the carapace over time.</p>, <p>That is as sweet as blueberry jam. I wouldn’t even have to do anything and the carapace would just strengthen itself. Nice!</p>, <p>I continue to flick through the list, looking at the bevy of new choices and drooling over their incredible effects.</p>, <p>Which to chooooooose? Argh, they’re all so good!</p>, <p>I could, of course, go back to my menus and focus on other things, but now that I’ve seen the incredible power of these new mutation options, I want to get as many as I can.</p>, <p>Eventually, I manage to settle on one that I really like. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw it.</p>, <p>Light Holding Carapace - Uses the power of gravity to slow the light reflected from it.</p>, <p>Just delicious. First, it uses the power of gravity without me having to cast a spell, meaning my carapace will always actively be channelling gravity, secondly, the effect is way too cool.</p>, <p>I’ll be turning myself into a mini-black hole!</p>, <p>What makes a black hole black? Famously, they have such powerful gravity that not even light can escape their grasp! How does an eye work? Light bounces off stuff and enters the eyeball, which the brain then interprets. What this mutation will do, is make it take longer for the light to bounce off me and enter an eye.</p>, <p>Meaning what people will see when they look at me, is literally an afterimage. They’ll be attacking a ghost! Combined with my future-sense and reflexes, I’ll be dodging so quick they won’t even realise they missed before I’m running off somewhere else!</p>, <p>MUAHAHAHAAAAA!</p>, <p>It’s disgusting. It’s so powerful, it makes me feel a little sick inside. I love it.</p>, <p>Of course, with just the one mutation, I won’t be holding onto that light very strongly. The afterimage effect will likely be a tenth of a second, if that. But if I make it to tier eight, or even nine? After doubling down and then enhancing this mutation, it’ll increase the delay. Will it last half a second? Not being able to see me for that long would be insane. I can get a lot done in half a second these days.</p>, <p>Of course, it’s not invincible. This is only effective against enemies with eyes, or who use sight as their primary detection method. Mana senses will still be able to pick me out, but I can influence that with my existing Skills, masking my own mana signature. Other, more esoteric methods will also still work, like heat, or heck, even my own gravity sensitive antennae.</p>, <p>With that selection made, I swap over to my stomach again and keep flicking through until I find an option that I like. As much as I want to muck around with other body parts, the stomach is fundamental, the engine that powers the Biomass industry. It <em>must</em> be next.</p>, <p>Grav-Compression Stomach - Uses powerful muscles infused with gravitic energy to compact food to a smaller size and density. Increases stomach capacity, increases Biomass gain, increases digestion time.</p>, <p>Heck yeah. Oddly enough, this mutation comes with a downside, but I don’t really care about it all that much. I usually feast on the battlefield, which means packing in as much as I can and getting the heck out of dodge. This mutation allows me to pack more in and then get more out of what’s in there.</p>, <p>It’s perfect.</p>, <p>Of course, the next organ to get the +35 treatment is going to be my inner carapace plating. It makes sense to upgrade it and the carapace at the same time.</p>, <p>Just as with everything else, there’s new mutation options available for it once I bring it up to +35. Never-before-seen applications and variations that all do interesting and powerful things.</p>, <p>But I’m not satisfied. If I want to ensure that the Colony is safe against all threats, and if I want to chomp the Ancients down there for putting this hook in me, I can’t be satisfied with immediate boosts. I need something that’s going to get more and more powerful as I evolve. Something that will really shine after I mutate it two or three more times.</p>, <p>My plating already does the job I first purchased it for exceedingly well. It absorbs shocks and impacts, making me extraordinarily resistant to slam attacks and the like, as well as healing any damage my carapace receives from the inside.</p>, <p>It’s amazing!</p>, <p>In addition, it also has the new effect of compressing gravity mana around me, meaning any spell or gravity effect I create gets that little extra boost. That stuff is all amazing, but I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do to enhance the effects of the crystal flesh that my plating is now formed from?</p>, <p>Poking through the list, I eventually find something that I’m happy with.</p>, <p>Crystal Kinetic Displacement - Allows the Crystal Flesh to absorb kinetic energy and then shunt it to a nearby space.</p>, <p>Basically, I can absorb kinetic energy, then blast someone else in the face with it from close range.</p>, <p>These mutations are the best.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Delicious, delicious mutations. Horrible, horrible itch.</p>, <p>How could I describe the itch I experienced when I locked those three in and confirmed them with Gandalf? I’d expected it to be bad, obviously. The moment the wizened, gruff tones of the grey one faded away, I had braced myself for the worst.</p>, <p>It turns out, my understanding of ‘worst’ was appallingly incorrect.</p>, <p>I felt as if my itches had itches of their own. The first itch, unaccustomed to the sensation, took out its rage and discomfort on me, by itching ever harder. My carapace and plating cover my entire body, so this feeling covered every inch of my outside.</p>, <p>The moment it started, Crinis shielded me from the world, and I flung myself to the ground and engaged in a vigorous rolling session. It did not help.</p>, <p>I tried to use mind magic on myself, to overwhelm my senses with false impressions so I couldn’t feel it. That didn’t work either. Ultimately, I was forced to surrender to my fate, and thrash uncontrollably until it was over.</p>, <p>The intensity of the itch is related to the sophistication of the mutation, I’ve known that for a long time. Having my antennae sense the future was a heck of a lot more itchy than having them sense heat. These new mutations are crazy, involving powerful forces and weird dimensional stuff. It stands to reason that having my body change to house these new effects would be an intense experience.</p>, <p>Should have thought of that before I’d done it….</p>, <p>Too late now! Having dealt with that, I check my remaining Biomass and find there isn’t enough for much more significant mutating. I’d love to upgrade my Nave and Altar, but without enough to significantly boost the two of them, I’d run the risk of not properly considering them as a pair.</p>, <p>Better to wait and then mutate the two of them in tandem. The more I use the new Altar, the better I understand what it can do, and what I want it to do better. There’s no rush, especially when I won’t get a second shot at these mutations. The Altar is already made of a top tier material, or at least, as top tier as I can afford. It’s unlikely I’ll ever reset it.</p>, <p>With that done, I race over to the main nest beneath Roklu to have a word with my favourite three rock-coated people in the world. I really need to know what’s up with these funky new options.</p>, <p>[You’re pretty much on the right track,] Granin rumbles, scratching at his cheek with one granite covered finger. [Mana plays a part, Biomass richness plays a part. The main thing is your core. A Mythic core can sustain a more powerful and demanding body than a weaker one. Your monstrous form is constantly absorbing and draining mana in order to keep yourself… doing anything, really. Unlike a natural animal, you’re totally dependent on mana to keep yourself alive. With the abundance of energy flowing through that fancy new core of yours, you can sustain much more demanding mutations.]</p>, <p>[Then why do they only show up at +35?] I demand. [I had the core already, so why couldn’t I pick them from +0?]</p>, <p>[Because only a tier seven monster can get to +35,] Granin harrumphs impatiently. [I can’t explain it any better than that.]</p>, <p>Fair enough I suppose.</p>, <p>[How are you finding your current evolution?] Corun asks, eager, like an eight foot tall, ore covered puppy. [You’re a mythic monster now, so you should notice a significant jump in power.]</p>, <p>I scratch at my head with one antenna.</p>, <p>[I guess so. Using my new… abilities, I’ve been able to fight pretty evenly with the other tier sevens I’ve run into. Though I’m not sure if any of them were mythic.]</p>, <p>[They probably weren’t,] Torrina shakes her head. [Basically every tier eight monster is a mythic, but not many tier sevens are. Without a strong enough core to fuel their evolutions, they end up outpaced and defeated by monsters with more concentrated cores. If they’d had the same level of evolutions as you, then I think you might have found them a little more challenging.]</p>, <p>[How many did you fight out there?] Granin asks, curious. [I’d heard you’d smashed one when rescuing the Queen, but what about on this trip out?]</p>, <p>[Three.]</p>, <p>Granin nods, looking a touch impressed for once.</p>, <p>[I’m surprised you found that many and fought them in one outing. Your evolution is paying dividends already.]</p>, <p>[At once.]</p>, <p>….</p>, <p>He looks up at me. I look down at him.</p>, <p>[What do you mean, ‘at once’?] he growls in my mind.</p>, <p>[What do I mean? Is… is there another meaning to the phrase I’m not aware of? Where are you getting confused?]</p>, <p>[You’re telling me that you fought three tier sevens at once?]</p>, <p>[Yes.]</p>, <p>[Tier seven demons.]</p>, <p>[Yup.]</p>, <p>[And beat them?]</p>, <p>[... Would I be alive if I hadn’t?]</p>, <p>[You could have run away!]</p>, <p>[But then I wouldn’t get to eat them!]</p>, <p>After a moment, Granin manages to calm himself and shares a significant look with the other two. They seem solemn all of a sudden. Dammit. I should have kept my mandibles shut.</p>, <p>[Nope!] I exclaim over the mental link.</p>, <p>[What do you mean, “nope”?] Corun asks, surprised.</p>, <p>[I refuse to be an Ancient, thanks, baiiiiiiiiiii!]</p>, <p>I turn and run. No way, no how am I getting dragged into their shenanigans. All I want to do is keep my family safe. Everything else is meaningless if you ask me.</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>The Cults have competed for thousands of years, attempting to craft the most superior monster, one with the potential to become an Ancient in its own right.</em></p>, <p><em>Such a thing was a dream within a dream, yet it is our purpose. I myself strove for over a century at this very task. I am proud of the work that I did, and the monsters I created were strong, surprising a number of my peers with their capabilities.</em></p>, <p><em>A key argument, and one I have listened to and participated in many times, is which sort of monster makes the best base. Should we be using beast archetypes from the first stratum? Or taking advantage of the many special properties shadow monsters possess? Perhaps demons, with their inherent advantages and mana rich bodies, are a better starting point?</em></p>, <p><em>Ultimately, the discussion boils down to the simple realisation that the deeper in the Dungeon a monster starts, the stronger it is at tier one, and therefore the stronger it will become as it evolves. Therefore, if you aren’t trying to craft an Ancient from the very best materials, ie, the most powerful monster from the deepest layer of the Dungeon you can find, then you are wasting your time.</em></p>, <p><em>Yet I now believe we were chasing shadows. I often considered my peers to be foolish in their beliefs, but I rarely considered the same true of myself.</em></p>, <p><em>The ant, Anthony. From where does he gain his unique strength? What made him such an incredible specimen? </em></p>, <p><em>My theories to this point have been well documented in other places, but now I wonder if there is more to it. Perhaps the act of descending is a key component of his development. Would he have become as strong as he did, if he had not powered down through the layers as he had? </em></p>, <p><em>All monsters are compelled to descend by the increasing demands of their cores, but usually, they would do so slowly, as slowly as they could. Better to dominate the third as a tier seven or even tier eight, holding on as long as possible, only then descending to the fourth in relative safety, than rush headlong into danger.</em></p>, <p><em>Yet Anthony always rushed headlong into danger. He descended too fast, before he was ready.</em></p>, <p><em>The Dungeon rewards such actions. He soaked in more mana, and richer Biomass, at a lower point of evolution than any monster raised by the Cults. I’ve no evidence to back up this theory, but I put it forward nonetheless.</em></p>, <p><em>- From the writings of Granin to the Cult of the Worm.</em></p>, <p>The three golgari shapers stood in silence for a moment as the giant ant rushed into the distance, followed closely by his entourage of overly powerful pets.</p>, <p>It was easy to forget how large Anthony was now. He’d evolved twice since they’d first met him when he was a tier five. Back then, it had been easy for Granin to look him in the eye; the golgari was close to eight feet tall, after all. Now, the ant towered over him, not to mention his length, which vastly outstripped his height.</p>, <p>“Did he say what I think he said?” Corun wondered.</p>, <p>“He must have had help,” Torrina said hesitantly. “With Tiny and the others, he would’ve been able to fight on par with three tier sevens….”</p>, <p>Granin shook his head.</p>, <p>“Not here. Let’s get back inside and discuss in the office.”</p>, <p>The Colony was understandably sensitive about their Eldest. He and his triad were tolerated because Anthony confided in them and because they provided a valuable service, sharing their research and knowledge freely with the ants. But standing out in the open and running their mouths about Anthony would be a severe faux pas.</p>, <p>The three made their way inside in silence, moving through the wondrous, carved halls and impossibly graceful stairs until they reached their allocated rooms toward the top of the nest.</p>, <p>“I still don’t know why they worked so hard on this section,” Torrina shook her head, “the ants themselves basically never see it.”</p>, <p>Granin shrugged, but Corun agreed with her.</p>, <p>“I’ve seen the interior sections they use. They’re nowhere near this elaborate.”</p>, <p>The outer layers of this nest had been built for… non-ants. Humans and humanoids, as well as one portion designed with the ka’armodo in mind… just in case. The craftants had lavished the many floors set aside for anyone else to use with the very best of their attention. It was ridiculous that they even had artisans with the Skills to produce such works. They hadn’t even been alive that long!</p>, <p>They filed into their office and Granin closed the polished wooden door behind them.</p>, <p>“If he’d had help, or relied on the other three to help him, he would have said so straight away,” Granin declared firmly.</p>, <p>The other two considered for a moment, then nodded. If he could divert the attention or acclaim onto someone else, then he surely would at the very first opportunity. They’d known Anthony long enough to understand that.</p>, <p>“Which means….” Corun led.</p>, <p>“That he fought three other tier seven monsters, demons, and defeated them in battle, at the same time, by himself.”</p>, <p>Which was… absurd.</p>, <p>“That’s… not how it works,” Torrina said hesitantly.</p>, <p>None of them believed the giant ant had been lying to them, though, so obviously, it <em>did</em> work that way. They just didn’t understand <em>how</em>. They’d determined that ants reaching higher tiers were rewarded with powerful evolutions, but they were still handicapped. The boost they received from their above average evolutions should have helped to even the playing field, not let them blow straight past the competition.</p>, <p>“I’d projected Anthony to start pushing ahead of his peers in another evolution, maybe two,” Granin said slowly. “With the bonuses he’s been stacking up, and the rare mutations he’s obviously been taking, it hasn’t taken nearly that long. He’s already a powerful mythic monster and he’s not even tier eight.”</p>, <p><em>Yet</em>.</p>, <p>“If he can do this now. What will he be able to do then?” Corun wondered.</p>, <p>The three let their imaginations run wild for a moment before Granin called their attention back.</p>, <p>“Things are starting to accelerate out of control,” Granin said. “Anthony is a candidate for the twentieth Ancient. He has the potential, he has the backing, and he has the approval of the Ancients themselves, evidenced by the Call. He’s already become something extraordinary.”</p>, <p>“We need to inform the Cult,” Torrina said.</p>, <p>Corun hesitated.</p>, <p>“Are you sure that’s wise? Wouldn’t we be betraying Anthony’s trust if we start advertising his strength all over Pangera?”</p>, <p>“We’re likely already too late for that,” Granin remarked drily. “Our scaly friend is likely to have informed the Red Truth the moment he got home. But that’s irrelevant,” he waved a hand to brush off that concern. “The stronger he grows, the more danger he will be in. The Cults can help alleviate that. We are all over the world, after all. A monster with this kind of potential only comes around every few hundred years. We need to ensure we put all of our resources behind him.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“Do you really think the ants are protecting us because the Great One approves of our holy pilgrimage?” Alis wondered.</p>, <p>Jern looked at the ranks of ants marching alongside them, guarding the pilgrims on both sides.</p>, <p>“I think… they probably just came along to make sure we’re safe,” he suggested.</p>, <p>His friend looked up at him irritably.</p>, <p>“That’s all? Priest Beyn says it because they are guiding us along our blessed path and into enlightenment.”</p>, <p>“All they really do is fight Dungeon monsters for us,” Jern pointed out.</p>, <p>Alis scowled.</p>, <p>“Sometimes we have to fight for ourselves, don’t we?”</p>, <p>He sighed and hefted the oversized axe on his shoulder. Surprisingly, an ant had given it to him, which had caused people to whisper and point. Eventually, he’d found a mage, (who <em>did</em> turn to keep him in front of her, which he tested by taking a few steps to either side), who’d explained that, since he was so large and strong, they’d made a weapon he could use to help protect the pilgrims.</p>, <p>“Yes, sometimes we have to fight for ourselves,” he told his red haired friend. “Your fire magic has improved a lot since we left.”</p>, <p>She folded her arms across her chest.</p>, <p>“Of course!” she declared, puffing herself up with pride. “I’ve had the chance to turn my flames on Dungeon monsters before. It’s only natural that my Levels are increasing quickly.”</p>, <p>Jern had to agree. Fighting against monsters really was Levelling him quickly. It wouldn’t be that long before his Class maxed out and he’d need to change it into a new one.</p>, <p>“Still,” he said, turning back to look at the long train of pilgrims behind them, “I never expected we would gather this many people.”</p>, <p>“You really doubted how persuasive priest Beyn can be?” Alis scoffed. “Every place we go, we end up with more and more followers. I feel like we got a thousand at Rylleh alone.”</p>, <p>“Good thing the ants are feeding us,” Jern noted.</p>, <p>“Of course! The Great One is with us!”</p>, <p>The young man scratched at his cheek and said nothing. He wasn’t particularly smart, so he was probably wrong, but he figured the Great One was just making sure they didn’t starve to death, rather than urging them onwards.</p>, <p>Not that it really mattered, he was enjoying himself and Alis was having a great time, so he didn’t have any reason to turn around and go back.</p>, <p>“Do you think this next city will be as welcoming as the last?”</p>, <p>“Why wouldn’t they be? We are coming on a holy pilgrimage! They’ve got no reason to turn us back.”</p>, <p>“But… isn’t this city <em>outside</em> of the Colony’s territory?”</p>, <p>“So? The light of the Great One is universal! I’m sure it’ll be fine.”</p>, <p>He turned and looked at the ants around them. <em>They</em> certainly didn’t seem to be as relaxed as Alis, constantly on alert, with messengers running up and down the column at all times. Suddenly, two of the nearby soldiers turned toward a patch on the wall, their mandibles flexing as they readied themselves. He stepped toward them without hesitation.</p>, <p>When they looked up at him, he tapped himself on the chest.</p>, <p>“Allow me,” he said.</p>, <p>They couldn’t understand his words, but they knew what he was getting at, and stepped back a fraction. Jern hefted the massive axe off his shoulder and gave it a few swings to warm up his arms, then he waited.</p>, <p>A minute later, a frenzied, mad-eyed beast lunged from the wall, spraying the young man with stone fragments. He got a flash of fur, and claws, and a red maw before he completed his swing, smashing his axe deep into the beast.</p>, <p>With a wrench, he pulled his weapon free and stared down at the monster. When he was sure it wasn’t moving, he turned to the soldiers, gave a dip of his head, which they returned with their antennae, and then jogged back up the line to catch up with Alis, leaving the soldiers to their meal.</p>, <p>“The ants can take care of that, you know. If anything, you’re just taking experience away from them.”</p>, <p>Jern rolled his shoulders uncomfortably.</p>, <p>“It must be hard shepherding this many humans through the Dungeon during a wave. I just feel like we should help out as much as we can.”</p>, <p>Alis opened her mouth to reply, thought for a second, then closed it.</p>, <p>“You’re right,” she begrudgingly admitted. “I’ll get the next one.”</p>, <p>~~~</p>, <p>“Greetings, young ones,” Beyn greeted them as he made his way to their fire. “Another hard day following the Divine Path has come to an end. I hope I find you well.”</p>, <p>Jern ducked his head in acknowledgement as the priest approached, holy antennae bobbing on the top of his robe. Alis beamed with excitement, clasping her hands together.</p>, <p>“It was fine, thank you, priest Beyn. We did our best to help protect the column and even supported the soldiers as they fought Dungeon spawns.”</p>, <p>“Yes, our friends informed me of how helpful you two were today,” the priest gestured with his one remaining hand toward the ants, still on duty alongside them. “They are grateful for your assistance. It has been very difficult for them to protect us along this journey, given the state of the Dungeon. I fear we must step up and do more to defend ourselves if we are to make it to the journey’s end.”</p>, <p>Alis surged to her feet.</p>, <p>“Not to worry, priest Beyn! We are more than happy to do our part. Aren’t we, Jern?”</p>, <p>Surprised at being suddenly included, all the young man could do was nod, jerkily.</p>, <p>Beyn laughed warmly.</p>, <p>“With brave souls like you amongst us, my heart is put to ease. Tomorrow we will reach our current destination, and I hope we will be well received, but we must be prepared to be rebuffed. We are outside the lands of the Colony at this moment, and the citizens of Torpin’s Rest are not obliged to take us in.”</p>, <p>“The Great One will persuade them,” Alis gushed, “I’m <em>sure</em> of it!”</p>, <p>“Your faith is strong,” Beyn beamed at her. “But the Great One may see this as a trial for us to overcome. In any case, I thank you for the warmth of your fire, but I must be off.”</p>, <p>They thanked him for his time, but the priest was already moving, walking down the column toward the next fire. He would greet every pilgrim before the night was done, as he did every night.</p>, <p>“He’s incredible,” Alis sighed.</p>, <p>Jern nodded. He really was.</p>, <p>~~~</p>, <p>Jern winced and Alis bristled by his side, ready to explode, and he felt similar anger boiling from the pilgrims around him, but priest Beyn remained calm.</p>, <p>“Peace, friends,” he said, his sonorous voice rolling over the gathered pilgrims along with the force of armed guards who had greeted them outside the gate of Torpin’s Rest. “We are on a holy pilgrimage and have no desire to anger or quarrel with the people of your city. We simply –”</p>, <p>“Good,” bellowed the man leading the procession from the Dungeon city, draped in his purple robes of office. “Then take your filthy insect masters and leave this place! You are unwanted, heathen monster-worshippers, and the sight of you soils my eyes!”</p>, <p>Jern blinked. He felt that was uncalled for. Alis nearly exploded.</p>, <p>“There is no need for this disrespect,” Beyn said smoothly, but Jern thought he may have detected a slight hitch in his tone. “The Colony are a holy miracle who have saved and uplifted our people. I beg you, do not disparage them, for they have done nothing to you.”</p>, <p>“And they never will,” the man snorted. “Everyone knows the ants are too scared to approach Torpin’s Rest, for they fear our righteous fury! We walk on the true Path, and won’t bow to these <em>pathetic </em>creatures. Now, if you can find what is left of your spine, turn yourself around and LEAVE. You are not welcome here, and never will be!”</p>, <p>Jern thought he saw Beyn’s eye twitching, but the priest retained his calm. He turned to the pilgrims and spoke to them soothingly.</p>, <p>“We will leave this place in peace,” he said. “Let us depart.”</p>, <p>“Yes,” sneered the official. “Cowards all of you, just like your ‘Great One’. If that pathetic beast showed its face here, we would smash it beneath our shoes like the bug it is!”</p>, <p>Beyn’s calm expression twisted in an instant.</p>, <p>Jern sighed and picked up his axe, rolling his shoulders. Somehow, he’d thought this might happen.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“We didn’t really <em>mean</em> to burn Torpin’s rest,” Alis protested. “People just got a bit carried away.”</p>, <p>“We were lucky the Colony was there to keep casualties to a minimum and help rebuild. Things could have gotten very nasty,” Jern said.</p>, <p>“They provoked us!”</p>, <p>The gentle giant next to her frowned.</p>, <p>“Just because someone teases me, doesn’t mean I should punch them in the face. You’re the one who told me that.”</p>, <p>“That’s… true. Of course that’s true. But they shouldn’t have said anything about the Great One!”</p>, <p>Jern thought for a while and then nodded. There hadn’t been any need to insult their saviour like that. It was almost as if the leader of Torpin’s Rest <em>wanted</em> to provoke them.</p>, <p>He stepped over a pile of rubble, and extended a hand to Alis, which she grasped as she clambered over it.</p>, <p>“Then what about Deepward?” he asked.</p>, <p>His friend released his hand and brushed off her dress, trying to pat away the dust and ash.</p>, <p>“Deepward was… a lapse in judgement. I think people were just excited after Torpin’s Rest.”</p>, <p>“Priest Beyn tried to stop them….”</p>, <p>“They really should have listened,” Alis groused. “Deepward wasn’t <em>that</em> rude to us. Still, a little more manners and…”</p>, <p>“And we wouldn’t have burned their city to the ground?”</p>, <p>“Yes… that.”</p>, <p>They came across several ants struggling to shift a beam of charred wood, carvers, judging by the size, so Jern put down his axe and helped them to lift, freeing it from the crumbling bricks that weighed it down. They waggled their antennae at him in gratitude and he smiled back before he picked up his axe and continued to walk.</p>, <p>“At least they were a lot more welcoming when we got to Jagtown,” Alis said firmly, “they let us in, Beyn preached, we rested and then left peacefully.”</p>, <p>“I think they were really scared,” Jern observed, remembering. “People in Jagtown really seemed to want to avoid me. More than usual, I mean.”</p>, <p>As big as he was, people tended to avoid him at the best of times.</p>, <p>Alis sniffed.</p>, <p>“Well, if a little fear is what it takes to bring out some good manners and hospitality, then that says a lot more about them than it does about us!”</p>, <p>He supposed there was some truth to that. If the pilgrims had received a normal welcome, then none of this would have happened. He wondered if the hostile reaction they got was due to the pilgrims, or perhaps because these smaller cities were extremely paranoid living right on the edges of the Colony’s territory.</p>, <p>Having such an enormous and prosperous nest of monstrous ants <em>right</em> next to your city probably wasn’t great for your nerves. In some ways, it might have been better if the Colony had just conquered them so they could find out everything was fine and just relax.</p>, <p>“Then we got here, to Blackrock.”</p>, <p>Jern kicked a rock. It skittered across what remained of the shattered street and came to rest against the face of a statue commemorating the mining city’s founder. Some pilgrims had pulled it down during the siege.</p>, <p>“Okay, <em>this</em> one is <em>definitely</em> not our fault!” Alis proclaimed, jabbing him in the chest with one finger. “We were super nice. We didn’t show up with any ants. We kept most of the pilgrims <em>well</em> back from the gates. Beyn did everything he could to appear non-threatening and harmless. How can anyone blame us for…” she waved a hand at the ruined city around them, “... what happened?”</p>, <p>She wasn’t <em>completely </em>wrong, as Jern saw it. Beyn, the ants, and the pilgrims had decided that getting into spiritual disagreements and burning down cities was not what the pilgrimage was about, so they’d made every effort to minimise the chances of something going wrong. Every effort to avoid offence, or the appearance of threat had been taken.</p>, <p>Yet the people of Blackrock really, <em>really</em> didn’t want them nearby. Which was fine. If they’d just said so, then Jern was pretty sure the pilgrims would have turned around and kept moving.</p>, <p>But they didn’t just say so. They hung banners on their walls mocking the Colony. They sang songs making fun of Beyn, of the pilgrims and the Great One. If that had been all, it might have been alright, maybe. When the delegation of Blackrock said regretful things about the <em>Queen</em>…</p>, <p>Beyn had been forced to let the pilgrims loose on the city. If the <em>ants</em> had found out what was said…. Jern didn’t want to think about it.</p>, <p>He looked over the smoking ruins of Blackrock. Once a large and industrious mining town, now a blasted crater.</p>, <p>“I think we did something good here,” he decided, kicking another rock.</p>, <p>Alis nodded firmly.</p>, <p>“I’m glad you agree. We should probably head back to the others. Priest Beyn is probably close to finishing his sermon.”</p>, <p>The two wandered back toward the gathering, and indeed, Beyn was in full sonorous swing, preaching his heart out to the huddled and shivering residents of this once-proud city.</p>, <p>“A better life awaits you now!” he proclaimed. “Living in the light of truth, protected, sheltered, by the mighty carapace of the Colony. You will think back on this day and remember it fondly as the day your lives changed forever. For the better! And any who wish to join us on our holy pilgrimage are more than welcome. The time of the Great One’s ascendance draws ever nearer!”</p>, <p>The ants were already helping to rebuild, setting up a defensive perimeter to defend against the wave and settling in for the long haul. Eventually, more ants would come to join their column to make up for those who stayed behind.</p>, <p>And some people would join them too. Jern wasn’t sure why, but some always did. He could see it in the crowd already. A few shining eyes here and there, some ecstatic gazes filled with wonder. Those people would leave behind everything they had ever known and join the pilgrims in their long march into the depths.</p>, <p>“I just hope we don’t burn any more cities down,” Jern sighed.</p>, <p>He didn’t like the smoke.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was strange to be able to <em>smell</em> death. It seemed like the sort of thing that shouldn’t <em>have</em> a smell. Sure, things like decay and rot, they had a distinct scent, an extremely potent one, but those were distinct from death itself. A function of death, in a way. When a person died in front of you, or around you, there wasn’t a discernible odour, as far as Jern could tell. It wasn’t like the soul leaving the body was something his nose could detect.</p>, <p>Yet, as he stood on the precipice of the second stratum of the Dungeon, he could <em>smell death.</em></p>, <p>He didn’t like it.</p>, <p>“It’s so cold,” Alis shivered as she stood by his side, looking down into the slowly stirring darkness.</p>, <p>“It’s going to be colder once we get down there,” he said.</p>, <p>“I don’t want to think about it. At least it’s supposed to get warmer once we reach the third.”</p>, <p>From what he’d heard, Jern wasn’t confident she would enjoy that heat much more than the cold. He’d conversed with a few ants from the next two layers, and it seemed to him that neither were all that hospitable. Only when they reached the fourth would they find a climate they would consider suitaboe for life.</p>, <p>“I never thought I’d be standing here,” he noted aloud.</p>, <p>Alis looked at him, and then back down the sharply sloped tunnel. The border between the first and second lay before them, a sharp border in the Dungeon. To both of them, it looked like a cloud of ink that revolved almost imperceptibly, a dark pond he could toss a stone into. After a moment, he shrugged, picked up a small shard of rock and lobbed it forward, gently, just a couple of metres.</p>, <p>As it fell into the ‘pond’, the flat surface didn’t ripple, it wasn’t disturbed in any way, and the sound of the rock hitting the tunnel floor reached him a second later, muffled.</p>, <p>“What did you do that for?” Alis asked.</p>, <p>“I was curious,” Jern defended himself.</p>, <p>“And what if some nasty shadow beast lunges up out of there and rips your head off?” she scolded him. “You’ve got to be more careful!”</p>, <p>Jern idly considered telling her he was much better at killing monsters than she was, but decided against it at the last minute. Alis didn’t particularly enjoy being reminded of that.</p>, <p>“We should probably head back,” he told her. “Beyn told us we shouldn’t be out here too long.”</p>, <p>“Good idea.”</p>, <p>The camp wasn’t far away, constructed in a large cavern formed from the intersection of multiple tunnels. A common phenomenon, he was told. Passages between strata were much rarer than regular tunnels, so there was often a convergence when one was around.</p>, <p>Walls formed of hardened stone were patrolled by armed pilgrims, hundreds of them at a time, and the ants swept the surrounding Dungeon on a never ending cycle. Even so, the effects of the wave were impossible to ignore. Monsters would burst out of the ground inside the camp at all hours; one even emerged from just under the wall, collapsing a wide stretch as it forced itself free.</p>, <p>Still, the pilgrims banded together and fought them off as best they could. It was probably a good thing they’d been doing so much fighting recently. Pretty much everyone was getting used to swinging some sort of weapon around.</p>, <p>Even the old ladies.</p>, <p>Jern and Alis waved to the guards, who let them in without fuss, then made their way towards the back of the camp, where it butted against the cavern wall. They found Beyn not far away, talking with a large group by a crackling fire.</p>, <p>“We must remain here for at least a week,” Beyn insisted. “Your devotion is to your credit, Sister Myra, but I will not have members of this pilgrimage lost unnecessarily.”</p>, <p>“Won’t the Great One protect us from the Dungeon Sickness?” the grey haired woman demanded. “Everyone is certain our lack of symptoms can be attributed to the protection of the holy carapace.”</p>, <p>“The Great One has stretched forth their mandibles to shield us from much harm, of that I have no doubt,” Beyn agreed, “but for other trials, we are expected to carry the burdens ourselves. The mana thickens precipitously as we descend, and were we to advance to the Shadow Sea without tempering ourselves, then many of us would falter. It takes time, time we can use to reflect and meditate on our profound journey.”</p>, <p>Myra didn’t look like she much agreed with him until his final words. Perhaps she liked the idea of reflection and meditation since it sounded holy enough for her liking. She thanked the priest for his time and moved away, much of the crowd going with her.</p>, <p>The two young pilgrims approached and Beyn smiled at them.</p>, <p>“Ah, Alis and Jern, how fare you today?”</p>, <p>“Fine, father,” Alis gushed. “We were just outside the camp looking at the tunnel down. Are we really going to have to wait a week before we can descend?”</p>, <p>The priest looked grave and nodded.</p>, <p>“Yes, I’m afraid we must. Even more may be necessary, though I hope that isn’t the case. The devotion of these people burns strong, and I would hate to force them to delay on their holy journey. Dungeon sickness is a very real and truly dangerous concern. There are many in the camp who have been suffering silently. Were it not for the aid of our ant sisters, then I’m afraid hundreds, maybe more, would have fallen already.”</p>, <p>He looked to his right, where the ants had dug out a large space from the cavern wall and created a low-mana zone within. All of them had been expected to spend time inside, slowly letting the mana in their bodies out, then stepping back outside. By filling and emptying themselves of mana, they would gradually adapt.</p>, <p>“You and I are probably due to go back in, Alis,” Jern told her.</p>, <p>She huffed at him and then tried to cover it with a cough, not wanting to appear difficult in front of the priest. Then he remembered something.</p>, <p>“Oh, Beyn,” he said, “I need to advance my Class and I thought I should do it today. I was hoping you could advise me?”</p>, <p>The one armed man smiled and brushed at his robe.</p>, <p>“Why of course, I would be delighted to. That has long been my calling, after all.”</p>, <p>“C-can I get your advice as well then, Priest Beyn?” Alis squeaked.</p>, <p>“You need not ask. My knowledge is always available to my brothers and sisters in the faith. Please, tell me of your builds so far.”</p>, <p>There wasn’t much to tell, Jern was still, at this point, a simple Labourer, and Alis had been a Mage Apprentice, the most basic of the introductory mage classes.</p>, <p>The priest nodded thoughtfully as if this was all deep and interesting information.</p>, <p>“And what sort of Classes do you have available for the change?” he said.</p>, <p>Jern had some interesting choices, probably based on the more militaristic Skill levels he’d been gaining. Things like ‘Soldier’, ‘Bruiser’, ‘Axe Wielder’.</p>, <p>“Oh, there’s something weird here,” he said. “What’s a… ‘Templar of the Great One Initiate’? I don’t think I’ve heard of that one.”</p>, <p>“Oh,” Alis said, “I have that too. Have you… heard of… that? Beyn?”</p>, <p>The priest's eyes were bulging from his head and Jern thought he might be starting to froth at the mouth.</p>, <p>“A MIRACLE!” he roared.</p>]\n",

Historically, their people lived in or around freshwater sources outside the Dungeon, and the more peace-loving amongst them still do.</em></p>, <p><em>Within the fourth, however, is where the majority of the brathian of Pangera now make their homes.</em></p>, <p><em>- Excerpt from ‘On the People of the Fourth’ by Tir</em></p>, <p>The crushing pressure of the waters abated as Theraz slipped within the pearlescent barrier erected by his people. Knotted muscles loosened and tension drained from his scales as he smiled for what felt like the first time in weeks.</p>, <p>In reality, it had only been a day or two, but the extra life mana thanks to the wave seemed to press in on him. The waters of the Endless Lake were vibrant, filled with energy and life, but the mana was so <em>thick</em>. When he swam, he felt as if the weight of the mountains that towered in the sky above was pressing down on him.</p>, <p>The added weight of the unending tide of monsters did nothing to help the feeling abate.</p>, <p>“Welcome home, Theraz. How did you find the current?”</p>, <p>“Piris, I should have known you would be waiting for me.”</p>, <p>“Of course, I would not want you to lose yourself amongst the fish and become confused.”</p>, <p>“Do I look like a fish to you?”</p>, <p>“Am I supposed to answer that?”</p>, <p>His cousin grinned at him mischievously and Theraz shook his head.</p>, <p>“I have returned from an important scouting mission for the Satrap, and you wait for me here on the border of our lands simply to throw insults?” he shook his golden-scaled head. “What will your mother say?”</p>, <p>She shrugged, her legs drifting as the waters shifted.</p>, <p>“What does she always say? ‘You need to do better! Stop wasting your time! Cease flapping your fins!’ I don’t listen anymore.”</p>, <p>This was a little disturbing to hear. Had his aunt and cousin really fallen out so badly? He’d had no idea.</p>, <p>“Let us not talk of this anymore,” he cut off the conversation. “I must return to speak with your father, and I do not wish to hear any more of this familial disrespect.”</p>, <p>Piris frowned but fell silent as the two swam close to the sandy bottom, darting between the lush plant life and drifting weeds as they moved deeper into the water claimed by the brathian.</p>, <p>Soon they came across the outer farms, tall fields of hornwart and lotus stretching high above.</p>, <p>Patrols of soldiers swam in organised lines, ever vigilant for monsters spawning within the barrier or for those crazed beasts who pushed through the siren song and attacked.</p>, <p>Beyond the farmland, they came upon Crelios proper, dome-shaped houses made of sandstone, neat gardens and enormous corals. Small fish ducked and darted everywhere, hiding in sponges embedded in roofs and walls. The brathian were everywhere, their vibrant scales of many hues glittering in the dim, shifting light. In the distance, the heart of the city loomed, towering sand structures rising from the lakebed, along with the enormous sponge fronds that rose hundreds of metres towards the light.</p>, <p>“We should pick up the pace a little,” he suggested, “I don’t want to keep your father waiting.”</p>, <p>His cousin nodded, and the water began to twist in front of them as they employed their mana. Soon, they were rocketing through the lake, a short jetstream swirling behind them. They only slowed as they approached the outer reaches of the city centre and were approached by the guards.</p>, <p>“Theraz! Finally back, I see. I was worried we were going to get sent out to find you soon.”</p>, <p>The old brathian lowered his spear and indicated the dull, faded sheen of the scales on his arms.</p>, <p>“I’m getting too old to go beyond the boundary, it’s a good thing you found your way back.’</p>, <p>“You're as impressive a beast as I’ve ever seen in the Endless Lake,” Theraz grinned. “I can’t imagine a day when Mozla the magnificent will be forced to retirement.”</p>, <p>“Then you lack imagination.”</p>, <p>The old warrior turned to the guards on patrol with him.</p>, <p>“You two escort the young master and mistress back to the palace. I’ll finish up out here.”</p>, <p>“Not keen to visit the palace again, Mozla?” Theraz chuckled.</p>, <p>The old man made a face.</p>, <p>“I hate that place,” he said flatly, and Piris stared at him in surprise. He noticed and grunted. “I’m too old for them to bother punishing me for my disrespect, little one. There are a few advantages to being a grey-scale like me. It’s not your family that flaps my fins anyway. There’s just too much… faffing about. I feel like someone has to announce you before you can enter the toilet.”</p>, <p>She giggled.</p>, <p>“That’s almost true. For mother and father, at least.”</p>, <p>“Good. Now hurry up, I need to get back to work.”</p>, <p>Theraz was made to reflect on Mozla’s opinion as he spent the next two hours being passed between dignitaries (each of whom required that he be announced before being permitted to enter their presence). Access to the Satrap wasn’t easy, even for his nephew. When he finally made it through to the inner palace, he’d begun to yearn for the open waters beyond the barrier again.</p>, <p>“Young Theraz, my nephew. Welcome!”</p>, <p>Satrap Umizan was… on the large side… for a brathian. Considering he spent all day lounging on his throne while dealing with administrative affairs, it was somewhat to be expected. The endless supply of sweetfish brought to him by his female attendants didn’t help either.</p>, <p>“Father! You promised you’d stop snacking this week!” Piris scolded him.</p>, <p>“Oh! Piris! I… didn’t see you there!”</p>, <p>The Satrap attempted to hide a plate of fish behind his throne with one hand and failed spectacularly.</p>, <p>“Don’t tell your mother….”</p>, <p>She narrowed her eyes and folded her arms across her chest.</p>, <p>“Please?”</p>, <p>“Satrap,” Theraz grinned, “I have returned from my scouting mission at the forward enclave. There is much for us to discuss.”</p>, <p>At once, Umizan’s demeanour changed and he straightened on his throne, a cold light gleaming in his eye.</p>, <p>“Good.

However, I really didn’t expect something like <em>this</em>.</p>, <p>Marzban roars something and the whole ship changes.</p>, <p>The boat rattles with brathian feet pounding on the wooden deck.</p>, <p>[There’s going to be a fight, let me down!

Obviously, I’m not an expert when it comes to siege weaponry or anything, but I don’t <em>think</em> this is going to hit us.</p>, <p>Ultimately, it doesn’t matter, as the brathian mages get together and blast it out of the sky, sending a shower of stone shards crashing into their hastily raised shields.</p>, <p>[Need any help?] I ask the brathian warrior.</p>, <p>[What can you do in this situation?] he asks tersely.</p>, <p>He’s not being rude or anything, he just genuinely wants to know.</p>, <p>[I can catch the rocks in the air and float them away from the fleet, but I suspect they aren’t trying to hit us anyway.]</p>, <p>He turns to me with a brow raised, light glittering off the scales on his bare arms.</p>, <p>[You sure about that?]</p>, <p>[Nope, but look at the trajectory of this next one.

Shifting my head slightly I take a better look at the Legion fleet behind me. Right now, they don’t appear to be doing anything, but if things devolve any further, they might launch an attack.</p>, <p>This tale has been unlawfully lifted without the author's consent. Report any appearances on Amazon.</p>, <p>I might as well take control of the situation.</p>, <p>With a flex of my will, I begin to pull in vast amounts of mana, channelling it through a gravity magic construct in a furious torrent of power. With the resulting energy, I start to weave, utilising dozens of my mind constructs to compress the energy and shape it into the spell I desire.</p>, <p>As the enormous boulder reaches the peak of its arc and begins to descend, I judge the distance carefully and prepare to release my spell.</p>, <p>[I’ll take care of it,] I tell Marzban, and unleash the magic.</p>, <p>Infused with power from my Altar, the sheer raw energy that floods out of my monstrous form is shocking, an invisible shockwave that radiates upwards. Hundreds of metres overhead, a gravity well snaps into being, catching the offending boulder in its irresistible grip.</p>, <p>It doesn’t take much to redirect the boulder once I’ve got it under my influence. I spend a bit of energy to slingshot it around my well and it catapults harmlessly off to the side.</p>, <p>[I’m kind of surprised that they defend themselves by flinging rocks at people,] I remark to Marzban. [It’s not like there aren’t more impressive options available to us than that.]</p>, <p>The martial leader of the brathian expedition hardens his expression as he continues to stare at the mountain before us, watching for any sign of another projectile.</p>, <p>[Don’t underestimate them,] he warns me. [This time, it was only simple rocks, but they can throw far more deadly things than that, and much further than you might expect. Greystone is known as an impenetrable fortress for good reason.]</p>, <p>Living up to its name, the mountain in front of us is indeed formed of grey stone, with little green life marking its rocky cliffs, as one would expect to see here in the fourth. That’s not the only modification that the golgari went and made to this particular mountain.</p>, <p>Far from it.</p>, <p>More than any other mountain I’ve seen on this stratum, Greystone is <em>massive</em>. Rather than doing the normal thing one would expect a mountain to do, which is get smaller the taller it gets, Greystone is almost a pillar, rising up in a near straight line from the water’s edge, right up to the top, where it touches the bottom of the third.</p>, <p>Now, I don’t need to be told this isn’t natural. The mountains on the fourth aren’t formed this way, which means they changed the shape of the mountain manually, conjuring up new stone using mana. Perhaps that doesn’t sound impressive, the Colony could do the same thing, but staring up at the absurd reality of Greystone, and its sheer, unimaginable <em>weight</em>, really drives home just how much of an effort it would have been.</p>, <p>We are talking about BILLIONS of cubic metres of stone. BILLIONS. Maybe more than that! These mountains already made everything I’d ever seen back on Earth look tiny, but this is absurd! It’s like they created a second Everest and then moulded it around the original Everest!</p>, <p>The sheer amount of magical energy that was poured into this, the boggling amount of stone shaping work that would have required…. It must have taken them hundreds, perhaps as many as a thousand, years.</p>, <p>Honestly, the Colony would <em>never</em> do something like this, because we would consider it a waste of effort and energy.</p>, <p>For whatever reason, the golgari didn’t feel that way. They wanted to make a statement, and they succeeded. It’s impressive as heck.</p>, <p>As we continue to sail towards this absurd pillar of stone, there are no further incidents, thank Gandalf. That doesn’t mean the tension is gone, though. Eran is <em>furious</em>.</p>, <p>It doesn’t bode well for our stay amongst the people of stone.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>[A training drill gone wrong! Of all the absurd claims to make! How dare they treat the Conglomerate this way? I’ll set an embargo on them, I’ll establish tariffs. They won’t be able to import a wheel of cheese when I’m done with them!]</p>, <p>Eran is <em>seriously</em> upset at the treatment she’s received from the golgari. She just returned to the fleet after heading ashore to negotiate the terms of our stay, and to demand an explanation for the giant rocks that flew our way.</p>, <p>It would appear she isn’t satisfied with the response.</p>, <p>[I warned you they wouldn’t be friendly. Relations between us and the golgari are probably worse than those between us and the ka’armodo. Would I describe it as open warfare? Not really. But it’s close.]</p>, <p>She stares up at me and points an accusatory finger.</p>, <p>[Whatever their attitude towards you, it shouldn’t matter because they aren’t hosting the Colony, they are hosting the Brathian Island Conglomerate! As a premier trading and merchant cooperative, we have agreements with every major power in the fourth stratum. And they <em>agreed</em> that we would be allowed to come here!]</p>, <p>[Did you tell them you’d be bringing ten thousand ants along for the ride?]</p>, <p>[Of course we did!] she throws her arms up, still visibly furious. [Trying to conceal that sort of information would have led to a disaster. They’ve been <em>perfectly</em> aware of who would be part of this trade mission.]</p>, <p>That doesn’t mean they didn’t plan on being hostile when we got here…. I don’t bother to point it out to Eran, I’m sure she’s perfectly aware. Part of her anger is probably because she realised this exact point. The golgari only allowed us to come so they could spit in our faces.</p>, <p>I mean, rude, but not all that surprising.</p>, <p>[We can just leave?] I suggest. [Is there really a need for us to subject ourselves to this treatment? I’ve no doubt it’s only going to get worse.]</p>, <p>She considers it, seriously considers it, which is astounding to me. I’ve come to understand that a brathian passing up the chance to wheel and deal is like an ant refusing to tickle a grub. Absurd! Unthinkable!</p>, <p>[We will proceed with the mission,] she says finally. [We may be able to salvage something from this, no matter how those rock-heads treat us. If not, we will have tried. They are bound by many treaties when it comes to trade and interacting with my people, I’m confident we will be safe. However, just in case, Marzban, I want you and your people to take every precaution. I know this will be difficult for you. I apologise.]</p>, <p>The scarred warrior offers a crisp salute.</p>, <p>[Not to worry, Eran. My people will make sure we stay safe.]</p>, <p>I’m not exactly worried about the brathians, I’m confident <em>they</em> are going to be safe, it’s my siblings that I’m worried about.</p>, <p>[Do we know what arrangements they are allowing for me and mine? How many are allowed into the mountain?]</p>, <p>At my question, Eran loses some of her fire and looks distinctly uncomfortable.</p>, <p>[They only want a hundred inside.]</p>, <p>[A hundred.]</p>, <p>[Yes.]</p>, <p>….</p>, <p>When was the last time a hundred ants were on their own anywhere? This is intolerable! And who’s going to be in more danger, the hundred in the mountain, or the nine thousand, nine hundred who are stuck in the boats?!</p>, <p>Ugh. This sucks.</p>, <p>[I’m going to need to talk to Sloan about this,] I say, firmly.</p>, <p>[Anthony… we will make sure—]</p>, <p>[I’ll be talking to Sloan about what we decide to do,] I cut her off, not trying to be rude. [I’m sorry, but this is a family decision. We’ll let you know what we decide.]</p>, <p>Moored in the shadow of the sheer enormity of Greystone, I wait a little while as Sloan is brought over to my tub. For good measure, Cobalt comes with her, and I can tell that the carver is enamoured with the unnatural mountain.</p>, <p>“No, we are not building an absurd pillar to heaven,” I tell Cobalt immediately.</p>, <p>“Eldest, where on Pangera is heaven? The third? And no, we would never do this, but it <em>is</em> impressive, you have to admit.”</p>, <p>I sure do.</p>, <p>“Look, they’re only going to allow a hundred ants into the mountain, everyone else is stuck on boats. I don’t trust the golgari as far as I can throw them… wait, I can throw them really far…. I don’t trust the golgari, they’re going to try something. If we decide to go ahead with this, then I’m going to stay on the boat.”</p>, <p>I figure I’ll be able to protect over nine thousand ants out here, but only a hundred in there. It’s not a difficult calculation.</p>, <p>This sends Sloan and Cobalt into a period of deep thought, their antennae waving as they consider their options.</p>, <p>“What do the brathians want to do?” Cobalt asks.</p>, <p>“What do you think? They want to trade.”</p>, <p>More thinking.</p>, <p>“We will have to go through with it, but I am similarly concerned about security,” Sloan declares. “We can’t let our trading partner down, and they know more about this sort of thing than we do. However, I suggest that the hundred who go inside consist of mostly soldiers, and the cavalry. That way, their human partners can go inside with them.”</p>, <p>Makes sense, I suppose. We get more people inside while still only sending a hundred ants.</p>, <p>“Will it be an issue if we don’t send that many carvers inside?” I ask Cobalt.</p>, <p>“It would be if we were trying to conduct normal business,” she replies, “but we are only making a show of it, I suspect, then turning around and getting out safely. I agree with Sloan, this is the better option.”</p>, <p>“Guess that means I’m stuck on the boat. Dammit. Good luck to you, then. Hopefully, it all works out.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“You want me to go inside the mountain?” Isaac asked, surprised.</p>, <p>He turned and gazed out over the open waters toward the Legion fleet. It didn’t look like they were moving at all. Perhaps they had no plans to head ashore at this stop?</p>, <p>He turned back to the Eran.</p>, <p>“I’m good,” he said, smiling broadly and knuckling his moustache. “I like it out here on the water.”</p>, <p>But what if the Legion decided to dock later? It could happen.</p>, <p>“Check in with me again later, though,” he suggested, his eyes sliding back to the other fleet. “The situation might change.”</p>, <p>Eran Thouris, leader of the trade mission and head negotiator of the Brathian Island Conglomerate, fixed him with a hard stare. This was the kind of look that Isaac had become accustomed to over the years. When you said ‘no’ to a person whom you were in no position to refuse, they tended to give you this kind of look.</p>, <p>“Anthony has ordered it,” she said with finality. “You and your fellow cavalry men and women are to accompany a small team of carvers within the mountain. You are to organise and lead them. Begin now. We disembark in ten minutes.”</p>, <p><em>Plops</em>.</p>, <p>Finally, he was close to Morrelia again, and she remained tantalisingly out of reach, just on the horizon, haunting his waking hours along with his sleeping ones. Sometimes he swore he saw her, standing proud on the deck of the lead Legion ship, like an all-conquering Queen of old.</p>, <p>Irritated, he stomped over to Anthony, still sprawled in the middle of the deck, idly waggling his antennae and generally being huge. Isaac still wasn’t sure exactly how he could speak using the ants’ pheromone language, he certainly hoped his Class change hadn’t blessed him with a new organ, but it worked somehow.</p>, <p>Talking to Cavalant had ensured he was proficient, as well. That ant was one hell of a critic.</p>, <p>“Did you really order me to go ashore?” he demanded of the giant monster.</p>, <p>Anthony didn’t turn around, because he couldn’t.</p>, <p>“Yes. It’s the best way to keep our people safe.”</p>, <p>Isaac slumped. If Anthony had decreed it, then it was going to happen. The ants did whatever he told them to do, usually, even though Isaac had no idea why.</p>, <p>“Why are you in charge, anyway? I don’t really understand how it works.”</p>, <p>“I’m the oldest.”</p>, <p>“So?”</p>, <p>He could almost feel the mental sigh rolling off the giant ant.</p>, <p>The narrative has been illicitly obtained; should you discover it on Amazon, report the violation.</p>, <p>“You aren’t an ant, so don’t worry about it, Isaac. Get your people together to get on shore. Help keep my siblings safe. Besides, the only reason you want to stay out here is because you think the Legion won’t go ashore. They will. In small numbers, but they will.”</p>, <p>“Why small numbers?”</p>, <p>“Because I’m out here. The only reason they came this far is to kill me, remember? The Legion didn’t sail a fleet all over the fourth for tea and biscuits.”</p>, <p>Isaac stroked his moustache and pondered for a moment.</p>, <p>“Do you think….?”</p>, <p>“I don’t know if Morrelia is going to go ashore or not! Holy moly, Isaac. I swear your brain has gone to mush. Get your act together, man.”</p>, <p>The demon floating overhead thrashed and spat, no doubt saying something to Anthony via mental communication.</p>, <p>“You’re <em>both</em> weird,” Anthony huffed. “Try and focus, Isaac. I want my family to come back safe. That includes you. Now get going.”</p>, <p>Left without a choice, Isaac grumbled before turning around and heading below deck to find the rest of his squad. Cavalant was the first to detect something was different.</p>, <p>“New orders?” she asked, rapidly cleaning her antennae. “I don’t know why they bothered to tell you, the Eldest should just tell me these things.”</p>, <p>“We’re heading into the mountain,” Isaac sighed. “I think there’s going to be nothing but a road full of plops ahead.”</p>, <p>“Pessimist,” his partner dismissed his concerns too quickly. “The Eldest is here, things are going to be fine.”</p>, <p>All of the ants talked about Anthony like that, but Isaac struggled to share their confidence at times. After all, when their minds connected, the giant monster who towered over him sounded so <em>young</em>.</p>, <p>It made sense, all the ants were young… but stil….</p>, <p>“Alright then,” Isaac announced aloud to the other riders. “We’ve got a mission straight from the big guy himself. The golgari aren’t letting many ants inside, so we are going in. Get your stuff together. We have five minutes.”</p>, <p>Just like that, Isaac found himself as part of the official delegation striding off the smaller landing ship, across the wooden boards extended from the shore, and into a stone tunnel shaped into the side of the mountain. Within, the delegation found a welcoming party of golgari waiting for their arrival.</p>, <p>There were only six of them, which was a surprise, each coated in brilliantly gleaming minerals that formed their second skin. And of course, they were huge, each towering over Isaac, easily eight feet tall if they were an inch.</p>, <p>“We are representatives of the trading circle,” the central figure bowed at the waist in welcome. “My name is Gemmas. I extend our warmest welcome to the representative of the Brathian Island Conglomerate.”</p>, <p>Not a word of greeting for the ants of the Colony. Isaac felt compelled to share a message using his magical pheromones.</p>, <p>“Cavalant? This is plops, right here.”</p>, <p>“Shut up.”</p>, <p>“I’m telling you, this is going to go bad.”</p>, <p>“Based on what evidence? Now be quiet and keep your eyes open.”</p>, <p>Eran was replying, her tone rather more curt than one would normally expect from such a seasoned negotiator.</p>, <p>“I thank you for your welcome, we have felt the <em>weight</em> of it already. As you see, we have brought only a hundred members of the Colony with us into Greystone. I hope that assuages any fears or terrors your people may have felt?”</p>, <p>If any of these insults were landing with Gemmas, it didn’t show on her rock-covered face.</p>, <p>“Please, this way,” she gestured for them to follow her further into the dark tunnel. “There are members of the Shapers circle, Warriors circle, and Noble circle waiting to greet you deeper within the mountain.”</p>, <p>Isaac’s hand tightened around the pole of his spear.</p>, <p>He <em>really</em> didn’t like this.</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>Golgari society has long been divided in a caste structure based on profession. The outer circle, or the fourth, consists of those regular craftsmen and women, the farmers, the miners, the smiths and tailors and traders. No matter how high a level they reach, or what impressive feats they achieve, it is impossible for them to climb higher than the circle in which they live.</em></p>, <p><em>A half-step above them is the Shaper circle, a name given to those with the ability to shape the mana of Pangera and bend it to their will. In many ways, their inclusion above the fourth circle is something of a begrudging nod of acceptance from the golgari caste system, which existed long before the Rending.</em></p>, <p><em>For this reason, the Warriors have always held a dominant position within golgari society. It was they who fought and defended the early territories of their people, before mana began to saturate the surface and the Shapers emerged to wield it.</em></p>, <p><em>Above them all stands the Noble circle. These are the ruling Class of the golgari, but make no mistake, there are no Shapers among them. Family members of the Noble families who choose to pursue the art of magic and join the Shapers are cut off from their families.</em></p>, <p><em>This social structure is as rigid and unyielding as the golgari themselves, and yet, their people continue to thrive. The Empire of Stone survived the Rending, rebuilding itself from the devastation left by Yarrum. To them, theirs is a successful model for society. Why would they change it?</em></p>, <p><em>- Excerpt from ‘People of Stone’ by Xinci</em></p>, <p>Isaac found it difficult to follow multiple conversations at the same time, which he felt was a natural thing to struggle with. This task only became exponentially harder when one of those conversations was out loud and one of them was conducted with pheromones. Isaac was uncomfortable with pheromonal conversation on several levels.</p>, <p>Where and how did he produce pheromones? How did he <em>receive</em> them? If his Class had grown small antennae on his body somewhere, he would have a serious complaint. The ants were evasive, at best, when he tried to get answers to questions like this, saying they couldn’t possibly know how Classes worked.</p>, <p>“Are you paying attention, Isaac?” Cavalant huffed at him.</p>, <p>“Of course I’m paying attention,” he snapped back, “but having you chirp at me all the time isn’t helping.”</p>, <p>“I’m ensuring you’re focused on the right things.”</p>, <p>“You are, in this moment, <em>distracting</em> me from the very things you want me to focus on!”</p>, <p>“That’s because you aren’t paying attention.”</p>, <p>“I <em>would be</em> paying attention if you stopped nattering at me!”</p>, <p>“You just admitted you aren’t paying attention,” the ant noted, smugly. “Which means I’m right to tell you to focus.”</p>, <p>Isaac felt a headache coming on. He pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed a long suffering sigh.</p>, <p>“Let’s just agree, the two of us, to not talk, and listen to the envoys speak to each other. Then we can review afterwards and decide if someone wasn’t paying enough attention.”</p>, <p>Stolen content warning: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.</p>, <p>“I can’t understand their words.”</p>, <p>“I <em>know</em> you are getting a live translation from a mind mage! Stop being difficult!”</p>, <p>Finally, <em>finally</em> his partner and mount fell silent, flicking her antennae in a ‘have it your way’ kind of gesture, allowing Isaac to pay attention to what was going on around him once more.</p>, <p>Only a hundred ants had entered the fortress, and fully half of them were members of his cavalry squad. That meant fifty burly, powerful soldiers, built for strength, endurance and speed, along with their human riders, each one a trained warrior on their own.</p>, <p>Against what the golgari had brought, it didn’t seem like much at all.</p>, <p>Where before they had been greeted by six of the massive rock-people, now there were easily three hundred. Actually, knowing the golgari, there were likely <em>exactly</em> three hundred.</p>, <p>Eran was in the middle of speaking to the warrior triad in charge of proceedings. Because <em>of course</em> the merchants couldn’t run it. They weren’t allowed to run <em>anything</em>.</p>, <p>“We are grateful for this forceful and imposing greeting,” Eran said, not flinching away from calling out their nonsense.</p>, <p>She reminded Isaac of his ma’am a bit. She didn’t tolerate nonsense either, even when she probably should.</p>, <p>The warrior, covered in what appeared to be a gleaming coat of almost liquid metal, smiled wide and spread his hands.</p>, <p>“We simply want to ensure the correct message is sent regarding your welcome here. It wouldn’t do to have the Brathian Island Conglomerate think they were unworthy of our attention.”</p>, <p>“We note, and will remember, your treatment of this delegation,” Eran replied smoothly and Isaac struggled not to smirk. She was about half the height of the man she was talking to, but she didn’t hesitate to lay down the threats.</p>, <p>“We wouldn’t want it any other way,” the warrior replied smoothly. “Please follow me and we will escort you to your quarters. I expect you are fatigued after your long journey.”</p>, <p>He and his triad members turned to leave, only for Eran to interrupt them before they could move more than half a step.</p>, <p>“Actually, we would like to make the presentation as soon as possible and be on our way.”</p>, <p>The massive warrior turned back, a quizzical expression on his face.</p>, <p>“What do you mean?” he asked.</p>, <p>“I mean, I want to complete our business here, now, and be on our way. I’m sure that won’t be an issue? To delay these simple matters of trade would waste much of your precious warriors’ time.”</p>, <p>The silver warrior stood tall, a hand grasping his chin as he considered the much smaller negotiator through narrowed eyes.</p>, <p>“It would be unseemly to treat our guests so rudely,” he hazarded.</p>, <p>Isaac was confused. Did the golgari <em>want</em> them to stick around, or leave as soon as possible? He would have bet one of Cavalant’s legs that the warrior was going to leap at the chance to be rid of them as soon as possible. They couldn’t be worried about offending the brathians <em>now</em>, it was already far too late for that!</p>, <p>What was going on?</p>, <p>If anything, that response only seemed to firm Eran’s resolve.</p>, <p>“We would take no offence. In fact, I believe you would be doing my people a great favour were we to complete our arrangements as soon as possible. Actually, I must insist.”</p>, <p>Anger flashed through the warrior’s eyes.</p>, <p>“The Warriors of the golgari are not to be ordered by the likes of you.”</p>, <p>Eran Thouris did not bat an eyelid.</p>, <p>“You are bound by the terms of our treaty to ensure the safe conduct of this trade delegation, and that its business is concluded fairly. We are going to unload and display our goods right here, right now. If you aren’t ready to view them in two hours, then you will be in breach of the agreement and there. Will. Be. Consequences.”</p>, <p>Strangely enough, the warrior seemed to relax. He glanced down at his triad mate to his left, who nodded, subtly.</p>, <p>“That is acceptable,” he said. “We will have our people meet you here when the time is right. In the meantime, I will leave our warriors here to ensure your safety.”</p>, <p>“I bet,” Eran said, her voice dripping with sarcasm before she turned back to the gathered brathian and ants.</p>, <p>“Let’s get everything ready,” she declared. “Move it!”</p>]\n"
