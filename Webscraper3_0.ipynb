            "[<p>Emotions.</p>, <p>A strong feeling (reaction) deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationship with others.</p>, <p>I never fully understood them.</p>, <p>They weren't foreign to me—Anger, Sadness, Fear, GuiltI've experienced them all. Plenty of times before.</p>, <p>As humans, we were inherently designed to feel them.</p>, <p>...But merely experiencing them didn't equate to understanding them.</p>, <p>[Don't worry. I'll make sure to make it quick.]</p>, <p>A certain voice hung in the air. It was gentle, yet carried a gravity that drew my attention.</p>, <p>Two lackluster gray eyes seemed fixed on me.</p>, <p>Or… felt like it. I knew that it wasn't possible since the one talking was inside the TV screen.</p>, <p>However, as I gazed into those eyes, I had a sudden thought—'Why does it feel like they're looking right at me?'</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>I shook my head.</p>, <p>Stupid.</p>, <p>[This is the last step, right?...The last step before my hell is finally over?]</p>, <p>He stood solitary, amidst the wreckage. The landscape lay strewn with debris and shattered structures. The world around him seemed to have halted, frozen in a moment in time.</p>, <p>In that instant, the dullness in his gaze faltered, and what appeared to replace it was something akin to... anguish.</p>, <p>Grief?</p>, <p>[...Hah]</p>, <p>The man clutched his shirt, slowly wrinkling it as his lips slowly curled into a hazy smile.</p>, <p>[I'll do it.]</p>, <p>His head lowered to meet another gaze.</p>, <p>[...]</p>, <p>With black hair, this person knelt on the ground with their back faced against the screen, gazing up at the gray-eyed man. No words escaped their lips; they simply stared.</p>, <p>Perhaps he wanted to say something, but couldn't. After all, a large gaping wound was present on his back.</p>, <p>[Ah, yes... I shouldn't drag this out.]</p>, <p>The gray-eyed man lifted his hand, unveiling the cold gleam of a sword. His lackluster gray eyes quivered ever so slightly as the blade descended down in one fluid motion.</p>, <p>SHIIING—!</p>, <p>[I've waited far too long for this.]</p>, <p>The screen turned black.</p>, <p>\"Umm… So what do you think?\"</p>, <p>I heard a familiar voice call out to me, and I lowered my gaze.</p>, <p>\"Not bad, I guess.\"</p>, <p>While I inherited more from our father, it was evident that he had drawn more from our mother. His auburn locks cascaded gracefully to his forehead, and his green eyes gazed back at me.</p>, <p>This kid, who was my only remaining family, was my brother; Noel Rowe.</p>, <p> \"Not bad? Just that…?\"</p>, <p>\"What do you want me to say?\"</p>, <p>I wasn't much of a gamer. In fact, I never had the time to play games. There were things I needed to prioritize in life; however, leisure was not one of them.</p>, <p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that I found the game uninteresting.</p>, <p>\"I mean… You can lie.\"</p>, <p>\"And why would I do that?\"</p>, <p>\"Because it's my favorite game.\"</p>, <p>\"Right…\"</p>, <p>What sort of reasoning was this?</p>, <p>I blinked slowly before reaching for my drink.</p>, <p>\"You know… I think it's best if you don't drink.\"</p>, <p>\"I don't care.\"</p>, <p>Taking hold of the glass cup, I felt its coarse texture beneath my fingers before slowly bringing it towards my lips.</p>, <p>As the glass drew nearer, my attention fixated on the brownish liquid it contained. It was whiskey, a choice that seemed fitting for the moment.</p>, <p>As I cast my gaze downward, my reflection stared back at me, giving me a glimpse of the person I had become.</p>, <p>Hollow eyes, a vanishing mane of hair, protruding cheekbones—my visage had become something I wasn't able to recognize.</p>, <p>Even my hand quivered as I clutched the cup.</p>, <p>'I've had better days…'</p>, <p>I smiled bitterly to myself.</p>, <p>Stage IV Lung Cancer.</p>, <p>Not a pretty disease.</p>, <p>I still remember to this day the numerous emotions I felt during the day I received the news. I was just 24 years old. How was it possible for me to get cancer? But there was no denying what was inside me.</p>, <p>So…</p>, <p>I just accepted it.</p>, <p>Acceptance didn't come quickly. At first, I fought. I changed my diet and underwent Chemotherapy. But my life became miserable from that point on.</p>, <p>All my savings started to drain, and each day seemed more hollow than the other.</p>, <p>That was when I accepted my situation and just stopped everything.</p>, <p>Okay, fine. I'm dying.</p>, <p>Still.</p>, <p>*Sip*</p>, <p>Why make what remained of my life a torture?</p>, <p>I might as well enjoy what remained of it. Even if it made my life shorter.</p>, <p>\"B..itter.\"</p>, <p>My chest burned and my hand trembled.</p>, <p>Despite that, I kept a firm grip on the glass and continued to sip on it. Every breath I took was laced with pain, yet the pain at the back of my throat held a strangely comforting allure.</p>, <p>So I focused my attention on it.</p>, <p>Relished it.</p>, <p>\"…Brother, are you really just going to drink like that?\"</p>, <p>Noel's worried voice reached my ears.</p>, <p>But despite his worry, I continued to drink.</p>, <p>\"Let me... be.\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and savored the pain at the back of my throat.</p>, <p>Only this way could I forget about the other pain that was constantly invading my body.</p>, <p>*Sip*</p>, <p>It hurt.</p>, <p>I felt so tired. I could barely move. And I felt so useless.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I felt comfortable.</p>, <p>Yes.</p>, <p>This is how it should be.</p>, <p>\"Cou…gh.\"</p>, <p>I was caught off-guard. I wasn't able to hold it. My chest pounded fiercely, and my hand visibly shook. It took every little bit of my willpower to not drop my glass.</p>, <p>\"Brother!\"</p>, <p>\"I'm… Cough! F-fine.\"</p>, <p>I opened my eyes to see Noel staring at me with a worried look.</p>, <p>My vision shook, and my hand almost gave out, but I held it in.</p>, <p>Staring back at him, I only felt guilt. He was only 16 years old. Our parents had died a long time ago, and I was his remaining family.</p>, <p>…I didn't want to leave him alone, but what choice did I have?</p>, <p>If I chose to stay longer, with what money was he going to survive?</p>, <p>In a way, stopping Chemotherapy wasn't just because I didn't want to prolong my suffering. It was also a way for me to leave him something before I left.</p>, <p>Rather than leaving him in debt and dying, I'd rather die and leave him with something to lean on.</p>, <p>It was my duty.</p>, <p>My duty as his brother.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>Tears streamed down his face as he gazed at me. The incessant buzzing in my head made it difficult to discern his words, but it appeared he was trying to call an ambulance.</p>, <p>I stopped him and shook my head before pointing toward the TV.</p>, <p>\"Tell me… Tell me about the game.\"</p>, <p>\"Game?\"</p>, <p>Seeing his reaction, I managed to force a smile.</p>, <p>\"Yea-h. Tell me why it's your favorite game?\"</p>, <p>He wouldn't stop talking about it.</p>, <p>\"That…\"</p>, <p>He looked unsure of what to say, but after glancing at me once more, he wiped his tears and started to recount everything.</p>, <p>\"The game is called Rise of the Three Calamities, and the main character is called Leon. He's an orphan and the story starts at Haven. An institute, or more like an Academy where cadets are trained for the future of the Nurs Ancifa Empire. One of the four great empires...\"</p>, <p>To be honest, I was only able to make out a couple of words. After a certain time, all I could see was his mouth moving, but I just nodded along.</p>, <p>For the sake of it. I had to pretend to be fine.</p>, <p>So just...</p>, <p>'Let me die faster.'</p>, <p>Time seemed to flow endlessly and before I knew it, Noel was standing by the door of the apartment.</p>, <p>\"Brother, I'm going to go grab some Lunch. I'll bring you your favorite.\"</p>, <p>That… I could hear.</p>, <p>And just as his hand grasped the door, his feet came to a sudden stop.</p>, <p>\"I'll see you soon… okay?\"</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>I answered back, albeit weakly.</p>, <p>\"Good.\"</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>The door closed and silence filtered across the room.</p>, <p>\"…\"</p>, <p>For some unknown reason, the silence brought a smile to my face.</p>, <p>My eyes slowly closed, and I relished in the silence.</p>, <p>\"Cough!...Cou..gh!\"</p>, <p>Yet that tranquility proved fleeting as I was seized by uncontrollable coughing. When I reopened my eyes and gazed down, I caught sight of my hands which were stained in blood.</p>, <p>My blood.</p>, <p>\"Sh...it.\"</p>, <p>A clink resonated in the air.</p>, <p>The cup in my grasp had finally tumbled to the ground, and the world began to whirl around me.</p>, <p>'Looks like I can't maintain the facade any longer.'</p>, <p>Whiskey spilled onto the floor, and my chest throbbed intensely with pain.</p>, <p>I had managed to hold back before, but such a thing was no longer possible as all energy drained from my body and I leaned back on my chair.</p>, <p>'It's good that he didn't see me in this state.'</p>, <p>Sometimes, one suffers in silence not out of embarrassment, but out of necessity.</p>, <p>How could I allow my brother to see this?</p>, <p>\"Ha.. Aha…\"</p>, <p>I felt my chest tremble as something pierced right at my heart. It wasn't the same pain that I was accustomed to, but a different pain.</p>, <p>Anger.</p>, <p>Regret.</p>, <p>Sorrow.</p>, <p>Sadness.</p>, <p>Emotions.</p>, <p>That's what the pain was.</p>, <p>I felt them vividly.</p>, <p>I could tell them apart.</p>, <p>I was familiar with each and every one of them.</p>, <p>But I didn't understand them.</p>, <p>…And with these last thoughts, my eyelids gradually closed.</p>, <p>\"Ah…\"</p>, <p>That's when I took my last breath.</p>, <p>Or so I thought.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>'Uh... I'm still alive?'</p>, <p>There was no way. But... I was starting to doubt it. That was despite feeling certain that I had drawn my last breath.</p>, <p>It was the only logical conclusion I could make as I found myself standing on the remains of a city.</p>, <p>My sinuses clogged up as a result of the smoke that lingered in the air, and I heard a low, steady ringing in my head at the same time. Sort of like the buzz of a mosquito, but a lot more annoying than that.</p>, <p>With all of that taken into account, I was certain that there was something wrong with the situation. I felt there, yet not at the same time.</p>, <p>If that made any sense?</p>, <p>Must be some sort of hallucination one experiences before death.</p>, <p>It had to be.</p>, <p>I was more convinced of this when I found myself standing amidst the ruins of a city unknown to me, confused by the peculiar architecture of the buildings. They appeared to belong to a distinct era, unlike anything familiar to my own.</p>, <p>How weird.</p>, <p>The entire situation was weird and I had trouble wrapping my head around it.</p>, <p>Despite my eagerness in wanting to find out more about what was happening to me and what the city around me was, I couldn't.</p>, <p>I was stuck where I was.</p>, <p>Or more like, I was trapped.</p>, <p>I could see, smell, hear, taste, and touch just fine. It was just that, I had no control over my body. I felt as though I were a marionette, manipulated by an external force.</p>, <p>Rumble! Rumble!</p>, <p>My focus was captured by a distant rumble, prompting my head to turn toward the source of the sound. A voice unknown to me emerged, flowing from my lips.</p>, <p>\"It's about time... I thought they'd be slower.\"</p>, <p>There was something about the voice. It sounded unnatural. Almost robotic in my ears, but I couldn't quite tell.</p>, <p>Just what is happening?</p>, <p>I was flustered, but what else could I do? There was no way out for me, and all I could do was just observe.</p>, <p>BOOOM—!</p>, <p>A distant building disintegrated, and from within its ruins emerged a particular figure.</p>, <p>Our eyes met, and I instantly sensed an overwhelming weight pressing down on my body, stifling me.</p>, <p>\"I... finally found you!\"</p>, <p>A screeching voice reverberated through the air and the sky turned a scarlet color.</p>, <p>The pressure that bore down on me increased, and she soon appeared before my very eyes.</p>, <p>She was... breathtaking.</p>, <p>More so than anyone I'd ever seen in my life, making me further question the validity of what I was seeing.</p>, <p>Adorned with flowing, fiery red locks cascading down her back, her hair danced in the sunlight, displaying hues of crimson, copper, and gold, as if flames had been artfully woven into the fibers of her hair.</p>, <p>But it was her eyes that truly caught my attention. Gleaming like golden orbs, they possess a depth and brilliance that seemed to reflect the distant sun.</p>, <p>'Just what is happening?...and why is she looking at me like that?'</p>, <p>She seemed eerily familiar, yet at the same time wasn't. I more or less knew that I had seen her before, but I couldn't quite picture when.</p>, <p>\"Is that all you have to say to me?\"</p>, <p>Her gaze contained a little something. I couldn't quite understand what it was... perhaps longing? Disappointment? I wasn't too sure.</p>, <p> \"H—\"</p>, <p>My mouth had just parted open when all of a sudden, the sky which had previously dyed red, turned a purplish hue, and lightning began to crackle down from the sky.</p>, <p>Cracka! Cracka!</p>, <p>It tore at everything beneath, destroying the buildings and infrastructures with an unstoppable might.</p>, <p>In a matter of moments, the clouds ruptured, unveiling the silhouette of a woman. Her vibrant purple hair swayed gracefully through the expanse of the sky, while her piercing gaze, brimming with an overwhelming sense of animosity, fixated upon me.</p>, <p>Cracka! Cracka!</p>, <p>The sky continued to be ravaged by relentless lightning, intensifying the pressure that oppressed every inch of my being. The force was so formidable that my legs nearly buckled beneath me.</p>, <p>Yet, inexplicably, the individual I was presently \"possessing\" displayed unwavering stubbornness. My bones cracked, and I was having a hard time breathing under the extreme pressure.</p>, <p>Yet.</p>, <p>As if what I was experiencing meant nothing.</p>, <p>I remained standing where I was.</p>, <p>\"So... you're finally here too.\"</p>, <p>His voice carried through the air, reaching the woman with lustrous, purple hair suspended in mid-air.</p>, <p>The lightning surrounding her crackled with increased intensity, while her gaze seethed with amplified hatred. However, she remained immobile, as if she couldn't move at all.</p>, <p>That was when I felt my lips curl, and the world underwent another change.</p>, <p>From Red to Purple... to Black.</p>, <p>Abruptly, darkness engulfed my sight, causing the distant city to vanish entirely. The sky dissipated, and everything in my surroundings vanished, leaving only the two women ahead of me.</p>, <p>Emerging from the depths of the inky abyss, a figure took shape in the distance. Her eyes, a vivid shade of crimson, radiated with an intense luminosity that pierced through the darkness, unveiling a cascade of snowy white hair flowing down her shoulders.</p>, <p>She too...</p>, <p>Looked at me with nothing but hatred.</p>, <p>Ah... I get it now.</p>, <p>Her appearance was what it took to make me understand.</p>, <p>Understand why they felt so familiar to me before.</p>, <p>'They're the same girls from the game that my brother showed me before.'</p>, <p>Just before my death. There was one game my brother continued to talk about. 'Rise of the Three Calamities.'</p>, <p>I didn't know much about the game as I never got the chance to play it, but it was something my brother was enthusiastic about.</p>, <p>He wouldn't stop talking about it…</p>, <p>The pieces of the puzzle fell into place as soon as all three appeared before me, triggering a recollection of the game's cover. Although I had only glimpsed it briefly without giving it much thought, it took me a moment to jog my memory.</p>, <p>But now, I was certain.</p>, <p>The three women who stood in front of me... glaring at me with such hatred that made my heart palpitate, were the same Three Calamities that belonged to the game my brother showed me just before my death.</p>, <p>Or what I thought was my death. Was I still dead? I wasn't too sure anymore.</p>, <p>They were most likely the older version of the girls on the background of the cover.</p>, <p>Contrary to their youthful portrayal on the cover, the women before me appeared considerably older.</p>, <p>Their gazes deviated greatly from the playful depiction on the cover, radiating an unrelenting aura of bloodlust that seemed to want to eat me alive.</p>, <p>\"How long has it been since we've last been together?\"</p>, <p>My mouth parted. This time, I could hear the voice more clearly. It sounded oddly calm despite the situation he was in.</p>, <p>None of the girls spoke. They just stared at me with the same expressions on their faces.</p>, <p>My lips curled further.</p>, <p>\"I like those expressions.\"</p>, <p>My hand reached forward all of a sudden and a black chalice materialized, seemingly out of thin air, landing securely in my grasp. Enclosed within its confines, a peculiar black liquid resided.</p>, <p>Rumble—! Rumble—!</p>, <p>The appearance of the chalice seemed to have triggered something as the world suddenly started to quake fiercely.</p>, <p>The girls' expressions changed dramatically and the pressure that bore on me intensified.</p>, <p>Yet, despite it all. 'I' remained where I was.</p>, <p>\"S-stop!\"</p>, <p>\"Fuck, stop this bastard!\"</p>, <p>Strings of curses flew my way, but the only response was a slight raise of the cup.</p>, <p>\"Nooo!\"</p>, <p>As the chalice approached my lips, a fleeting moment allowed me to steal a glance at my own visage, mirrored within the depths of the dark liquid residing inside.</p>, <p>Handsome.</p>, <p>Was all I could think of as I stared at the man reflected within the liquid of the chalice.</p>, <p>'Is this me?'</p>, <p>There was an air of confidence and allure that emanated from him that perfectly matched the disposition he displayed.</p>, <p>His intense, hazel eyes held a mesmerizing depth, shimmering under the blackness of the liquid, matching his lustrous black hair. The strong, chiseled features of his face were accentuated by a well-defined jawline and a perfectly proportioned nose.</p>, <p>Never in my life had I ever seen anyone this handsome.</p>, <p>'Ha, I really must be dead...'</p>, <p>Rumble—! Rumble—!</p>, <p>The world around me seemed to completely crumble. Before I knew it, the three girls were already upon me. Coming from all sides.</p>, <p>Their power sent shivers down my spine.</p>, <p>But despite it all. 'I' remained where I was, feeling a slight curl at the end of my lips as the chalice drew to my mouth and I took a sip.</p>, <p>'It's bitter.'</p>, <p>Pfttt—!</p>, <p>At that very moment, as the initial sip of liquid touched my lips, a searing agony tore through me.</p>, <p>I felt something drip from the side of my mouth as my head slowly lowered. It was there that I caught a glimpse of a large sword.</p>, <p>It passed right through my chest.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>Red stained the top of the sword as it dripped from the corner of my mouth.</p>, <p>Slowly, my head turned, and it was there that I caught a glimpse of two dull grey eyes staring back at me.</p>, <p>\"Right. I forgot about you.\"</p>, <p>The words came flawlessly out of my mouth. As if nothing had happened. But I knew. I knew better than anyone that he was merely on his last straw.</p>, <p>Yet.</p>, <p>I remained standing. Proudly. In front of everyone.</p>, <p>Gulp—!</p>, <p>And with a gulp, the world around me turned dark.</p>, <p>The next moment I woke up, I found a large screen floating before my very eyes.</p>, <p>— ●[Julien D.

Evenus]● —</p>, <p>Something floated in front of me. I only caught a small glimpse of it. By the time I blinked, it was gone.</p>, <p>\"Ukh.\"</p>, <p>My head continued to throb.</p>, <p>How am I still alive...?</p>, <p> It didn't make sense.</p>, <p>The last memories I could recall were the last moments before my passing.</p>, <p>The exchange with my brother, the lingering scent in the room, and the bittersweet, yet smoky taste of the whisky coming down my throat.</p>, <p>\"How is this possible...?\"</p>, <p>As my vision cleared up, I tried to make out my surroundings.</p>, <p>It was an unfamiliar setting.</p>, <p>Nothing like I'd ever seen before.</p>, <p>My initial focus was drawn to the large desk right before me. It loomed large, dominating the space with its gleaming, well-polished wooden top.</p>, <p>Strangely, there appeared to be nothing resting atop the desk except for a vintage, antique night lamp, which emitted a soft, subdued glow, casting an eerie light across the room.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>A sudden noise jolted me from behind, and my body tensed. The back of my hair stood on end, and I flicked my head to look behind me.</p>, <p>Expecting the worst, my legs tensed as I readied to move out of my spot, but...</p>, <p>\"…No one?\"</p>, <p>I frowned.</p>, <p>There was nothing behind me except for a tall wooden bookshelf, adorned with a diverse array of books in various sizes and colors. Beneath it was a small book that seemed to have fallen to the ground.</p>, <p>It must've been the source of the noise.</p>, <p>\"Looks like I—Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>A sudden pain jolted me out of my thoughts. It pounded fiercely at my chest, and whatever words I was about to utter stopped.</p>, <p>\"Akkh...!\"</p>, <p>The pain was intense.</p>, <p>More than anything I had ever felt before. Every part of me shook, and my muscles started to spasm.</p>, <p>\"Ha… Akh...! What the…!\"</p>, <p>It was at that moment that I at last laid eyes on the sword jutting out from within my chest.</p>, <p>My entire body tensed as I felt every inch of my mind freeze at the sight that bore before my very eyes.</p>, <p>\"H... how?!\"</p>, <p>As if the scene from before replayed in my mind a sword appeared. It slowly clawed its way up from my back and into my body.</p>, <p>Horrified, I could only watch as the sword drew deeper into my body and pierced right through my chest.</p>, <p>I wanted to scream. Cling to something. Run.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>My body was frozen. I could only watch as the sword pierced through me, and pain invaded every inch of my body.</p>, <p>Blood trickled down my pristine white shirt, delicately drawing webs on my forearm before staining the wooden floor beneath, forming a muted puddle that gradually spread.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>Like the repetitive tick of a clock, the blood persistently trickled down to the ground.</p>, <p>The sight turned my stomach, and I could feel the color draining from my face.</p>, <p>It was the first time I had ever witnessed something so gruesome.</p>, <p>\"Haa… aha…\"</p>, <p>My breath started to feel heavy and my vision started to blur once more.</p>, <p>But before I knew it, the pain stopped. I didn't know when. I had long last track of time.</p>, <p>I extended my hand towards my back, where I could feel the hilt of the sword.</p>, <p>My fingers brushed against the soft leather grip that encased it, and for a moment, I contemplated pulling the sword out. But then, slowly, I withdrew my hand.</p>, <p>Despite the pain and the situation, I remained rational.</p>, <p>Yanking the blade from my chest would probably kill me. I knew that much.</p>, <p>\"H-haa...\"</p>, <p>My chest trembled as I took another break. As if I had swallowed lava, my chest burned with each breath.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>And blood continued to drip down from my chest.</p>, <p>When I finally found my voice again, I managed a soft mumble,</p>, <p>\"Is... this what hell feels like?\"</p>, <p>I wanted to laugh then and there.</p>, <p>Because.</p>, <p>\"I-t feels like shit.\"</p>, <p>But pain. I was used to pain. Every part of me hurt, but... compared to what I had been through the past few years, it was manageable.</p>, <p>I could take this much.</p>, <p>Sizzle~!</p>, <p>I believed it was over, but suddenly, a faint sizzling sound caught my attention. At that moment, a searing pain shot through my right forearm.</p>, <p>The pain was just as unbearable as the pain from before. It was entirely focused on my forearm.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I kept my mouth shut and stared at my forearm.</p>, <p>Pain I could deal with.</p>, <p>It wasn't anything new.</p>, <p>What grabbed my attention was the faint glow that formed on my forearm. On the spot where the pain was radiating.</p>, <p>Gradually, my eyebrows furrowed, and the glow on my forearm subsided.</p>, <p>\"...A tatoo?\"</p>, <p>A four-leaved clover was deeply etched on my forearm.</p>, <p>It looked like a cheap tattoo. It was all in black, and besides the soft glow that was slowly subsiding, there seemed nothing special about it.</p>, <p>The more I stared at it the more I felt like there was nothing special to it.</p>, <p>Uh...?</p>, <p>That was until all four leaves lit up with a strange white glow.</p>, <p>Stunned, I felt my eyes widen, and just before I could do anything, the world around me froze. I lost control of myself. I could no longer move, and everything around me gradually lost its color.</p>, <p>From the pool of blood beneath me, as though time were unwinding itself, the blood began to defy gravity, trickling upward and returning into my body.</p>, <p>\"...Uh.\"</p>, <p>Yet again, I was shocked. But I could do nothing.</p>, <p>I was stuck in place.</p>, <p>All I could do was watch as time seemed to reverse.</p>, <p>The elaborate blood patterns woven on my forearm began to shift and retract, seamlessly returning to my chest. Simultaneously, the sword that had penetrated my chest initiated a similar backward motion, gradually withdrawing from my chest.</p>, <p>I struggled to come to terms with what I was seeing and all sorts of thoughts flashed my mind, but...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>They all shattered when I heard the clanking sound of the sword behind me.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>The world regained its color, and I felt my breath again.</p>, <p>\"What...?\"</p>, <p>Everything around me was back to normal. From the book that fell from the bookshelf to the floor which was no longer stained in blood.</p>, <p>I remained seated where I was. Confused and dazed. It took me a moment to recover my bearings, and when I did, the first thing I did was stare at the sword that was lying on the floor.</p>, <p>There was something about it that felt unsettling to me.</p>, <p>It was as if there was a certain connection that linked between it and me. One that I couldn't explain.</p>, <p>Just as I was about to move to pick it up...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>The door to the room opened.</p>, <p>\"Young master.\"</p>, <p>A cold and even voice echoed within the confines of the room. It was a familiar voice. One which I vaguely remembered hearing before.</p>, <p>When I turned my head, my hair stood on end.</p>, <p>What...</p>, <p>Two dull gray eyes stared back at me.</p>, <p>For a moment, my thoughts stopped. Why is he here? Who is he...? And where am I?</p>, <p>The man from the vision.</p>, <p>The man from the game.</p>, <p>And the man who killed me in the vision.</p>, <p>\"They've called your name. It's your turn to take the test.\"</p>, <p>Why was he standing before me?</p>, <p>And why did it feel so real?</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I've finally lost it, haven't I?</p>, <p>I wanted to laugh but found myself unable to.</p>, <p>\"Young master?\"</p>, <p>As if my actions seemed weird, he tilted his head.</p>, <p>\"Are you okay...? Your face looks a little pale.\"</p>, <p>He took a step to approach me but I raised my hand to stop him. Recollections of the last memory kept replaying in my mind over and over again. As if it was a tape on repeat.</p>, <p>I had so many questions I wanted to ask him but kept my mouth shut.</p>, <p>My instincts, or more like, brain, was telling me that it wasn't a good idea.</p>, <p>\"Young master...?\"</p>, <p>And just as my name was called out again and he was about to approach me, I helped myself up from the chair.</p>, <p>\"Lead the way.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Lead the way... To where?</p>, <p>The echo of my footsteps rang in my ears as I followed the man from the vision from behind.</p>, <p>He seemed younger than the vision, and was it just me, or did he look pale?</p>, <p>Still.</p>, <p>Thinking back to my actions, I had acted purely out of instinct.</p>, <p>I knew nothing about the situation. Nor who the man in front of me was. No, not quite... I had an idea. One that I refused to believe.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>If there was something clear to me, it was that whoever the man in front of me was, he could kill me at a moment's notice.</p>, <p>One wrong move and I was dead.</p>, <p>\"Master has asked that you manage to pass the examination. In case of failure, he is prepared to exonerate you from the family.\"</p>, <p>His cold and even tone resounded across the empty corridor as he moved ahead of me.</p>, <p>I remained silent throughout the entire time.</p>, <p>\"It's important that you pass the examination. I can't stress that enough. For my sake as well.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Examination?</p>, <p>What examination?</p>, <p>I strained my ears and listened attentively. Every piece of information was vital for me.</p>, <p>\"That said, I don't believe a situation like that will happen. You're more than capable of passing the examination. At the very least, you shouldn't be worse than the commoners who only had one year of practice.\"</p>, <p>He continued to speak along the way. As I listened to his words, my eyes couldn't help but trace toward my surroundings.</p>, <p>What sort of place is this?</p>, <p>The corridor seemed vast. Large windows lit up the corridors with purple curtains draped around them. It gave off a medieval vibe.</p>, <p>But there was no way, right? How could it...</p>, <p>\"...We're here, young master.\"</p>, <p>I had no time to adjust myself to my surroundings before I found myself standing in front of a large wooden door.</p>, <p>My feet came to a halt and he pushed the door open to reveal a large hall where hundreds of people stood. They all lined up in an orderly manner, facing another door at the very end of the hall.</p>, <p>\"You are...?\"</p>, <p>A woman with short black hair and glasses approached me. She held a clipboard in her hand and scanned me up and down.</p>, <p>My heart grew tense at her appearance.</p>, <p>I thought back on her question, 'You are?' and found myself unable to answer.</p>, <p>I'd like to know that as well.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Even so, I kept my composure. We stood like that for a couple of seconds before her eyes fell on my chest where realization finally hit her.</p>, <p>\"Ah, you must be from the Evenus Barony.\"</p>, <p>She glanced at her clipboard.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus. I see you.\"</p>, <p> Julien Dacre Evenus?</p>, <p>Tapping the board, she smiled.</p>, <p>\"Please follow me. I'll lead you to the examiners.\"</p>, <p>I secretly sighed in relief before glancing back for a brief moment. My eyes met his for a moment and he nodded. I looked away and followed the lady.</p>, <p>She seemed to be leading me toward the large door in the distance. I could feel the gazes of those around me as I moved. However, I paid them no mind.</p>, <p>Not because I didn't want to, but because I couldn't spare them the thought.</p>, <p>The closer I was to the door the faster my heart started to beat.</p>, <p>The only thing I knew was that I had to take an examination. What sort of examination, I didn't know.</p>, <p>My palms felt sweaty and my legs felt like lead.</p>, <p>Each step felt heavier than the last.</p>, <p>The only reason I followed along was purely because the situation forced me to.</p>, <p>It felt like I had to move.</p>, <p>But what now?</p>, <p>What was I supposed to do now?</p>, <p>\"We're here. Please don't be too nervous. They won't bite.\"</p>, <p>The woman graciously opened the door, unveiling the expanse of a generously decorated room. Elegant paintings adorned the walls, flanking the space alongside pristine white pillars.</p>, <p>What grabbed my attention was the large wooden desk that sat in the middle of the room where four individuals sat. In front of them was a boy with blonde hair and blue eyes. He wore a strange uniform and stood upright in front of the four individuals.</p>, <p>I felt a terrifying pressure coming from the four of them, and amongst them, a woman with long flowing black hair grabbed my attention.</p>, <p>She seemed the center of the four people, not just because of her looks, but because of the aura she gave off.</p>, <p>She had something beyond her beauty... Something I couldn't quite explain.</p>, <p>Just what sort of...?</p>, <p>\"You must be Julien.\"</p>, <p>Her lips curled slightly as she glanced at the papers before her. Looking away, she pointed ahead.</p>, <p>\"You must be here for the examination. Please make your way toward the center.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I had no choice but to follow along.</p>, <p>It only became more evident to me that there was something wrong with the people in front of me when I closed in on them. I couldn't quite describe it... but just standing close to them felt extremely pressuring.</p>, <p>As if boulders were being pressed against my back.</p>, <p>Even so, I held onto my composure and kept my face firm.</p>, <p>But that only lasted a second before I felt my right forearm sting. What's going on? When I looked down, I realized that one of the four leaves from the tattoo had lit up.</p>, <p>Why was it...</p>, <p>As if bewitched, my body moved on its own and my finger hovered over it. I was surprised by the sudden development, but before I could snap out of it, my finger went down.</p>, <p>And.</p>, <p>I pressed it.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>\"...Huh?\"</p>, <p>The world turned pitch black.</p>, <p>All my senses seemed to disappear. Silence pervaded over the pitch-black space with nothing in sight. It felt as if I was levitating in an endless and lonely space.</p>, <p>It felt suffocating.</p>, <p>I was stuck in place, floating in this endless darkness that seemed to stretch endlessly. My consciousness was blurry, but I was aware of everything that was happening around me.</p>, <p>Was everything I previously saw another vision?</p>, <p>Is this what death feels like?</p>, <p>...It felt lonely.</p>, <p>And cold.</p>, <p>'Ah.'</p>, <p>The sensation didn't carry on for long. All of a sudden, a current ran through my body, jolting my consciousness awake.</p>, <p>When I came to, I realized I could finally move my body again.</p>, <p>Even so.</p>, <p>My surroundings were still dark.</p>, <p>'Hello?'</p>, <p>I tried to speak, but my mouth refused to open.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I held onto my composure and pushed away the anxiety and fear that was creeping up on my mind. I didn't let the darkness eat away at my sanity.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>'Hm?'</p>, <p>Just as I regained my composure, I spotted a bright light in the distance. A light...? It grew brighter by the second, its glow basking me in warmth.</p>, <p>It felt comfortable.</p>, <p>To the extent that I found my eyes slowly closing in relaxation.</p>, <p>'...Uh?'</p>, <p>When I opened them again, I was stunned by the sight before me and I held my breath.</p>, <p>'A wheel?'</p>, <p>Six colors, and six words.</p>, <p>Red - Anger</p>, <p>Purple - Fear</p>, <p>Blue - Sadness</p>, <p>Green - Surprise</p>, <p>Orange - Love</p>, <p>Yellow - Joy</p>, <p>A long red arrow pointed upward, currently resting on the color red.</p>, <p>Anger.</p>, <p>'What is this...?'</p>, <p>The six basic human emotions? I remember studying this back in psychology class, but why...</p>, <p>Trrrrr--!</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>The wheel began to spin on its own.</p>, <p>'...What's going on?!'</p>, <p>The colors alternated between red, purple, blue, green, orange, and yellow... They spun and spun and spun.</p>, <p>A deep sense of unease held me rooted. My eyes were fixed on the red arrow that remained firm.</p>, <p>The wheel continued to spin, and the colors continued to alternate. Gradually, the wheel lost its momentum before finally stopping.</p>, <p>'Purple.'</p>, <p>Fear.</p>, <p>Now what? My palms were sweaty, and the deep sense of unease that gripped my body seemed even more prominent.</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>And I was right to feel that way.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, the ground beneath me quaked. I almost lost my footing, and just as I regained it, I was shocked to see buildings sprouting from the ground beneath.</p>, <p>\"What...? Uh?!\"</p>, <p>I held my mouth.</p>, <p>\"I can speak again?\"</p>, <p>No, not just that... I looked around me. I was surrounded by buildings. No, not quite. They seemed to be ruins. The architecture reminded me of the one from the vision, but they were covered in vines and moss.</p>, <p>I couldn't quite get a good grasp of it since it was dark outside. However, from the corner of my eyes, I could make out faint figures in the distance.</p>, <p>Shadows?</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>A shiver ran through me as the cold wind caressed my skin. I grew tense, feeling a sensation that was akin to the gentle touch of two fingers slowly crawling their way up my arm.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa...\"</p>, <p>I felt my breath grow heavy, and as I tried to swallow, I found myself unable to. Something had gripped my throat. Something imaginary.</p>, <p>It prevented me from swallowing.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>My chest trembled.</p>, <p>'There's nothing in front of me...'</p>, <p>So why...?</p>, <p>Why did I feel so scared?</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I gripped my shirt, slowly wrinkling it in the process. There, I could feel the beat of my heart.</p>, <p>It was fast.</p>, <p>Ba... Thump! Ba... Thump!</p>, <p>And loud.</p>, <p>\"Ha...\"</p>, <p>My breath followed its rhythm.</p>, <p>It went faster.</p>, <p>And faster.</p>, <p>faster....</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa.. Ha...\"</p>, <p>I was hyperventilating.</p>, <p>My palms were sweaty and sweat trickled down the side of my face.</p>, <p>Fear had gripped me.</p>, <p>It was slowly consuming me.</p>, <p>I could feel it.</p>, <p>But why?</p>, <p>'...I need to run. Get away from here.'</p>, <p>My legs started to move. All thoughts disappeared and I just ran. Faster. And faster. And faster...</p>, <p>Soon, I found myself sprinting forward. I ran as if my life depended on it. I didn't know why I was acting like this, but if there was something I knew it was that I needed to run.</p>, <p>Get as far away as possible.</p>, <p>\"Ukh..!\"</p>, <p>I stumbled several times, scraping my knees in the process, but each time, I'd pick myself back up again and continue to run. I ignored the burning sensation that came with each breath that I took.</p>, <p>The only thought I had in my mind was that I needed to run.</p>, <p>I needed to get away from the shadows.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa.... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I'd look back from time to time, catching sight of them each time. The distance between us remained constant. Are they not running out of breath as well?...I can't keep this up for long.</p>, <p>The pain that gripped my lungs intensified. It was as if I was breathing fire.</p>, <p>But I had to hold on.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>Not...</p>, <p>Bang--!</p>, <p>My face came smashing against a hard surface.</p>, <p>\"Uakh...!\"</p>, <p>Ignoring the pain, I looked up.</p>, <p>\"No, I....\"</p>, <p>A shadow appeared. Its appearance remained a mystery to me. It wobbled in front of me, staring down at me as if I were some sort of prey.</p>, <p>\"Ah... Don't...\"</p>, <p>The sense of fear that gripped me intensified.</p>, <p>It was almost suffocating.</p>, <p>\"I... I...\"</p>, <p>The words refused to leave my mouth.</p>, <p>And then.</p>, <p>\"Uekh!\"</p>, <p>The shadow reached out for my throat, gripping it tightly. My eyes bulged, and I felt my body grow limp.</p>, <p>Ah, no... I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'll die...!</p>, <p>The feeling of helplessness under its grip, the steady thump of my heart, the weakness, and the gripping fear--all of it was etched deeply into my mind during those last moments.</p>, <p>What I was experiencing...</p>, <p>It was real.</p>, <p>And then.</p>, <p>Cr Crack--!</p>, <p>I felt my neck snap and the world turned dark again.</p>, <p>Only for a brightness to suddenly engulf me.</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Examinee?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...?\"</p>, <p>I slowly raised my head. Four figures sat not far from where I was standing. They all stared at me with frowns while a young man with blonde hair stood not far from me.</p>, <p>'Isn't this...?'</p>, <p>Slowly lowering my head, I stared at my right forearm where the tattoo was. It no longer hurt, and it wasn't glowing anymore.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>My arm was trembling.</p>, <p>The emotions I felt before... They continued to linger over me. I couldn't get rid of the sensation. It felt suffocating.</p>, <p>I needed an outlet.</p>, <p>An outlet to let everything out.</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Is everything alright? We don't have all day.\"</p>, <p>One of the people seated in front of me, a bulky man with a red beard raised his eyebrow, pointing at the young man in front of me.</p>, <p>\"...Show as what you've got.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>My feet moved on their own.</p>, <p>As if I had finally found what I needed, I moved toward the young man in front of me. He was staring back at me with a frown. As if he was trying to say, 'What is he doing?'</p>, <p>But I didn't care.</p>, <p>I paid him no mind and continued forward.</p>, <p>Before I knew it, I was standing before him. Just as his mouth opened to say something, my hands reached out for his head, grasping both sides solidly. My hands were still shaking but I kept a firm grip on his head.</p>, <p>His expression changed.</p>, <p>\"You, what are you...!\"</p>, <p>But I didn't care.</p>, <p>Feeling the sides of his face, my mouth parted open as I softly mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Fear.\"</p>, <p>My mind blanked from then on.</p>, <p>I lost myself in the moment.</p>, <p>When I came to, I was standing in the same spot I was before. My hands were no longer shaking, and my mind seemed calmer.</p>, <p>Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"H-help...! Haa.. Haa...!\"</p>, <p>When I looked down, I was stunned to see the young man from before on the ground. His face was pale, and he held his head with both hands while mumbling things like, 'Ah... I'm sorry...! Ah...'</p>, <p>As our eyes met, his expression distorted and his pupils dilated.</p>, <p>\"Ahhh...! N-no...!\"</p>, <p>He hastily moved back.</p>, <p>What is going on...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>A small screen appeared in front of me.</p>, <p>That was when I understood.</p>, <p>Lvl 1. [Fear] EXP + 10%</p>, <p>I did this.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Expectations were minimal before his entrance.</p>, <p>Behind their desk, the four examiners conversed with each other, reviewing the files of the examinees.</p>, <p>\"The overall talent level is lower than last year. It's rather disappointing if I'm being honest. At this rate, the other institutes within the empire will catch up to us.\"</p>, <p>The man with the red beard mumbled—Herman Chambers, a High-Wizard, and a man known for his discernible eye for talent. As such, he was put in a position of recruitment for the upcoming year at the Haven Institute.</p>, <p>Just by visualizing the flow of mana coming from an examinee's body, he could more or less tell if they were talented or not.</p>, <p>From the thickness, and its purity... He'd be able to discern the overall level of the examinee before they even performed.</p>, <p>\"Please bring the next examinee.\"</p>, <p>Compared to last year, the talents were severely lacking.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"We've found a couple of little monsters, haven't we?\"</p>, <p>There were a few exceptions.</p>, <p>And those few exceptions were far above the norm.</p>, <p>\"...I guess you're right.\"</p>, <p>Herman crossed his arms and leaned back on the chair. From the corner of his eyes, he glanced at the woman sitting beside him.</p>, <p>She adorned herself in formal attire, exuding a near-perfect aura. Her captivating presence left a profound impact on those around her. The flawless combination of appearance and clothing made her stand out from the rest.</p>, <p>Delilah V. Rosemberg.</p>, <p>There were no imperfections or voids in her, to the extent that she appeared to embody perfection itself.</p>, <p>Elegance seamlessly permeated her every action, word, and facial expression, defining her entire being.</p>, <p>She was an unreachable being to many.</p>, <p>Apprentice at 18.</p>, <p>Master-Mage at 19.</p>, <p>High-Wizard at 21.</p>, <p>Arch-Wizard at 24.</p>, <p>And one of the Empire's Seven Monarchs at 27.</p>, <p>Many foresaw her as the future of the Empire, destined to fill a position that had remained vacant for centuries—the most formidable mage among them all.</p>, <p>The Zenith.</p>, <p>'How can someone like her work here...?'</p>, <p>Such a question stumped many, Herman included, but whenever someone asked, all she'd return was an empty smile.</p>, <p>She wasn't a woman of many emotions, but when she did show emotions...</p>, <p>One'd feel chills.</p>, <p>\"...Our next examinee should be from a Barony.\"</p>, <p>Her crisp and clean tone rang in the room. It lacked substance and yet seemed to pressure at the same time.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus.\"</p>, <p>She mumbled a name, almost chewing on it as her eyes lingered over the document in front of her.</p>, <p>\"Talent. Elemental and... Emotive.\"</p>, <p> \"Emotive?\"</p>, <p>Herman raised his brow and picked up the document in front of him. 'Indeed, he has talent in the emotive field...' His expectations diminished.</p>, <p>It wasn't that he hated Emotive Mages, or looked down on them.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"It's tough.\"</p>, <p>Muttering with crossed arms and a dismissive shake of her head, Cathrine Riley Graham, a middle-aged woman with long flowing brown hair, expressed her thoughts.</p>, <p>\"An emotive Mage deals with the manipulation of emotion. It's not a rare talent, but...\"</p>, <p>Pursing her lips, she halted mid-sentence, allowing for another voice to complete the sentence for her.</p>, <p>\"...One might lose themselves if they immerse themselves too much into the study of emotions.\"</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>The Emotive field was a dangerous field. To study emotions... Understand them. One had to immerse themselves in them.</p>, <p>Immerse yourself too much... and you might end up losing sight of yourself.</p>, <p>\"I've seen my fair share of talented ones lose their minds trying to further their path. It's unfortunate. Really unfortunate...\"</p>, <p>\"Well, at least he's talented in the Elemental field. Curse Magic? Not a bad field.\"</p>, <p>There were no bad elements.</p>, <p>Only bad people.</p>, <p>Closely examining the paper in front of him, the door to the room opened. A young man in his late teens entered.</p>, <p>\"You must be Julien.\"</p>, <p>Delilah spoke, her crisp and clean voice ringing throughout the room.</p>, <p>His appearance grabbed the attention of all present.</p>, <p>'He's handsome, but... disappointing.\"</p>, <p>Herman's first impression of Julien was one of disappointment.</p>, <p>'His mana flow is irregular. The density is light and he doesn't seem to have control over it.'</p>, <p>Was he really a noble? As if he wasn't the only one who thought this, Catherine mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Seems like this one is a bit of a bust. Disappointing considering that he's a noble.\"</p>, <p>Herbert Newberman, sitting on Herman's right, shared similar thoughts with her.</p>, <p>\"His mana flow is all over the place. At first glance, he doesn't seem to know how to properly utilize mana. What a rough batch...\"</p>, <p>In the mind of the examiners, Julien seemed to have come in vain. His performance was going to be one that they'd need to erase from their minds.</p>, <p>But if there was one thing to take note of, it was his demeanor.</p>, <p>The way he carried himself... His expressionless face, and calm even steps...</p>, <p>It seemed to exude boundless confidence.</p>, <p>An overconfident idiot?</p>, <p>'Well, whatever. Let's get this over with. I've seen worse.'</p>, <p>Herman nudged the young man that stood in front of them.</p>, <p>\"Jason, go test him.\"</p>, <p>He was a first-year, or more like second-year now... cadet. He wasn't exactly the most talented cadet, but to test new examinees he was good enough.</p>, <p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p>, <p>Jason began to move, but just as he had taken a step forward, his face changed.</p>, <p>So did that of all the examiners.</p>, <p>\"What is he doing?\"</p>, <p>\"...Is he checking his pulse?\"</p>, <p>\"What sort of nonsense is this?\"</p>, <p>With a blank expression and finger pressed against his forearm, Julien stared ahead. He seemed out of it.</p>, <p>His face was blank.</p>, <p>Like that of an empty sheet of paper.</p>, <p>\"What is this guy doing...?\"</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Examinee?\"</p>, <p>Herman called out for him several times until he snapped out of it.</p>, <p>\"Ah...?\"</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Is everything alright? We don't have all day.\"</p>, <p>He irritably pointed at Jason.</p>, <p>\"...Show as what you've got.\"</p>, <p>Just as Herman pointed at Jason, a sudden change occurred with Julien. His pupils dilated. His face paled, and his arms began to tremble.</p>, <p>His sudden change took everyone aback.</p>, <p>Julien's eyes trembled, darting around hastily with an air of desperation. He seemed to transform all of a sudden, a complete difference from how he previously was.</p>, <p>His shoulders shrunk and his breathing quickened.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Everyone could feel the rhythm of his breath.</p>, <p>It was getting faster with each breath.</p>, <p>He seemed to be the embodiment of a certain emotion.</p>, <p>What emotion...?</p>, <p>Ah.</p>, <p>It soon became clear to everyone.</p>, <p>'Fear.'</p>, <p>He had started to embody fear.</p>, <p>Herman felt a chill run down his body.</p>, <p>Not just him, but the other examiners too.</p>, <p>\"You, what are you...!\"</p>, <p>Julien walked up to Jason. Perhaps taken aback by the situation, he wasn't able to react on time. Julien's hands came pressing against his skull, squeezing almost.</p>, <p>And,</p>, <p>\"Ahhhhhh...!!!!\"</p>, <p>A scream shook the room.</p>, <p>It pierced through it and reverberated loudly in the ears of everyone present.</p>, <p>Suddenly, everyone in the room was motionless, not just Herman, Herbert, and Catherine, but Delilah too.</p>, <p>The impact of Julien's action was just that powerful.</p>, <p>With one single action, he left everyone in the room frozen.</p>, <p>\"Ah...! No! Ahhhhh...! I don't want to die, no!!!\"</p>, <p>It was intense, and one could vividly feel the fear that Jason was feeling.</p>, <p>Goosebumps.</p>, <p>Herman felt goosebumps.</p>, <p>\"Ahhh...!\"</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>Jason fell liplessly to the floor.</p>, <p>Shaking uncontrollably, he clutched his head while writhing on the floor. Saliva spilled from his mouth.</p>, <p>\"H...Help...!\"</p>, <p>Despite his cries, none of the examiners moved.</p>, <p>All eyes were fixed on the young man that stood before them.</p>, <p>What was in front of them was the embodiment of someone who threaded a path hardly anyone took.</p>, <p>Recalling, Herman mumbled out loud,</p>, <p>\"For one to understand an emotion one must experience it.\"</p>, <p>To display such fear, one must experience it. Everyone in the room was well-versed and knew this much.</p>, <p>They had traveled all over the continent and met many Emotive Mages. From there, they learned of the harshness that one who threads such a path must endure.</p>, <p>To experience fear, one must relentlessly chase after it.</p>, <p>Many failed in their paths, dying in the middle of training, or simply not being able to understand the emotion.</p>, <p>And yet,</p>, <p>\"What sort of gruesome training did he undergo to display such emotion?\"</p>, <p>Julien was able to do what many couldn't. He was far from perfection, but to be able to do this at such an age...</p>, <p>'Just how harsh has he been on himself?'</p>, <p>Herman's evaluation of Julien underwent a drastic change.</p>, <p>'Not only is he able to perfectly portray fear, but he also seems to have mastered the state of immersion.'</p>, <p>A state many Emotive Mages chased after. A state where one could separate reality and immersion.</p>, <p>Was that why he checked his pulse beforehand?</p>, <p>To check his condition before immersion?</p>, <p>'A monster.'</p>, <p>He was a total monster.</p>, <p>\"If I may ask...\"</p>, <p>Catherine was the first to truly break the silence that took hold of the room, briefly glancing at the trembling Jason on the ground before settling her gaze over to Julien.</p>, <p>\"What sort of training did you do to be able to do this? And is it only limited to fear?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Her question was met with silence as Julien stood still.</p>, <p>He then lowered his head and shook his head.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>'Was it so bad that he doesn't want to talk about it?'</p>, <p>The judges felt their expressions harden.</p>, <p>And finally, Delilah, who had been quiet the entire time, with her gaze seemingly never detaching from Juline, opened her mouth to speak,</p>, <p>\"You're dismissed. We'll let you know your results after we've evaluated all the examinees.\"</p>, <p>Julien nodded his head and calmly walked out of the room. It was as if he hadn't done anything worth praising over.</p>, <p>When he left, Herman and the others looked at her.</p>, <p>\"Why did you let him go like that? We were still busy ex—\"</p>, <p>\"Take a look at the floor.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>And that was when everyone finally realized.</p>, <p>\"Ah...! Pl-please help me... Ah...\"</p>, <p>\"He's in no state to continue with the examination. Tell someone to replace him and send him to the infirmary. For now, we'll take a break.\"</p>, <p>\"But...!\"</p>, <p>\"I know what you want to say.\"</p>, <p>Delilah raised her hand to stop the other examiners from speaking.</p>, <p>\"You want to know more about him, right?\"</p>, <p>When Herman and the others nodded, Delilah turned to look at the door where Julien had left.</p>, <p>Her gaze told a thousand words.</p>, <p>Herman could tell.</p>, <p>Like the rest of them, her interest had been piqued.</p>, <p>Without a doubt, she wanted to know what everyone in the room wanted to know.</p>, <p>A question none of them dared to ask.</p>, <p>To what extent had he immersed himself?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Everything was a blur to me.</p>, <p>From the moment I poured out everything to what unfolded next, my mind felt shrouded in a perpetual fog.</p>, <p>I couldn't think straight.</p>, <p>\"What sort of training did you do to be able to do this? And is it only limited to fear?\"</p>, <p>My sole focus was getting out of here.</p>, <p>I could feel it from deep within me. I still hadn't let it all out. It was lingering within my mind, slowly creeping its way up.</p>, <p>'I need to leave...'</p>, <p>So, then,</p>, <p>\"You're dismissed. We'll let you know your results after we've evaluated all the examinees.\"</p>, <p>When the chance presented itself, I spared no time and left. Coming out, I felt the stares of everyone in the hall fall on me, but yet again, I could pay them no mind.</p>, <p>'I need to find somewhere safe... A bathroom, or room. I can't...!'</p>, <p>My steps faltered momentarily. I felt something rising from my stomach. Swallowing back, I forced myself forward.</p>, <p>\"Move.\"</p>, <p>I pushed everyone in front of me away and continued forward.</p>, <p>\"Hey...!\"</p>, <p>I didn't care about their protests.</p>, <p>A bathroom... A room... Something...</p>, <p>I continued to walk. I didn't care to look where I was. I only stopped when I found a room. Glancing around, I entered.</p>, <p>It was a small room.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa...\"</p>, <p>And most importantly.</p>, <p>Empty.</p>, <p>\"Blergh...!\"</p>, <p>The contents I so desperately held back came out all at once. My vision fogged, and I hunched over.</p>, <p>My stomach clenched with pain as I could feel the sweat on my forehead.</p>, <p>\"Ha-h...\"</p>, <p>I clenched my shirt, feeling the beat of my heart in the process.</p>, <p>It was fast.</p>, <p>Really fast...</p>, <p>I took deep breaths to calm myself down.</p>, <p>To calm my beating heart, but...</p>, <p>It wouldn't stop.</p>, <p>\"Ah... Ah...!\"</p>, <p>The fear that had gripped me moments before had come back to haunt me again.</p>, <p>I couldn't stop shaking.</p>, <p>It was as if something had possessed me.</p>, <p>\"Akh...!\"</p>, <p>I could feel it.</p>, <p>Clearer than ever.</p>, <p>I...</p>, <p>Was being consumed.</p>]\n",

Slowly, I was regaining control over my body.</p>, <p>Enough to be able to stand up.</p>, <p>I wasn't sure how long had passed when I was finally able to be myself again.</p>, <p>But it didn't matter.</p>, <p>Right now, all I wanted to do was figure out my situation.</p>, <p>\"Where is this place...?\"</p>, <p>Walking around the room, I traced my finger over a wooden desk.</p>, <p>It felt real to the touch.</p>, <p>Although I already knew, I did it to make sure.</p>, <p>None of this felt real to me.</p>, <p>\"A medieval style setting, strange powers and visions, a grey-eyed man...\"</p>, <p>The pieces started to put themselves in my head and a conclusion drew up in my mind. One that I struggled to come to terms with.</p>, <p>I was in the game, wasn't I?</p>, <p>'Rise of the Three Calamities.'</p>, <p>There wasn't much that I knew about since I'd never played it before, but from what I was told by my brother, it was a very popular game.</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>For what reason was I here?</p>, <p>And.</p>, <p>I turned to face the nearest window. It was dark outside so it was hard to see outside, but my focus was elsewhere.</p>, <p>Toward my reflection.</p>, <p>With deep hazel eyes, black hair, and a chiseled jawline, he appeared to epitomize perfection solely through his looks. I raised my hands to touch my face.</p>, <p>\"This is me...?\"</p>, <p>I found it hard to believe, but as I pinched my cheek, the reality seemed undeniable.</p>, <p>\"Crazy... This is crazy.\"</p>, <p>Even though this seemed to be my reality, I still found it hard to believe.</p>, <p>Creaaaaak—</p>, <p>My head flicked.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>A familiar figure stood by the door. He stood motionless, staring at me with his cold grey eyes.</p>, <p>\"Not feeling so well?\"</p>, <p>His tone seemed calm but all I felt was chills.</p>, <p>Step—</p>, <p>The wooden floor creaked under his step.</p>, <p>A strange tension lingered over the room as he stepped forward.</p>, <p>His eyes briefly paused on the puke on the ground then settling back to me.</p>, <p>Step—</p>, <p>He took another step.</p>, <p>Inching closer to where I was.</p>, <p>His every movement and action felt suffocating. As if he was dragging me deeper and deeper into the water.</p>, <p>I thought about running but realized it was futile.</p>, <p>There was no running from this man.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>I didn't feel like running.</p>, <p>Step—</p>, <p>He stood in front of me.</p>, <p>His eyes were intense. Closely reminding me of the ones he had in the vision. When his sword pierced me.</p>, <p>What did he...?</p>, <p>SHIIIING—!</p>, <p>My neck felt cold.</p>, <p>It all happened so fast that I had no time to react.</p>, <p>His mouth parted slightly,</p>, <p>\"You, who are you?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>My neck stung as the blade sunk slightly into my skin.</p>, <p>A wet trail traced down my neck.</p>, <p>\"You're not him. Who are you?\"</p>, <p>He seemed sure of himself. As if he was certain that I wasn't the person whom this body belonged to.</p>, <p>And he was right.</p>, <p>I wasn't.</p>, <p>Strangely, staring at the sharp tip of the sword that was pointed at me, I didn't feel a thing.</p>, <p>Would you look at that?</p>, <p>After all that fear, when the time came for me to feel fear, I didn't feel it.</p>, <p>It seemed to pale in comparison with what I'd experienced back in the examination room.</p>, <p>I cocked my head slightly.</p>, <p>\"What makes you think that?\"</p>, <p>My voice came out much calmer than I thought it'd come out in such a situation.</p>, <p>His lips pulled upwards.</p>, <p>\"He wouldn't have reacted the way that you did had he been in a similar position.\"</p>, <p>Is that so?</p>, <p>\"How would he have reacted?\"</p>, <p>\"By cursing me.\"</p>, <p>I thought back to the vision.</p>, <p>He didn't strike me to be that type of guy.</p>, <p>I still tried.</p>, <p>\"Get your fucking hands off of me.\"</p>, <p>\"No, not quite. Still missing something.\"</p>, <p>\"As in?\"</p>, <p>\"Try, 'get your fucking hands off of me dirty bastard'. That's how he'd reply.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>Quite informative.</p>, <p>I gripped the blade that was attached to my neck and tried to pull it away. Through my gritted teeth, I spat,</p>, <p>\"Get your fucking hands off of me dirty bastard!\"</p>, <p>\"Better.\"</p>, <p>Unfortunately, the blade wouldn't budge.</p>, <p>Was the difference in our strength that vast?</p>, <p>\"Don't bother. I'm a knight. Our strength difference is not something that you can bridge with that body of yours.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>I let go and stared at my hand.</p>, <p>It was bleeding.</p>, <p>Still, it helped me calm down even more.</p>, <p>My heart was no longer beating as fast as it was before, and my mind felt a lot clearer.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>We stood face to face with each other, neither one of us speaking.</p>, <p>He was the first one to break the silence.</p>, <p>\"I heard an interesting rumor.\"</p>, <p>I stood still and listened to his words.</p>, <p>There was nothing I could do at the moment.</p>, <p>The powers I displayed before, I knew nothing about them nor how to use them.

He seemed to be in deep thought, and when he looked back at me, he asked,</p>, <p>\"What sort of answers are you looking for?\"</p>, <p>\"Who am I?\"</p>, <p>\"Hm...?\"</p>, <p>\"Where am I?

There was, however, a consensus amongst the staff.</p>, <p>And that was that commoners were not equal to nobles.</p>, <p>But it wasn't for silly reasons such as the purity of their bloodline or background. It had to do more with the Empire's law.</p>, <p>Commoners were only allowed to practice mana from the age of 17.</p>, <p>To maintain their authority within the empire, the royal family—The Megrail Family—strictly forbade the common people from practicing mana until they hit a certain age.</p>, <p>The same was true for nobles as well.</p>, <p>In contrast to the commoners, individuals of nobility were permitted to practice mana at a younger age. However, there existed an age restriction that varied based on their noble status.</p>, <p>Only the direct lineage of the Megrail Family was allowed to practice mana since birth.</p>, <p>It was therefore normal for those of the Megrail lineage to rank first whenever a descendant entered Haven.</p>, <p>And yet,</p>, <p>\"You're saying there's someone better fit for the top rank.

A little more...</p>, <p>I was close.</p>, <p>I could feel it.</p>, <p>I was...</p>, <p>Tzz</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>The circle shattered.</p>, <p>All the progress disappeared in an instant.</p>, <p>∎ [Hands of malady] EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>It wasn't an unexpected outcome. It had been like this for the entire week.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"...It's frustrating.\"</p>, <p>Trying over and over and over again, with little to no progression.</p>, <p>I thought that with enough time and practice, I'd see some improvement, but in the week that I started practicing, the only result I received was failure.</p>, <p>Drip...</p>, <p>Something wet trickled down from my nose.</p>, <p>I used my sleeve to wipe it. Only for it to be stained in red.</p>, <p>That was when I realized.</p>, <p>\"Blood...\"</p>, <p>\"You're overworking yourself.\"</p>, <p>Finally, I looked up. There, standing by the entrance of the door to my room was Leon. His grey eyes were as intense as ever.</p>, <p>\"You're trying to learn curse magic, right? So that you wouldn't look suspicious when the time comes.\"</p>, <p>\"...Right.\"</p>, <p>No, not really.</p>, <p>It was part of the reason. But it was mainly because learning any other magic would prove to be too hard of a task for me.</p>, <p>The current me that was.</p>, <p>\"Here you go.</p>, <p>Leon walked up to me to hand me a piece of paper.</p>, <p>\"This is the speech I prepared for you. You won't have to worry about practicing it because it's pretty straightforward. Plus... Nobody will suspect a thing if you say it exactly as it's written.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>I reached out to take it when he pulled back. I was taken aback.</p>, <p>\"...What are you doing?\"</p>, <p>\"On second thought, I'll give it to you later.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>He pointed at my nose.</p>, <p>\"Clean yourself up. You're in no state to think about the speech.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>I reached for the nearest tissue to clean up my nose. It was still leaking blood. As expected, I had been practicing a little too hard.</p>, <p>Leon stood quietly beside me.</p>, <p>Closely observing me.</p>, <p>That was until,</p>, <p>\"I'll take my leave. We'll meet before the speech.\"</p>, <p>He decided to leave.</p>, <p>\"Wait. The speech...!\"</p>, <p>He left before I had the chance to ask him for the paper.</p>, <p>\"...Shit.\"</p>, <p>I stuffed a tissue up my nose.</p>, <p>\"He's still wary of me.\"</p>, <p>In the week I spent with Leon, he always seemed on edge around me. I knew exactly why he was like that, and I took full advantage of it.</p>, <p>\"I don't have much time.\"</p>, <p>But I knew that I couldn't keep the facade for much longer.</p>, <p>It wouldn't take too long for him to understand that he could kill me with a thought. That was why I was so desperate for progression.</p>, <p>Only through power would I be able to keep myself alive.</p>, <p>\"...I should go.\"</p>, <p>I checked my watch.</p>, <p>It was almost time for me to give my speech. It wasn't as though I was nervous. I was far from it.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"What then...?\"</p>, <p>My goal was to find answers. And despite a week having passed, the only thing I managed to gain was even more questions.</p>, <p>This was indeed the world of 'Rise of the Three Calamities'.</p>, <p>Although I had never played the game, the situation became clear to me after experiencing the world for the past week.</p>, <p>In the week, I continuously thought about leaving this place.</p>, <p>The vision that preceded my arrival here depicted me getting killed by a long blade, with three women in pursuit.</p>, <p>Was the vision the Julien of the future, or was it me of the future...?</p>, <p>Even if it was, how long did I have before Leon killed me?</p>, <p>\"...Regardless of the outcome, it seems like every move I make leads to my death.\"</p>, <p>For such a future, wasn't the appropriate answer to just run away? Leave this place. Surely, I'd be able to live a good life if I did.</p>, <p>\"...As if.\"</p>, <p>The thought of not knowing why I was here seemed to eat at me more than my desire to live.</p>, <p>I guess, having already died once, I placed less importance on my life than the truth.</p>, <p>\"That's not all...\"</p>, <p>My eyes wandered back to my arm.</p>, <p>Turning it, a four-leaved clover entered my sight.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>One of the leaves lit up.</p>, <p>A feeling of dread welled up within the depths of my mind as my gaze remained fixed on the leaf. It was the same leaf from last time.</p>, <p>It reminded me of the time during the examination.</p>, <p>The leaf was the reason why I was able to become the Black Star.</p>, <p>I still didn't know what it did.</p>, <p>By the time I woke up the next day, it had lit up again. I hadn't touched it since. The lingering aftereffects of the situation were still affecting me. Was my mind even capable of withstanding such intense emotions again...?</p>, <p>I wasn't quite sure.</p>, <p>But if there was one thing that I knew...</p>, <p>\"Emotions.\"</p>, <p>Anger, sadness, joy, love, surprise, fear...</p>, <p>\"...I won't be consumed.\"</p>, <p>Rustle</p>, <p>I donned a black blazer and black leather gloves to hide the wounds on my hands.

            "[<p>Rustle!</p>, <p>A fluttering of the clothes.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>The small wisps of water vapor swirling in the air before vanishing.</p>, <p>And the cold chill that pressed against the cheeks early in the morning.</p>, <p>Indeed, this was real.</p>, <p>I was once again reminded of that.</p>, <p>\".....Took you long enough.\"</p>, <p>Waiting for me outside the residence was Leon. Clad in a matching blazer, a sword at his hip, he casually brushed his hair.</p>, <p>\"We'll be late if we don't hurry.\"</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>The two of us walked on the empty streets.</p>, <p>Tak</p>, <p>The gentle click of our heels echoed in the air.</p>, <p>He walked by my side, maintaining a respectable distance. That was his duty as Julien's designated knight.</p>, <p>The city we were in was called Lens.</p>, <p>It was the nearest city to Haven and our temporary residence. Currently, being early in the morning, there weren't many people outside.</p>, <p>The cobblestone streets were empty.</p>, <p>It was just the two of us.</p>, <p>\"We're here.\"</p>, <p>We didn't walk far. Our destination was merely a few minutes away from the residence, located near the city center. Unlike the streets, this place was packed with people.</p>, <p>Leon handed me a small paper.</p>, <p>\"Here's your ticket.\"</p>, <p>\"Thanks.\"</p>, <p>One that I took.</p>, <p>Rather than a knight, secretary seemed more fitting for him.</p>, <p>\"Wow.\"</p>, <p>I stopped in my tracks to stare ahead.</p>, <p>I was still having a hard time getting used to the sight before me.</p>, <p>A means of transportation unfitting for a world like this. One that seemed to function even better than the locomotives in the modern age.</p>, <p>\"...This really is a game.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm? Did you say something?\"</p>, <p>\"Nothing.\"</p>, <p>I boarded the train, making my way toward my cabin. [A-25] Ah... Right here. It was rather spacious and had a wide window for me to look at.</p>, <p>From there, I could see the scenery outside. The lush trees, the tall mountains in the distance, and the orange glow that dyed the sky.</p>, <p>...It felt peaceful.</p>, <p>\"How is it? Is it to your satisfaction young master?\"</p>, <p>Leon's voice brought me back. I turned to glance at him.</p>, <p>\"You can drop the act when it's just us.\"</p>, <p>The whole 'young master' thing felt rather uncomfortable. I wasn't Julien. He didn't have to call me that.</p>, <p>\"I'd rather not.\"</p>, <p>\"Suit yourself.\"</p>, <p>But he seemed insistent on calling me that.</p>, <p>I wasn't going to force him.</p>, <p>There were other things that I needed to pay more attention to.</p>, <p>Like,</p>, <p>How would Julien conduct himself if he were to give a speech?</p>, <p>The speech.</p>, <p>As Leon said. I needed to act closely as the previous Julien acted. In this world, possessing someone else's body wasn't merely a fantasy.</p>, <p>Many were capable of such a feat. Some for looks, and others for longevity reasons.</p>, <p>Unless I acted like Julien, then there was a chance someone might find out.</p>, <p>I couldn't allow that to happen.</p>, <p>\"Here's the speech.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, I wasn't completely unprepared. Having discussed it with Leon, he already had a speech prepared for me.</p>, <p>\".....Ah, thanks.\"</p>, <p>I opened the paper to see the speech. A quick scan and I didn't see anything wrong with it. In fact, it was quite short.</p>, <p>Is this good enough...?</p>, <p>\"I could've prepared the speech by myself.\"</p>, <p>Things would've probably been easier for me if that was the case.</p>, <p>\"Maybe.\"</p>, <p>Maybe...?</p>, <p>\"I just didn't want to take any risks.\"</p>, <p>\"Then couldn't I have just shown you my speech while you helped me correct along the way?\"</p>, <p>\"That would've taken longer.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I chose to leave the subject there. It didn't seem like my words were getting through to him.</p>, <p>He doesn't trust me at all.</p>, <p>Noted.</p>, <p>I shifted my attention back to the speech. It wasn't long and also wasn't hard to memorize. I could learn this.</p>, <p>While I immersed myself in the speech, the train started to move.</p>, <p>The pistons roared and the train picked up speed.</p>, <p>I naturally turned my head to look at the window.</p>, <p>Unknowingly, the paper in my hand wrinkled.</p>, <p>Rustle</p>, <p>Finally.</p>, <p>I was walking into the devil's den.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Haven, Leoni Hall.</p>, <p>His presence grabbed the eyes of all in attendance.</p>, <p>An exquisite appearance that stood out from the rest. Clad in clothing that highlighted his lean and muscular physique, his appearance imprinted itself in the minds of all present.</p>, <p>He strode with measured steps, reaching the center of the podium.</p>, <p>\"The Black Star.\"</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>\"...He's here.\"</p>, <p>A fact Aoife was made aware of the moment his name was called out.</p>, <p>Her gaze traced over his body. His every action, movement, expression... she marked them in her mind, making sure to miss nothing.</p>, <p>He was the one who took the title away from her. Someone her cousin and the institute's board seemed enamored with.</p>, <p>And the one that stood above her.</p>, <p>「It's a pleasure to be standing here amongst all of you.」</p>, <p>His tone felt rather flat.</p>, <p>It lacked any highs and lows, sounding rather indifferent.</p>, <p>「It is with great honor that I find myself in this position.」</p>, <p>As if he didn't mean the words that he was saying.</p>, <p>That was what Aoife thought at first. However, all of a sudden Julien's gaze shifted.</p>, <p>「Many of you stand at the very peak of the Empire. Proud sons of heaven...」</p>, <p>It turned sharp.</p>, <p>「Everywhere you go, people will praise you. Call you the elites of the Empire.」</p>, <p>Like that of a sharpened blade.</p>, <p>「Someone that should be worshiped.」</p>, <p>Stabbing right at those present in the hall.</p>, <p>「But...」</p>, <p>He suddenly paused, and just faintly, Aoife noticed a change. His lips... They were pulled into a smile.</p>, <p>「Remember.」</p>, <p>And as his gaze swept the hall,</p>, <p>He slowly muttered,</p>, <p>「I stand above you.」</p>, <p>The entire hall fell into a state of silence.</p>, <p>Aoife's expression underwent a small change.</p>, <p>\"What is he.....\"</p>, <p>She looked around her. All the cadets wore similar expressions. One of utter shock which soon morphed into anger.</p>, <p>The previously quiet hall started to heat up.</p>, <p>\"What did he just say...?\"</p>, <p>\"Who is this arrogant bastard?\"</p>, <p>\"Did he just say that?\"</p>, <p>Aoife took in the sight around her. The disorder and chaos that was slowly taking shape. The flustered and shocked looks of the professors. The angered looks of the cadets.</p>, <p>.....And the stoic, yet arrogant look of the Black Star who stood at the center of it all.</p>, <p>\"This isn't right.\"</p>, <p>The Black Star was supposed to be a leading figure.</p>, <p>Someone the other cadets looked up to.</p>, <p>And yet,</p>, <p>Aoife tore her gaze away from the chaos happening around her and closed her eyes.</p>, <p>\"As expected...\"</p>, <p>Her fists slowly started to clench.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus.\"</p>, <p>He wasn't fit to be the Black Star.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The weight of over a hundred eyes weighed heavily on me. My every action seemed to be closely scrutinized.</p>, <p>From the way I walked, the way I looked, and the way I spoke.</p>, <p>All of it was assessed.</p>, <p>But even so, I didn't feel nervous. I had been a salesman in my past life. Things like this weren't a problem for me.</p>, <p>I tapped on the small ball in front of me.</p>, <p>\"It's a pleasure to be standing here amongst all of you.\"</p>, <p>It appeared to be a microphone. My voice echoed throughout the hall, reaching the ears of all present.</p>, <p>The gazes were now truly on me.</p>, <p>\"Many of you stand at the very peak of the Empire. Proud sons of heaven...\"</p>, <p>I kept my tone flat.</p>, <p>\"Everywhere you go, people will praise you. Call you an elite of the Empire.\"</p>, <p>This was simply because Leon suggested me to. He was the one who came up with the speech after all.</p>, <p>\"Someone that should be worshiped.\"</p>, <p>But that wasn't the reason why I followed the speech.</p>, <p>\"But...\"</p>, <p>The main reason why I followed it was because,</p>, <p>\"Remember.\"</p>, <p>I liked it.</p>, <p>\"I stand above you.\"</p>, <p>I almost laughed after saying that line. Taking in the expressions of all those in the hall, I almost regretted not having a phone.</p>, <p>It wasn't a pretty sight.</p>, <p>Amidst the glares of disgust, hatred, and scorn directed towards me, I chose to stand my ground next to the podium, taking in everything that was directed my way.</p>, <p>Leon's reasoning behind the speech was that he believed this was what the previous Julien would've said.</p>, <p>I didn't doubt it.</p>, <p>But that wasn't the reason why I went through with it. If I wanted to, I could've said something different.</p>, <p>But I didn't.</p>, <p>\"What sort of joke is this?\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, one of the cadets stood up from their seat and shouted,</p>, <p>\"Are you seriously supposed to be the Black Star? I refuse to believe someone like you can be our top ranker! I request a duel!\"</p>, <p>Ah, yes.</p>, <p>This was what I wanted.</p>, <p>A cliche scenario.</p>, <p>\"Me too!\"</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus. I request a duel...!\"</p>, <p>What came after the first was the second, and then the third...</p>, <p>\"Fight me!\"</p>, <p>The entire hall became heated with several cadets standing up and challenging me on the spot.</p>, <p>While some appeared to be influenced by a few instigators, a significant number seemed genuinely eager to fight me.</p>, <p>'Yeah, this is it.'</p>, <p>It was the effect that I desired to achieve.</p>, <p>My time was limited.</p>, <p>I needed to get stronger. And for that, I needed a target on my back.</p>, <p>Pressure.</p>, <p>A comfortable environment wouldn't shape me into a stronger individual. What I craved was pressure, and the best way to intensify the pressure on myself was to provoke every first-year in attendance.</p>, <p>'It was bound to happen anyways...'</p>, <p>I wasn't naive enough to think nobody would challenge me the moment I entered the institute.</p>, <p>It was bound to happen.</p>, <p>I only hurried that process.</p>, <p>'Only this way can I force myself to improve faster...'</p>, <p>I could already feel the weight of my actions on my shoulders. It weighed heavily on them, but it was necessary.</p>, <p>Growth can only be achieved through struggle.</p>, <p>And what better way to make myself struggle than this?</p>, <p>'That's right.'</p>, <p>This had to be done.</p>, <p>For the sake of my growth.</p>, <p>\"I'll do anything.\"</p>]\n",

He walked toward me with an air of casualness.

Why does it seem like you're surprised?\"</p>, <p>\"I didn't think you'd go through with it.\"</p>, <p>\"...And why is that?\"</p>, <p>So he was expecting me to say something else...?</p>, <p>\"No...\"</p>, <p>He pursed his lips and shook his head.</p>, <p>\"It's nothing.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>What was up with this guy?</p>, <p>Closely looking at him, his expression seemed unusually stiff.

The trembling on my hand stopped, and my expression stiffened.</p>, <p>\"You've changed a lot.\"</p>, <p>A voice reached my ears.</p>, <p>She stopped a few meters ahead of me.</p>, <p>Her appearance was amongst some of the best I've ever seen. Long flowing purple hair and crystal blue eyes. An image overlapped with hers.</p>, <p>One that was filled with nothing but hatred toward myself.</p>, <p>\"...It's been a while.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn J. Verlice. This body's childhood friend, and someone who knew Julien extremely well.</p>, <p>I hadn't spent the past week doing anything outside of practicing magic.</p>, <p>To make sure everything flowed smoothly, I had Leon provide me with details on all important characters related to Julien and their relationship with him.</p>, <p>It was why I knew who she was.</p>, <p>\"I see that you've become the Black Star.\"</p>, <p>An empty compliment. Her tone was cold and lacked any form of praise. She was also not looking at me.</p>, <p>Her eyes... They seemed to be glued to my hand.</p>, <p>The one grasping Leon's shoulder.</p>, <p>She softly whispered,</p>, <p>\"Maybe you haven't changed, after all.\"</p>, <p>Her tone was laced with disappointment.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Only that I had no idea what she was talking about.</p>, <p>I only pretended to understand her, and her expression pained.</p>, <p>\"When will you stop...?\"</p>, <p>She couldn't meet my gaze at all.</p>, <p>The disappointment seemed to be too much for her to handle.</p>, <p>In a situation like this, the only way I could respond was,</p>, <p>\"Stop what?\"</p>, <p>\"...Yeah, right.\"</p>, <p>She smiled weakly.</p>, <p>It was as if she expected such an answer from me.</p>, <p>\"I waited for you. I really did. Even when you changed, I waited. I thought you'd come back to how you normally were, but....\"</p>, <p>Stopping herself, she shook her head.</p>, <p>Softly, she mumbled in a voice that I could barely hear, 'It's not worth it. There's no point.'</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I thought she'd give up from that point, but yet again, her eyes fell on my hand.</p>, <p>And then toward Leon.</p>, <p>\"Why do you let him treat you like this?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Leon stood quietly. He seemed to be chewing on his words, seemingly thinking about how to respond.</p>, <p>She spoke before he could,</p>, <p>\"I know you're loyal to the family, but why let yourself be treated like this? You're better than thi—\"</p>, <p>\"It's none of that.\"</p>, <p>Leon cut her off mid-sentence.</p>, <p>Her expression froze.</p>, <p>\"He wasn't doing anything to me.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>She stepped back and made an incredulous look. She seemed even more disappointed.</p>, <p>\"...Do you take me for some sort of fool? I saw all of it.\"</p>, <p>Saw all of it?</p>, <p>I couldn't help but speak out.</p>, <p>\"What did you see?\"</p>, <p>I struggled to understand what she was trying to say.</p>, <p>\"Seriously...?\"</p>, <p>Her expression seemed scornful.</p>, <p>\"It was obvious what you were trying to do. How many times do you think I've seen the same scene in the past? You were using him as your test dummy, as usual.\"</p>, <p>Test dummy?</p>, <p>I looked at Leon who looked back at me. His expression didn't say much, but his subtle nod told me all that I needed to know.</p>, <p>Ah.</p>, <p>So that's how it is.</p>, <p>I was just about to speak, when all of a sudden, Leon spoke.</p>, <p>\".....It isn't the case this time.\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"You're still defending him? Even after-\"</p>, <p>\"He told me a joke.\"</p>, <p>Uh?</p>, <p>Both me and Evelyn were taken aback.</p>, <p>A joke?</p>, <p>I looked at Leon who looked back at me. What is this guy on about?</p>, <p>Though his expression seemed indifferent, his eyes seemed to say, 'Roll with it.'</p>, <p>Roll with it...?</p>, <p>\"...A joke?\"</p>, <p>I felt Evelyn's gaze on me. She was staring at me with a face of utter disappointment.</p>, <p>I didn't understand why she was looking at me like that, but I felt like I needed to play along.</p>, <p>So,</p>, <p>\"Yeah, I did.\"</p>, <p>I went along with it.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>All it brought was silence from her. One that she broke shortly after.</p>, <p>\".....Do I look that easy to you?\"</p>, <p>I felt my skin crawl all of a sudden. If before she looked at me in disappointment, she was now looking at me with scorn.</p>, <p>\"I'm seriously asking.

On the outside, it was as if I had said something trivial.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>Evelyn didn't seem to think of it the same way. After a brief moment of silence, she managed to force a weak smile.</p>, <p>\".....I guess you truly do think of me as a joke.\"</p>, <p>Turning to look at Leon, she bowed her head. Then, without looking back she left.</p>, <p>Her back seemed rather frail when I looked at it.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>At first, they were slow.</p>, <p>Tak, tak.</p>, <p>The sound of her steps as her heels tapped against the marble floor.</p>, <p>Tak, tak, tak.</p>, <p>But they soon hurried.</p>, <p>Her head was lowered the entire time. She could see her expression through the polished floor of the campus hall.</p>, <p>\"Hah...\"</p>, <p>The burning in her chest didn't seem to ease no matter how long she walked. Her vision blurred and her lips stung.</p>, <p>\"B-bastard.\"</p>, <p>Her feet eventually came to a stop.</p>, <p>A person stood in front of her.</p>, <p>\"....Are you okay?\"</p>, <p>It was her knight, Natasha. Standing tall, her platinum hair and crystal eyes made her stand out from the rest. Nobles had a unique perk when joining the institute. They were allowed to bring a personal attendant.</p>, <p>In Evelyn's case, she was able to bring Natasha with her. It was a precaution the noble houses took considering the political importance each child held within their houses.</p>, <p>The Verlice family was one of the five Viscount families within the Empire. They naturally were able to provide her with a powerful knight as her escort.</p>, <p>\"Was it him?\"</p>, <p>And as her knight, she was naturally aware of her circumstances.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's silence told many things.</p>, <p>Natasha's grip on her sword tightened.</p>, <p>\"So it was...\"</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>A name tingled the tip of her tongue.</p>, <p>His relationship with Evelyn was hard to describe. At one point, the two were close. Almost inseparable.</p>, <p>But things changed after a certain point.</p>, <p>His personality changed, and his lust for power started to display. He changed, and his spiral started to affect Evelyn who could do nothing but watch.</p>, <p>It eventually ended with her cutting ties with him.</p>, <p>That was five years ago.</p>, <p>\"....You know, I thought he could've changed.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn let out a strained laugh.</p>, <p>\"I was naive, wasn't I...? In the end, it's always like this... H-hah.\"</p>, <p>Her chest trembled.</p>, <p>So did her lips.</p>, <p>\"Disappointment after another.\"</p>, <p>Her lips were tucked under her teeth.</p>, <p>\"...In the end, I was made fun of by him.\"</p>, <p>She looked up to face Natasha. Unlike before, her eyes seemed a little clearer but they were still a little misty.</p>, <p>Natasha's grip on her sword tightened.</p>, <p>That bastard...</p>, <p>\"Do you know what he said to me?\"</p>, <p>Natasha shook her head.</p>, <p>\"....Why don't they play poker in the jungle?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>Natasha blinked, unable to understand what was going on. Poker? Jungle...?</p>, <p>But Evelyn continued.</p>, <p>\"Too many cheetahs.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's shoulders trembled as she lowered her head. Natasha's expression changed all of a sudden.</p>, <p>\"Young misss...?\"</p>, <p>Fearing the worst, she approached her.</p>, <p>\"Are yo-\"</p>, <p>But stopped herself halfway.</p>, <p>That was because,</p>, <p>\"Uht.\"</p>, <p>Uth...?</p>, <p>\"Young miss...?\"</p>, <p>Holding her mouth, a strained sound escaped Evelyn's lips. Natasha was taken aback. What's going on...? And just before she could do anything, Evelyn's shoulders trembled even more.</p>, <p>\"Young...?\"</p>, <p>\"....Kaht.\"</p>, <p>Khat...?</p>, <p>Another sound came out of her mouth.</p>, <p>Natasha felt her stomach drop.</p>, <p>\"What-\"</p>, <p>Her hand reached out for her, when...</p>, <p>\"Puchi...!\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's cheek's deflated and a laugh escaped her lips.</p>, <p>\"Hehe-he\"</p>, <p>Even her laugh seemed strained. She looked up at Natasha, tears rolling down her eyes.</p>, <p>\"I do-n't even know what is happening to me...\"</p>, <p>A sharp pain pierced her chest as she continued to laugh.</p>, <p>Her hand reached to her shirt and clenched it.</p>, <p>\"W-why am I like this...? Hehe... The joke is bad so why...\"</p>, <p>She looked helplessly at Natasha. The tears continued to roll down her eyes, and the pain in her chest intensified.</p>, <p>\"He...

Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I sat down on the ground and shifted my right hand forward.</p>, <p>Closing my eyes, I channeled my mana.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</p>, <p>\".....Alright.\"</p>, <p>I swallowed again.</p>, <p>\"Let's start.\"</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"...Come.\"</p>, <p>Nothing came out of my hand.</p>, <p>I could feel the mana in my core.</p>, <p>It was there.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"I've got to do it.\"</p>, <p>It just wouldn't flow.</p>, <p>\"....Why?\"</p>, <p>My hand started to visibly tremble.</p>, <p>So did my lips.</p>, <p>\"He-h... Come on... Come out.\"</p>, <p>I thought back at what I did in the past.</p>, <p>I tried to repeat it.</p>, <p>Having done it hundreds of times over the past week, surely I could do it, right?</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"...It's not coming out.\"</p>, <p>The mana simply refused to move along my body.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I knew the reason why.</p>, <p>I just didn't want to acknowledge it.</p>, <p>\"...C-come on. Just a little.\"</p>, <p>I swallowed yet again.</p>, <p>\"No... N-no.\"</p>, <p>My mind kept wandering back to moments ago.</p>, <p>When I failed.</p>, <p>And the pain that came after it.</p>, <p>It replayed in my mind.</p>, <p>Over.</p>, <p>And over again.</p>, <p>\"...It's nothing.\"</p>, <p>As if it was a tape on replay.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>In the end.</p>, <p>I was afraid.</p>, <p>Afraid of my efforts going to waste like before.</p>, <p>\"What am I even doing this for...?\"</p>, <p>To the point where I started to question my own objectives.</p>, <p>Why was I doing so much?</p>, <p>Was it because I was just that desperate for answers? Was that the reason why I was pushing myself so hard?</p>, <p>For answers?</p>, <p>Was I really someone who would push themselves to this point just for answers?</p>, <p>\"....No.\"</p>, <p>How laughable.</p>, <p>Of course, it wasn't.</p>, <p>Deep down, I knew the answer. Why I was pushing myself so hard. Even if it was at the cost of my own sanity and body.</p>, <p>\"Go back.\"</p>, <p>The words escaped from my lips.</p>, <p>Almost as if they were in a whisper.</p>, <p>\"Brother.\"</p>, <p>An image conjured in my mind.</p>, <p>One of a young boy.</p>, <p>Sixteen years old.</p>, <p>And alone.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>What I wanted wasn't an answer.</p>, <p>It was a way back.</p>, <p>I...</p>, <p>\"Kh...!\"</p>, <p>Mana flowed out from my core.</p>, <p>My entire body shivered as a result. The world started to become a blur, and I could hardly make out what was real and what was fake.</p>, <p>But that didn't deter me from training.</p>, <p>I had a goal in mind.</p>, <p>One that I had to achieve.</p>, <p>So even though I was afraid. My body hurt. And I was exhausted.</p>, <p>\"....Kh.\"</p>, <p>I continued to push myself.</p>, <p>I had no choice.</p>, <p>I...</p>, <p>Had to do it.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>A plume of smoke floated in the air.</p>, <p>Long flowing platinum hair, deep red eyes, curvaceous body. Kiera Mylne casually sat on the stairs of the Rondeo Dorms.</p>, <p>It was a building only the top rankers were allowed to be in.</p>, <p>She was one of them.</p>, <p>That said,</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>They didn't allow one to smoke inside.</p>, <p>She had no choice but to smoke outside.</p>, <p>\"...Fucking bullshit.\"</p>, <p>It was an irritating thought. For such a grand and luxurious building... How could they not allow her to smoke?</p>, <p>Like, seriously.</p>, <p>What did she pay so much to attend this place for?</p>, <p>\"Maybe if I was the Black Star....\"</p>, <p>She thought back to the Black Star. Julien of the Evenus Barony. Maybe he could smoke in his room?</p>, <p>It was a thought that entertained her for a bit.</p>, <p>At first glance, he seemed quite arrogant.</p>, <p>Enough to infuriate practically every first-year cadet.</p>, <p>But unlike the others, she wasn't particularly interested in such meaningless squabbles.</p>, <p>\"Pfttt.\"</p>, <p>Rather, she found him to be somewhat funny.</p>, <p>\"Fucking jokes.\"</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>The plume of smoke drifted in the air as she took another drag of the cigarette.</p>, <p>Kiera, who was enjoying herself at the steps of the building, suddenly raised her head, catching a glimpse of an approaching figure.</p>, <p>She was quick to flick the cigarette away.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>There was a certain aura about the approaching figure that attracted the gazes of all those around. Her graceful movements exuded a sense of authority, flowing with sophistication and ease, concealing any hint of her flaws.</p>, <p>It was a figure she knew all too well. How could she not know her...?</p>, <p>A woman of the Megrail family.</p>, <p>The Princess of the Empire.</p>, <p>Aoife Kell Megrail.</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>Though she was in a class of her own, Kiera couldn't help but click her tongue. Her foot dragged over to where the cigarette was and she stepped on it.</p>, <p>Twisting her foot slightly.</p>, <p>Kiera looked down on her. As a noble of high lineage, she was well acquainted with Aoife. They had met many times in past events.</p>, <p>She shone brightly wherever she went. Was always the spotlight.</p>, <p>That didn't bother Kiera much.</p>, <p>...Not until the day of her coming to age ceremony and her talent was made known to Aoife and the royal family.</p>, <p>As a result?</p>, <p>She, who was supposed to have started her training at age fourteen, was forced to train at seventeen. The same age as low-end nobles.</p>, <p>For what reason...?</p>, <p>'This bitch.'</p>, <p>\"Cadet.\"</p>, <p>Aoife stopped in front of her. Her yellow eyes slowly sank down to meet Kiera's gaze. Her expression didn't say much.</p>, <p>It was hard to read.</p>, <p>There was nothing unusual about this. She had always been like this. A blank piece of paper with hardly any thoughts.</p>, <p>And the thought irritated Kiera even more.</p>, <p>\"....What.\"</p>, <p>\"Can you move?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Kiera blinked and looked around. Then she realized. She was blocking the entrance.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'Is that all....?'</p>, <p>No form of acknowledgment. A name? Just... Cadet? They had met several times in the past. Even made brief conversation. It was complete disregard.</p>, <p>\"Cadet?\"</p>, <p>\"Hehe.\"</p>, <p>Kiera pursed her lips and smiled. It was a bright smile. One of the brightest she had ever displayed.</p>, <p>And what followed after her smile was...</p>, <p>\"Fuck you.\"</p>, <p>A middle finger.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>Sweat intermixed with my blood.</p>, <p>My eyes stung.</p>, <p>And my vision was blurred.</p>, <p>A day had passed. It was now early in the morning.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>Tzz----</p>, <p>\"....Failed.\"</p>, <p>I was met with another failure.</p>, <p>The result of my efforts was the connection of eight runes. A result that was far beneath my desired goal.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I thought about continuing again, when...</p>, <p>To Tok--!</p>, <p>The door knocked.</p>, <p>\"Young master.\"</p>, <p>And a familiar voice sounded.</p>, <p>\"...So it's time.\"</p>, <p>There could only be one reason for him to call me. The first day of the Academy was about to start.</p>, <p>\"I'm comin-Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>My legs gave out when I tried to stand up.</p>, <p>Fortunately, I was able to stop myself from falling face flat on the floor by grasping the side of the sofa.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My breaths were heavy and my hands were unusually pale.</p>, <p>It was obvious that my body was in poor condition.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking another breath I forced myself into the shower. I stumbled several times in the process before finally making it to the valve where I turned on the cold water.</p>, <p>Shaaa--!</p>, <p>My skin prickled at the cold.</p>, <p>But at the same time, my mind regained some clarity.</p>, <p>Supporting myself with both hands on the wall, I let the water trickle down my back.</p>, <p>One might think I'd be distressed with the results of my training.</p>, <p>In some ways I was.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Almost.\"</p>, <p>At the same time, I was also thrilled.</p>, <p>It wasn't fruitless.</p>, <p>There was definitely a progression.</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>I laughed out in exasperation.</p>, <p>It was going to take time, but I knew I could do it.</p>, <p>I was that desperate.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The campus was large. It took me about five minutes to get to the main building from the dorms.</p>, <p>[Dorset Hall]</p>, <p>That was where we were supposed to be.</p>, <p>It was one of the seven halls of the institute and where first-year cadets attended their lessons.</p>, <p>\".....What class are we in?\"</p>, <p>The Hall was large.</p>, <p>It was one big building with a pathway flanked by vibrant flowers and trees that guided toward the entrance, where a row of statues stood in solemn formation.</p>, <p>It overflowed with students.</p>, <p>Most troublesome were the gazes they looked at me with. Some avoided me, while others seemed to be openly hostile.</p>, <p>I was fine with that.</p>, <p>It came as a result of my actions on the first day.</p>, <p>\"Our class should be there.\"</p>, <p>Leon pointed towards a certain door. At first glance, it didn't seem all that impressive.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Why is there nobody going there?\"</p>, <p>Unlike the other classrooms, which were open and filled with cadets passing through, this one seemed rather isolated. As if people were avoiding it.</p>, <p>\"....Did you not read the manual?\"</p>, <p>\"Manual...? Ah.\"</p>, <p>I took a small leaflet from my pocket. I remember receiving it yesterday, but because my focus had been on my training, I forgot all about it.</p>, <p>\"This?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>, <p>I scanned through the contents.</p>, <p>In short.</p>, <p>\"We're late.\"</p>, <p>\".....That's right.\"</p>, <p>\"And you didn't tell me about it?\"</p>, <p>\"I thought you were aware.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>There were times when I just really wanted to strangle this guy.</p>, <p>If not for the fact that he was helping me and that he was stronger, I'd already be at it.</p>, <p>That said,</p>, <p>'I wonder what his end goal is...'</p>, <p>I was still not sure why he was helping me. He said something about it benefiting him.</p>, <p>How so?</p>, <p>'As expected, I still can't trust him.'</p>, <p> The same was true for him to me.</p>, <p>In a way, we weren't that much different.</p>, <p>Staring at the door to the classroom, I sighed.</p>, <p>I felt strangely nervous. It wasn't so much because I was scared of people challenging me. I was fine with that. What I was nervous about was my abilities.</p>, <p>They were not up to par at that moment.</p>, <p>I was probably the weakest cadet present.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>After secretly collecting my breath, I slowly and carefully approached the door.</p>, <p>Creaaak--</p>, <p>The interior was sleek; long wooden desks lined up the sides, cascading up. They were all filled to the brim, with barely any empty spots.</p>, <p>Immediately, all eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>They were burdensome. But the most burdensome of them all was the one that belonged to the woman in front of me.</p>, <p>Most likely, our instructor.</p>, <p>\"Cadets.\"</p>, <p>Her crystal blue eyes shifted between Leon and me. She had short brown hair and seemed to be in her mid-forties.</p>, <p>Alternating her gaze between the two of us she finally opened her mouth to say,</p>, <p>\"....You're late.\"</p>, <p>I was already aware.</p>, <p>Things would've been easier if I just apologized, but I recalled Leon's description of the previous Julien and answered flatly,</p>, <p>\"That seems to be the case.\"</p>, <p>\"Seems to be the case...?\"</p>, <p>My answer left her exasperated as she made a face. I felt a little sorry for her, but I didn't show it on the outside and kept my face stoic.</p>, <p>She opened her mouth but closed it right after.</p>, <p>\"Just go. Take a seat.\"</p>, <p>\".....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>I did just that.</p>, <p>Finding the nearest seat I could find, I sat down and took a breath.</p>, <p>That was easier than I expected.</p>, <p>She was probably a lenient teacher. Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"You're late! Get out of my class!\"</p>, <p>Staring at the student who had just entered the class and got kicked out, I opened my mouth to say something when I realized I couldn't say anything.</p>, <p>Why....?</p>, <p>I looked to my left, where Leon sat. He looked at me and then shrugged.</p>, <p>\"Probably our looks.\"</p>, <p>Oh.</p>, <p>The lecture resumed.</p>, <p>\"Continuing from where I was... As you all are currently aware, magic is subdivided into three different categories. [Mind], [Elemental], and [Body].\"</p>, <p>The classroom fell into silence.</p>, <p>The instructor's voice smoothly echoed throughout the classroom.</p>, <p>\"Each category is further divided into subcategories. Take the [Mind] classification as an example. With the [Emotive], [Telekinesis], [Spirit], and [Telepathy] it contains a total of four sub-categories. Or some like to say, 'paths'.\"</p>, <p>I strained my ears to listen closely to the lecture. All information was vital. I needed to pay close attention to all that was being said.</p>, <p>\"....As is known, everyone can practice magic. If you can manipulate mana, you have the qualifications to become a magician or knight. That of course, isn't a problem for all of you present.\"</p>, <p>She seemed to eye certain students; her gaze eventually falling on me.</p>, <p>\"Talent is merely a factor that indicates the rate of your improvement. It does not limit you in the practice of other paths.\"</p>, <p>I took note of this piece of information in my mind.</p>, <p>My talents currently lie in the [Curse] and [Emotive] subcategories.</p>, <p>If it was possible for me to practice things outside of those two categories, then it was worth considering for the future.</p>, <p>\"Now, time for a question.\"</p>, <p>The lecturer looked around the classroom. I felt her gaze linger in my direction for a brief moment.</p>, <p>What sort of...?</p>, <p>She smiled.</p>, <p>\"Of all the categories, which do you deem to be the weakest?\"</p>, <p>The weakest?</p>, <p>Murmurs filled the classroom as the students discussed among themselves.</p>, <p>Eventually, one of the cadets raised their hands. He stood out immediately with his tall height, blonde hair, and blue eyes.</p>, <p>The fact that his appearance garnered the attention of many of the people present told me all that I needed to know about him.</p>, <p>He was strong.</p>, <p>Probably amongst the higher-ranked cadets.</p>, <p>\"Yes? Cadet Anders.\"</p>, <p>Oh?</p>, <p>I suddenly felt his gaze.</p>, <p>As his mouth parted open, he answered slowly. As if he wanted me to hear his answer.</p>, <p>\"....Emotive.\"</p>, <p>A clear provocation.</p>, <p>Multiple eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>\"Emotive?\"</p>, <p>The instructor's gaze fell on me for a moment. She seemed to have been influenced by the others in the class.</p>, <p>\"What makes you think that's the case?\"</p>, <p>\"It's the longest category to learn. Not only that, but you must be able to touch your opponent to influence their emotions. If they can't touch you, they're useless.\"</p>, <p>\"That's not the case.\"</p>, <p>With a shake of her head, the instructor corrected,</p>, <p>\"That's merely on the basis that they are on the first level of mastery. At a higher stage, they can influence someone with mere words. Further down the path, and they can read emotions.\"</p>, <p>I listened to her words carefully.</p>, <p>The [Emotive] sub-category was still an enigma to me. Unlike with my [Curse] sub-category, I couldn't practice it through repetition training.</p>, <p>The only way for me to further the [Emotive] path was through the understanding of emotions. The more I understood, the more I improved.</p>, <p>But that was easier said than done.</p>, <p>'Now that I think about it... She mentioned something about first-level mastery.'</p>, <p>I was reminded of the notifications I received almost daily.</p>, <p>The only regarding [Fear] and Exp.</p>, <p>'....So if I improve it, I'll be able to influence people with words?'</p>, <p>The thought excited me for some reason.</p>, <p>Was there more to it?</p>, <p>The Cadet continued,</p>, <p>\"That is indeed true, but it's also true that it's not easy to achieve. It may take a lot of years to get to a level where one can influence another's emotions. To be able to influence them through words?\"</p>, <p>He scoffed.</p>, <p>\"...You will need to be as old as my father to be able to get there.\"</p>, <p>\"That's not necessarily true.\"</p>, <p>The instructor shook her head.</p>, <p>\"There are many cases where people achieve such a state at a young age. Keep in mind, that there are states above that. Being able to influence someone through words is still considered entry level.\"</p>, <p>Entry level...?</p>, <p>Influencing with words was just entry-level?</p>, <p>I thought back to my powers. Ever since the examination, I had hardly touched the other field.</p>, <p>It wasn't because I didn't like it.</p>, <p>That was the furthest thing from the truth.</p>, <p>The reality was that I was unsure whether I was capable of handling it. The after-effect from last time left a scar in my mind.</p>, <p>Like a mental block, it made me avoid it.</p>, <p>I was just not ready.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'You're telling me I merely scratched the surface of what's possible?'</p>, <p>\"Cadet Julien.\"</p>, <p>Feeling the instructor's gaze, I turned to face her.</p>, <p>\"....As an Emotive Mage yourself, what do you think about Cadet Anders's answer?\"</p>, <p>What did I think about it?</p>, <p>He's right.</p>, <p>All his words made sense. From what I experienced, he was right in absolutely every way.</p>, <p>The [Emotive] field was a path that would probably take someone ages to master.</p>, <p>It encompassed all the experiences of one's life and molded them in the form of emotions. Unless someone constantly experiences all those emotions, they won't be able to improve.</p>, <p>In that regard, it was the weakest of all the other paths.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I turned my wrist slightly.</p>, <p>My eyes fell on the clover tattoo.</p>, <p>Was that the same for me?</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The classroom fell silent.</p>, <p>They all were seemingly awaiting my answer. 'What's he going to say?', 'How will he answer with?'</p>, <p>Their faces all said the same thing.</p>, <p>And I looked back to face the cadet.</p>, <p>Anders was it?</p>, <p>I found the corner of my lips lifting slightly.</p>, <p>\"....It's bullshit.\"</p>, <p>An answer flowed out of my mouth.</p>, <p>\"Weakest? There's no such thing.\"</p>, <p>I wasn't just bullshitting at the moment.</p>, <p>These were my true thoughts.</p>, <p>\"There's only a weak person. No weak path.\"</p>, <p>Just because the Emotive field was the hardest to progress in didn't mean it was the weakest class.</p>, <p>From the start, the question was wrong.</p>, <p>\"You say that it takes a lot of time for an Emotive mage to be strong. On what basis do you say that?\"</p>, <p>\"What basis?\"</p>, <p>The Cadet looked at me as if I were stupid.</p>, <p>\"It's common sense. Take a look at all the strongest mages in the world. Our Empire has seven Monarchs. How many of them are from the Emotive field? None!\"</p>, <p>He pointed his finger at me.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, he started talking about something different.</p>, <p>Most probably what he wanted to say from the start.</p>, <p>\".....Do you think none of us see it? Your mana flow is weak. You don't even seem to be capable of properly controlling your mana. On good god, I don't know why you're ranked first.\"</p>, <p>His words seemed to echo the thoughts of many of the people present in the classroom, with many of them nodding along.</p>, <p>I took in the sight.</p>, <p>\"My best guess is because of your achievements in the Emotive field. Even then, I doubt you'll be able to do anything to me.\"</p>, <p>When he finally said what he wanted to say, with a look of scorn, he added,</p>, <p>\"Simply put, you're not fit for the role. You're weak.\"</p>, <p>Once again, the room fell into silence.</p>, <p>All eyes were trained on me.</p>, <p>\"Haaa....\"</p>, <p>With all attention on me, I leaned my head back and closed my eyes.</p>, <p>'....So they noticed.'</p>, <p>It wasn't as though I didn't expect it.</p>, <p>Everyone must've noticed it during the first day. The fact that I was weak. That I wasn't on the same level as them.</p>, <p>I understood this even more clearly than they did.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I provoked everyone.</p>, <p>Trained to the point of insanity.</p>, <p>His words made sense, and there was nothing wrong with them.</p>, <p>Still,</p>, <p>\"You're wrong.\"</p>, <p>My eyes were still closed, so I couldn't see.</p>, <p>All that I saw was darkness.</p>, <p>In that darkness, I could feel my hand move towards my forearm. Where the four-leaved clover rested.</p>, <p>I was a little hesitant at first, but then, I was reminded of my goal.</p>, <p>That was when my mind became firm.</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>To achieve my goal, I need to make full use of all the advantages I have.</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>My finger pressed down on my forearm.</p>, <p>'...Nobody but me can be the Black Star.'</p>]\n",

But... was that really the case?</p>, <p>Was what I was seeing truly fake?...Or was this the reality of his life now?</p>, <p>\"Y-you're enjoying your food?\"</p>, <p>He never looked back.</p>, <p>It was as if he couldn't look back.</p>, <p>But I could see it.</p>, <p>His shoulders... They were shaking. Even more than before.</p>, <p>\".....Why?\"</p>, <p>I was running out of breath, and my vision blurred. A pain unlike any other invaded my body.</p>, <p>Why did it have to be like this?</p>, <p>Rustle</p>, <p>A rustling caught my attention.</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>If not for the fact that I was rooted on the spot, I would've stood up immediately.</p>, <p>\"Noel!\"</p>, <p>I shouted at the top of my lungs. Panic flooded every part of me as I tried to wrestle against the chains that kept me on the seat.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>My voice didn't reach him.</p>, <p>\"Stop! Stop now!!! You can't...!\"</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>It couldn't reach him.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Against his temple, Noel held a gun.</p>, <p>\"No, no, no, no, no...\"</p>, <p>What was this?</p>, <p>What am I seeing?</p>, <p>How did he...</p>, <p>Ahhhh.</p>, <p>\"Heyyy!!!\"</p>, <p>It was as if a piece of my heart was being torn. Scraped off. My neck twisted, and the veins on my neck protruded.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing!?\"</p>, <p>Stop!</p>, <p>Stop....!</p>, <p>\".....I'm tired.\"</p>, <p>Noel remained motionless.</p>, <p>His voice seemed to be devoid of anything. As if he had lost track of himself.</p>, <p>\"No, don't! I... Ah!\"</p>, <p>\"Hey, brother...\"</p>, <p>Finally, he turned to look at me.</p>, <p>That was when I stopped my struggles.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>His face was stained with tears. But the scariest part was his eyes... They were empty. Devoid of any of the usual spark he had.</p>, <p>Ah, no...</p>, <p>\".....Why did you leave me?\"</p>, <p>I knew he wasn't addressing me. There was nobody in the room. It was just him. He was talking to himself.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I felt compelled to respond.</p>, <p>\"I didn't choose to leave.\"</p>, <p>\"Right, you had no choice.\"</p>, <p>He answered in a manner that suggested he could hear me. But I knew he couldn't.</p>, <p>After all, he wasn't looking at me.</p>, <p>\"It's cold. Lonely. I have nobody. Our parents died. You were the only one left. Now that you're gone... Nobody cares.\"</p>, <p>\"....Ah.\"</p>, <p>My chest pounded.</p>, <p>The pain seemed to strangle the words out of me.</p>, <p>\"I-I'm scared...\"</p>, <p>Drip.</p>, <p>\"I don't know what to do... Why does everyone leave me...? What did I do? Am I the problem... Is that it?\"</p>, <p>No, that's not...</p>, <p>\"Hehe...\"</p>, <p>A hollow laugh escaped his lips.</p>, <p>\".....I should just end it, right? That way... I won't be alone anymore. At worst, I'll be with darkness. It's nothing different than now.\"</p>, <p>\"No!!\"</p>, <p>I finally snapped out of it.</p>, <p>What replaced the pain that entangled my heart was another emotion.</p>, <p>Anger.</p>, <p>I knew he couldn't listen, but I still spoke.</p>, <p>No, shouted.</p>, <p>\"You fucking idiot...!! I stopped everything so that you could live better.\"</p>, <p>My chemotherapy.</p>, <p>.....I stopped it because I wanted him to live a better life. He had enough savings to survive until he finished school. So... how could he just end it?</p>, <p>Was my sacrifice for nothing!?</p>, <p>No, no...!</p>, <p>\"Fuck!!! Stop!\"</p>, <p>\".....If you were here, you'd probably scold me. Tell me how much of a fucking idiot I am, right?\"</p>, <p>I lost my voice then.</p>, <p>\"Did I ask you to step chemo? Do you think I've ever cared about the money...?\"</p>, <p>No, that's...</p>, <p>\"That was just an excuse from you wasn't it?\"</p>, <p>\"....What?\"</p>, <p>\"You were scared.\"</p>, <p>I felt myself lose my breath.</p>, <p>\".....No.\"</p>, <p>\"You stopped chemo because you lost sight of yourself. You were afraid of spending your days meaninglessly, knowing that you had no future to look forward to. You chose the fastest way to leave. Leaving money for me... That was just an excuse you probably told yourself.\"</p>, <p>\"No, that's...\"</p>, <p>\".....I know it. After all, I'm just like you now.\"</p>, <p>That...</p>, <p>I brought my hand toward my chest.</p>, <p>It hurt.</p>, <p>It hurt so much.</p>, <p>The pain was taking over me.</p>, <p>\"Haaa.... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My vision blurred, and every single breath was accompanied by even more pain.</p>, <p>Noel's hand shook.</p>, <p>\"...Since you can run, I can too, right?\"</p>, <p>He looked at me.</p>, <p>This time, it really felt like he could see me.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Tears, uninvited, welled up, and my mouth trembled. What was this? How could speaking hurt so much...?</p>, <p>\"You won't mind if I join you, right?\"</p>, <p>\"....No, no.\"</p>, <p>My voice came out weak.</p>, <p>I found that I could no longer shout. The energy drained from my body. This sense of helplessness...</p>, <p>It slowly carved itself into my mind.</p>, <p>So did the pain.</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>Noel smiled. In a way, his smile seemed liberating. But all I could feel was helplessness. I could feel myself breaking.</p>, <p>The colors started to drain from the world.</p>, <p>I could see the younger version of him, standing before me, asking me to buy him ice cream. It was just a couple of months after our parent's death.</p>, <p>It was just the two of us back then.</p>, <p>He had only been ten back then. I remember that day clearly because... That was the day he regained his smile.</p>, <p>I worked hard to keep it that way.</p>, <p>To make it so that he wouldn't stop smiling.</p>, <p>So...</p>, <p>Staring at the sight before me, I felt myself lose my breath.</p>, <p>His smile. The one I promised to keep.</p>, <p>It was gone.</p>, <p>I took it away from him.</p>, <p>\"It... hurts.\"</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>I flinched. My breath seemed to be caught in my throat as the gun fell from Noel's hand. His eyes, which appeared to be devoid of any light, lowered.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>And tears continuously poured down from them.</p>, <p>Biting his lips, he weakly leaned back.</p>, <p>\"I... I'm scared.\"</p>, <p>He covered his face with both hands.</p>, <p>\"I don't want to die.\"</p>, <p>His shoulders trembled.</p>, <p>\"...But I don't want to live.\"</p>, <p>The world seemed to grow faint.</p>, <p>\"W-what do I do...?\"</p>, <p>Just before it all faded, his head turned to face my direction once more.</p>, <p>\"....Tell me, brother. What do I do?\"</p>, <p>That was the last time I heard his voice.</p>, <p>Brightness engulfed my vision and I found myself in a familiar place.</p>, <p>All eyes were fixed on me.</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>But all I could feel was pain.</p>, <p>My chest felt tight and heavy.</p>, <p>Each breath felt heavier than the last.</p>, <p>And my vision was blurry.</p>, <p>It was at that point that I closed my eyes and saw a notification.</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 2. [Sadness] EXP + 15%</p>, <p>'Level 2...?'</p>, <p>At first, I was surprised, but then I understood.</p>, <p>Unlike fear, I was familiar with sadness. It was all I ever knew in my previous life. It was no wonder my understanding of it was greater than fear or any other emotion.</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, I opened my eyes.</p>, <p>\"...When was the last time that you cried?\"</p>, <p>Words flowed out of my mouth all of a sudden. They came out smoother than I thought.</p>, <p>They were directed towards one person.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? What are—Huh? Eh... Ah...\"</p>, <p>He stopped mid-sentence.</p>, <p>A strange silence filled my surroundings.</p>, <p>One that was broken by me as I stood up from my seat. Under the eyes of all present, I walked up the aisles before stopping in front of him.</p>, <p>His focus wasn't on me.</p>, <p>\"T-this... Wha-t is this...?\"</p>, <p>Flustered, he touched his cheeks.</p>, <p>They were stained with tears.</p>, <p>Gripping his shirt, he looked up at me.</p>, <p>\"W-what's going on? What did you do?\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer.</p>, <p>Instead, I asked,</p>, <p>\"Did I touch you?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah... H-ah.\"</p>, <p>The tears streamed with even more force as his face paled.</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth and raised my head. Recollections of the scene I witnessed replayed in my mind, threatening to force tears out of my eyes.</p>, <p>But I held them in.</p>, <p>I let the pain center towards my chest, where it had all accumulated.</p>, <p>Instead, I directed my attention towards Anders.</p>, <p>I opened my arms.</p>, <p>\"....You say I'm weak.\"</p>, <p>Unfitting of my rank.</p>, <p>\"Here's your chance. Hit me. \"</p>, <p>\"Uekh... I...\"</p>, <p>With his hand on his chest, he only looked at me.</p>, <p>I looked back at him.</p>, <p>\"So you can't...?\"</p>, <p>I reached my hand forward to grasp his shoulder. He flinched at the touch but wasn't able to free himself from it.</p>, <p>\"Tell me.\"</p>, <p>He seemed to be in too much pain to answer.</p>, <p>I could relate.</p>, <p>My body was being eaten from the inside. The pain was unbearable, and every second I stood felt like torture.</p>, <p>But I still held myself.</p>, <p>I couldn't show weakness.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>I then recalled the words he threw at me before this; 'Even then, I doubt you'll be able to do anything to me.'</p>, <p>That was when I asked,</p>, <p>\"....Am I doing something now?\"</p>, <p>He didn't answer.</p>, <p>Squeezing his shoulder, I murmured,</p>, <p>\"I thought so.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>Tears stained the floor.</p>, <p>Their gentle drip echoing throughout the otherwise quiet room.</p>, <p>Those tears...</p>, <p>\"Ah... I...\"</p>, <p>They weren't my tears.</p>, <p>\"...Do you still think I'm weak?\"</p>, <p>Every word that came out of my mouth seemed to liberate me from the pain that was engulfing my chest.</p>, <p>But it wasn't enough.</p>, <p>That's why I squeezed his shoulder. It helped me alleviate the pain further while, at the same time, keeping me from falling. It was hard to remain standing.</p>, <p>\"Ukh... Ah... W-what did you do...?\"</p>, <p>Helplessness marred his features as he looked at me.</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth. My eyes felt moist. The tears were trying their best to escape my eyes. But I didn't let them.</p>, <p>I kept my eyes fixed on him.</p>, <p>\"There's only a weak person. No weak path.\"</p>, <p>I repeated the same words I said before.</p>, <p>His expression changed, and the tears continued to pour down his face. But... I could see anger interweaving with the sadness.</p>, <p>\"You, you...\"</p>, <p>His lips quivered.</p>, <p>He struggled to make eye contact with me. That didn't last for long and his jaw clenched tightly, and his expression twisted.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>My face stung, and my head turned. His fist reached my cheek, pushing it to the side. Even so, even as my head turned, I didn't look away. I kept my eyes on him.</p>, <p>It hurt.</p>, <p>But I was already being consumed by pain.</p>, <p>This was nothing compared to what I was currently experiencing.</p>, <p>It tickled.</p>, <p>\"...Am I weak?\"</p>, <p>I asked again.</p>, <p>His eyes faltered, and the anger seemed to fade. A new emotion started to invade his mind.</p>, <p>One that I was responsible for.</p>, <p>Fear.</p>, <p>The effect wasn't as powerful as the first time I used it. Nor was it as strong as sadness, but under the current circumstances, it was enough.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>Anger was slowly being replaced by fear.</p>, <p> His lips quivered, and his fist lowered. Finally, he looked away from me.</p>, <p>And that's when I finally muttered,</p>, <p>\".....Pathetic.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Coming out of the classroom, Aoife stopped by the statue that stood at the front of the Dorset Hall. Towering over her, it was an imposing statue. One that every student who passed couldn't help but notice.</p>, <p>It was the statue of the first emperor.</p>, <p>Dorset Gaius Megrail.</p>, <p>Her ancestor and the first Zenith.</p>, <p>Indeed, the blood of a Zenith flowed through her. A great honor that came with heavy responsibilities.</p>, <p>It had been centuries since a Zenith had been born into their family.</p>, <p>Their efforts at nurturing a Zenith had been in vain, and despite all their policies to keep others in check, the other houses were catching up.</p>, <p>In particular...</p>, <p>'Delilah Venice Rosemberg.'</p>, <p>A name stood out in her mind. She was the closest to the Zenith and the one with the power to end their reign.</p>, <p>\"...I won't fail.\"</p>, <p>To become the Zenith.</p>, <p>Aoife was willing to do anything.</p>, <p>It was her duty as a princess and her goal.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Students flowed out of the hall, with many of them glancing in her direction as they passed by. Ignoring them, she lowered her head to stare at her hand.</p>, <p>It was trembling.</p>, <p>Slightly.</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>Aoife's only question was 'Why'.</p>, <p>But at heart, she knew the reason for this.</p>, <p>She shut her eyes, allowing her mind to delve deep as she rewound the events that had unfolded earlier.</p>, <p>Anders Maddison.</p>, <p>...He was one of the cadets to look out for. Ranked within the top hundreds, he was a very talented individual, and someone Aoife kept in mind.</p>, <p>He was a talented person she thought of recruiting for her faction.</p>, <p>She was especially pleased by his boldness.</p>, <p>\"Simply put, you're not fit for the role. You're weak.\"</p>, <p>His bold words back then echoed the thoughts of everyone present.</p>, <p>The weakest Black Star.</p>, <p>That was who Julien Dacre Evenus was.</p>, <p>'Weak.'</p>, <p>He was truly weak.</p>, <p>To the point where one might wonder how he had managed to get himself into the position. It was a thought that consumed Aoife's mind over the past week.</p>, <p>How could someone as weak as him become the Black Star?</p>, <p>She could recall his expression back then. Under the barrage of Anders's words, he seemed calm. Unfazed, almost.</p>, <p>It was as if he truly didn't care.</p>, <p>But was that the case...?</p>, <p>Did he truly not care?</p>, <p>At the time, when she saw him close his eyes, Aoife thought, 'He's running away.' His actions again made her ask the question,</p>, <p>'Just what is so special about him...?'</p>, <p>His attitude was trash, his mana flow was weak, and he wasn't of high noble birth.</p>, <p>\".....Why?\"</p>, <p>She was confident that if the two of them were to fight one-on-one, she'd beat him with a simple flick of her finger.</p>, <p>He was that weak in her eyes.</p>, <p>The only one whom she truly deemed strong was not Julien, but his knight.</p>, <p>Leon Rowan Ellert.</p>, <p>He was ranked second, and unlike Julien, Aoife could see that he was strong. She couldn't see herself beating him easily. If she wanted to beat him, she'd have to pull out every card she had.</p>, <p>\"....When was the last time that you cried?\"</p>, <p>Even now, she could remember his voice. The tone, the smoothness, and the fluidity of it. It wasn't something she could forget.</p>, <p>Never.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? What are—Huh? Eh... Ah...\"</p>, <p>The way Ander's face changed at his words, and tears flowed out of his eyes...</p>, <p>She could also remember.</p>, <p>The change was so abrupt that hardly anyone was able to react. Aoife was one of the few who was able to understand what had happened.</p>, <p>By the time she did, however, Julien was already standing in front of him.</p>, <p>\"Did I touch you?\"</p>, <p>He didn't.</p>, <p>His every action seemed calculated. As if he were evoking a certain flow.</p>, <p>First he evoked sadness.</p>, <p>\"...When was the last time that you cried?\"</p>, <p>Then, he evoked anger.</p>, <p>\"Here's your chance. Hit me. \"</p>, <p>\"You, you...\"</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>And then...</p>, <p>\".....Pathetic.\"</p>, <p>He evoked fear.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Aoife opened her eyes.</p>, <p>\"The entire time, he was in complete control.\"</p>, <p>It was an unmistakable fact.</p>, <p>What made Emotive Mages so scary? It wasn't their strength. Far from it. They were weak. Even the weakest mage could kill them.</p>, <p>.....But that was only on the premise that they didn't fall for their words.</p>, <p>Through the exploitation of a single emotion, Emotive Mages could evoke and manipulate other emotions. Though different, they were all intertwined together. And the more emotions am Emotive Mage could manipulate, the stronger they were.</p>, <p>Emotions were a weakness.</p>, <p>It was something that Aoife understood all too well.</p>, <p>Aoife's fist slowly clenched.</p>, <p>\"He's weak.\"</p>, <p>That was undeniable.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\".....He's strong.\"</p>, <p>Weak but strong.</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>A new name crawled its way up in her mind.</p>, <p>It stood right alongside Delilah's.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A familiar feeling.</p>, <p>One that I had grown accustomed to.</p>, <p>My legs were weak.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Each breath felt tiring.</p>, <p>And the world felt empty.</p>, <p>Colorless.</p>, <p>It was just.... meaningless.

Will it hurt then?</p>, <p>Thoughts started to cloud my mind. They became more dangerous with each passing second. My mind was clear. I knew that my thoughts were stupid.</p>, <p>But... My insides were empty.</p>, <p>Just because my mind was clear, it didn't mean I cared.</p>, <p>Right now.</p>, <p>I just wanted to feel something.</p>, <p>Even if what I felt was pain. Something. I needed something. This emptiness that was consuming me... I wanted it to go away.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>My eyes continued to trace over the knife, just as my finger did.</p>, <p>It seemed tempting.</p>, <p>Just a little...?

It was, therefore, encouraged by the households to attend such gatherings.</p>, <p>All with the exception of a few people.</p>, <p>\"So you're here.\"</p>, <p>An exception to all of this was Leon. He was drenched from head to toe, sword in hand. In front of him stood a dummy, its body cut in two.</p>, <p>His movements came to a stop upon hearing the familiar voice behind him.</p>, <p>\"Evelyn? What brings you here?\"</p>, <p>\"...I can't train?\"</p>, <p>With a helpless shrug, she pointed toward the training dummies nearby. Seeing them, Leon made a look of understanding.</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>He proceeded to wipe the sweat from his forehead.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>An awkward silence followed suit.</p>, <p>Evelyn made an exasperated face when she looked at him.</p>, <p>\"I'm not going to talk about him.\"</p>, <p>\"...Yes?\"</p>, <p>\"I won't ask so you don't need to be so tense.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Was he that obvious...? For a moment, Leon struggled to answer.</p>, <p>\"I get it. You don't want to talk about him. I also don't want to talk about him. It doesn't always have to be about him.\"</p>, <p>\"...Is that so.\"</p>, <p>Leon's shoulders relaxed, and so did his expression.</p>, <p>\"How have you been?\"</p>, <p>Five years. That was how long the two hadn't seen each other.</p>, <p>The Evenus Household was one of the fastest-rising noble houses. Naturally, their circle was vast. The Verlice family was one of the families that they had gotten close to over the past years.</p>, <p>There was a time when there were talks between the houses to have Evelyn and Julien engaged.</p>, <p>That, however, fell through in the end.</p>, <p>\"Well... I've been good, I guess?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn shrugged and smiled wryly. Waving her hand, she pointed at the broken dummy.</p>, <p>\"Forget about me. I'm surprised that you managed to get the second seat. You've improved quite a lot. You could hardly hold the sword the last time I met you...\"</p>, <p>\"I've train--What's with that look?\"</p>, <p>\"So bland.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's face scrunched up.</p>, <p>\"...I didn't take you for such a bland guy.\"</p>, <p>She then mimicked his expression, going all stony.</p>, <p>\"I've trained. Worked hard~\"</p>, <p>And flexed her muscles.</p>, <p>Staring at the scene, Leon turned his head and covered his mouth with his fist.</p>, <p>\"...Kuhum. Sorry.\"</p>, <p>\"Please, the fact that you don't even realize...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's face changed and she stopped mid-sentence. Covering her mouth, she leaned closer.</p>, <p>\"...What?\"</p>, <p>\"What.\"</p>, <p>Leon turned his head further.</p>, <p>\"Don't tell me...\"</p>, <p>But Evely insisted.</p>, <p>\"You.\"</p>, <p>Finally catching a glimpse of his face, her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"You're blushing, aren't you? Wait, don't tell me you don't know that's how you react?\"</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>\"No way...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'Mirror dimension' -- A phenomenon that took over the continent of Aurora.</p>, <p>There wasn't much information regarding the Mirror Dimension. All that was known was that it expanded each year, slowly swallowing up the continent in the process.</p>, <p>From there, existences known as 'Children of the Dark' emerged into the continent.</p>, <p>These entities of chaos shook the very foundation of humanity, swallowing up territories at a fast pace.</p>, <p>The general situation was as such.</p>, <p>At least, that was how I understood things.</p>, <p>\"Although the situation sounds dire, the Empire is still holding up well. In fact, we've managed to regain some of our territories as of late. Which is why you need to memorize the monsters that are on the list. It'll be useful for you for when you enter the Mirror Dimension.\"</p>, <p>The class I was attending was called 'Heritage Recollection and Monster Analysis.' There were a lot of things to remember, from the history, monster types, classifications, and so on...</p>, <p>Looking at the long list of things that I needed to memorize I felt my head hurt a little.</p>, <p>It reminded me of the times back when I was in school.</p>, <p>That said, it didn't seem like I was the only one struggling.</p>, <p>Staring at the white-haired figure sitting a few rows ahead of me, I held myself back from laughing.</p>, <p>With a \"Unnng\" she ruffled her hair, muttering things like, 'I'm fucked. Should I just sell myself? Fuck, no. Shit...'</p>, <p>Just a lot of nonsense.</p>, <p>At that moment, as if she could sense my gaze, her head turned and our eyes met. My expression stiffened at the sight of her, and an image flashed in my mind.</p>, <p>'...It's her.'</p>, <p>One of the girls from the vision.</p>, <p>Before I could process the information, she tilted her head and mouthed, 'What are you looking at?'</p>, <p>I thought about answering but decided against it when I felt the professor's gaze pause on me.</p>, <p>Clicking her tongue, she returned her attention to the front.</p>, <p>The lecture continued from there.</p>, <p>It only ended when another hour passed. By then, I was mentally drained.</p>, <p>\"We've only covered a portion of the syllabus. We've still got a lot of things to go through. Please go back home and digest the information.\"</p>, <p>As if he wasn't satisfied, the lecturer added.</p>, <p>\"I'll review what you've learned in the next lecture.\"</p>, <p>A pained groan followed his exit as the white-haired girl gripped her head.</p>, <p>\"I'm fucked... I'm done. Shit. At this rate, I'll fail... Do I have no choice but to sell myself?\"</p>, <p>She looked around before settling her gaze toward the nearest boy.</p>, <p>\"Oy.\"</p>, <p>\"...Hm?\"</p>, <p>\"How much would you pay for me?\"</p>, <p>\"Eh?\"</p>, <p>Flustered, the boy took a step back. She didn't seem to mind and approached him. Her every action attracted the gaze of those around her. She was that pretty.</p>, <p>Too bad she was crazy.</p>, <p>Bat shit crazy.</p>, <p>\"How about this...\"</p>, <p>She leaned her elbow on his shoulder. Learning her head closer, she scratched her chin and nodded. As if she had just made a big decision.</p>, <p>\"You give me all your money, and in exchange, I'll let you hold my hand. How about it?\"</p>, <p>\"....Eh?\"</p>, <p>\"Is that a no?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>She clicked her tongue and proceeded to her next target. It went on like this for a while before she left with a gloomy look.</p>, <p>I thought about leaving, but the scene was rather entertaining. I wanted to know if anyone was willing to pay all their money just to hold her hand.</p>, <p>That, and...</p>, <p>The fact that I dreaded the next class.</p>, <p>[Dimension Diving]</p>, <p>As the name suggested, it was a class designated to emulate the environment of the 'Mirror Dimension'. While it wasn't the real deal, and the monsters were fake, it didn't mean that it was impossible to get injured.</p>, <p>Quite frankly.</p>, <p>I didn't want to go.</p>, <p>My skills were not up to par.</p>, <p>The only thing I could do was stay behind and watch.</p>, <p>\"Please gear yourself and put on your suits. We'll be starting in the next half hour.\"</p>, <p>A loud voice reminded me of the impending doom. Sighing to myself, I turned to look at Leon who had remained quiet the entire time. Turning his head to look at me, he raised his fist as if to say, 'Cheer up' before packing up his staff and heading for the door.</p>, <p>\"Hey, wait. Why are you leaving?\"</p>, <p>\"...Yes?\"</p>, <p>Leon stopped to look at me.</p>, <p>\"Aren't you supposed to be my knight?\"</p>, <p>Wasn't his entire job to protect me?</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>He nodded.</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>\"So...\"</p>, <p>\"...Are you going to file a complaint?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...\"</p>, <p>He nodded his head and excused himself.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I held my hand over my forehead.</p>, <p>Fuck.</p>, <p>I really didn't want to go.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was as if the air itself had cracked. Fragments, like that of a fractured mirror, lingered suspended in midair.</p>, <p>A small crowd formed outside of the shattered space. There were over several hundred students, all of them huddled together in their cliques.</p>, <p>The same couldn't be said for me.</p>, <p>Be it because they were avoiding me, or just didn't like me, nobody appeared anywhere around me.</p>, <p>.....I was the only one who was alone.</p>, <p>\"Mirror Dimension...\"</p>, <p>Not that I minded since my attention was on the cracked space in front of me.</p>, <p>'Yeah, I really don't want to go.'</p>, <p>Everything about it felt ominous.</p>, <p>Still, it wasn't like I had a choice. Whether I liked it or not, I had to go. Perhaps I'll be able to find answers here...</p>, <p>While I was in the midst of my thoughts, the instructor, Amir Wallow, showed up.</p>, <p>The surroundings went quiet.</p>, <p>\"Since everyone is gathered here, I'll make things short. We will now be diving in groups of five. I'll announce the list shortly.\"</p>, <p>The noise that had previously taken hold of the space increased as the cadets grew restless.</p>, <p>'So we're doing this in teams.'</p>, <p>\"It'll be random so the balance won't be right. However, that shouldn't matter since you aren't being graded for this. It's all about getting used to the environment for when you end up entering the more dangerous parts of the mirror dimension.\"</p>, <p>He then proceeded to give a rundown of the team's compositions. A team generally was composed of four to five members -- two damage-dealers, one long-range, one tank, and one support.</p>, <p>It generally alternated between one and two damage dealers per team.</p>, <p>In that sense, I was assigned the support role.</p>, <p>\"It is up to you to decide the team leader. Be it the strongest person, or who you feel will be able to lead better... It's up to you.\"</p>, <p>The teams were announced shortly after.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>Team Seven</p>, <p>: 1. Julien Evenus</p>, <p>: 2. Rosanne Brighton</p>, <p>: 3. Aoife Megrail</p>, <p>: 4. James Milner</p>, <p>: 5. Adan Whitelock</p>, <p>\"...Team Seven.\"</p>, <p>A lot of unfamiliar names appeared on the list. There were over a thousand first years, and it was hard for me to remember everyone's name.</p>, <p>However, there was one name that stood out from the rest.</p>, <p>Aoife Megrail.</p>, <p>The Megrail name stood out immediately. It was the name of the ruling house and one of the women that appeared in my vision.</p>, <p> Taking my eyes away from the board, I met her gaze. Her expression was hard to read, and briefly, I felt a certain coldness flash in her eyes. That went by really fast.</p>, <p>She was the first one to approach me. Her red hair gracefully swung in the air as her beautiful lips parted open.</p>, <p>\"We're on the same team.\"</p>, <p>\"...So it seems.\"</p>, <p>My tone came out rather stiff. I wasn't quite sure how to address her. With her being a princess, I had to be careful with my words.</p>, <p>That was until she spoke again.</p>, <p>\"You're weak.\"</p>, <p>She spoke in a manner that left no room for debate.</p>, <p>\"...That's why I will be the team leader.\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer and just stared at her. She looked back at me. Straight in the eyes. It was as if she was challenging me.</p>, <p>Wanted me to refuse her.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Do as you see fit.\"</p>, <p>All she did was do me a favor.</p>, <p>I didn't want to be the leader. I wasn't fit to be one as well.</p>, <p>As her composed expression began to reveal cracks under the impact of my actions, a smile tugged at my lips while I lowered my head.</p>, <p>\".....Team Leader.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>The air was dry.</p>, <p>The world appeared monochromatic, enveloped in shades of gray, with the sole exception of the vivid red and orange tones emanating from the sun in the sky.</p>, <p>I was running through a rocky field.</p>, <p>The other team members were running ahead of me. Unlike me, they didn't seem to be struggling.</p>, <p>My stamina was starting to run low.</p>, <p>Was this the difference between us...?</p>, <p>\"Let's stop here.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, we stopped just as I couldn't hold my composure. Halting, Aoife looked around before settling her gaze over a large rock.</p>, <p>\"Let's take a small break for now. We're almost near our destination.\"</p>, <p>Taking advantage of the situation, I sat on the rock to catch my breath. There were a total of five people in the group, and as I sat down, none of the members approached me and huddled over to Aoife.</p>, <p>'Can't blame them... She's a princess.'</p>, <p>Had I been in their position, I too would've been like them.</p>, <p>It was unfortunate that in the future, there was a chance she'd kill me. I needed to be careful around her.</p>, <p>An appropriate distance was required.</p>, <p>Still, from where I was, I could overhear their conversation.</p>, <p>\"Team Leader, where exactly are we going?\"</p>, <p>\"...Gathering point. We should be able to meet with the other members there.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, is that so.\"</p>, <p>A woman with gold locks sighed in relief. Rosanne Brighton. With a long staff in hand, she was the long-ranged fighter of the team.</p>, <p>An elemental user with dual attributes.</p>, <p>Fire, and water.</p>, <p>She looked around.</p>, <p>\"Things have been proceeding rather smoothly. We still haven't seen many monsters yet. Is it because this is one of the safer areas?\"</p>, <p>\"The point of this excursion is for us to familiarize ourselves with the environment. There shouldn't be that many monsters.\"</p>, <p>Standing at an imposing height of 2 meters, he towered over all of us. James Milner, the team's tanker, replied.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>Chewing on a jerky, Aoife glanced around.</p>, <p>\".....Still, keep your guard up. Always stay alert. Don't let your guard down.\"</p>, <p>\"Got it.\"</p>, <p>Nodding, Aoife finished the jerky and patted her hands.</p>, <p>\"Let's go.\"</p>, <p>We were back on the move.</p>, <p>The terrain shifted, and trees emerged in my field of vision, their leafless branches stretching out and gradually surrounding us as we advanced.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>Our group was engulfed in silence, disrupted only by the steady rhythm of our footsteps resonating against the uneven ground blanketed with a layer of damp, decomposing leaves.</p>, <p>Gradually, the light dimmed, and I sensed myself losing my sight. Wisps of fog clung to the gnarled trunks of the trees around us, making it hard for me to see.</p>, <p>\"....Continue.\"</p>, <p>A sense of dread assaulted my mind as we marched forward.</p>, <p>From eyesight to hearing... We were gradually losing sight of all our senses.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My breath started to feel heavy.</p>, <p>...Was it because I was growing tired?</p>, <p>A thought that accompanied my mind as I continued forward.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>My head throbbed all of a sudden.</p>, <p>The pain wasn't intense. It came as fast as it left. By the time I regained my senses, the light started to return.</p>, <p>'What was that...?'</p>, <p>Checking myself, I felt nothing strange with my body. Staring at my hands, I frowned but continued forward.</p>, <p>My mind eventually relaxed after a couple of minutes.</p>, <p>\"....I'm probably tired.\"</p>, <p>Just as I felt my chest grow lighter.....</p>, <p>SHIIIING--!</p>, <p>Something streaked through the air, coming at me from a nearby tree. It was so fast that I had no time to react.</p>, <p>Before I even had the chance to gather my bearings, an intense pain flooded my chest.</p>, <p>Thump.</p>, <p>And I fell to my knees.</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>Blood spilled from my mouth as I felt my head grow light.</p>, <p>The world became a blur from there.</p>, <p>\"W-what...\"</p>, <p>I could hardly speak and the words refused to leave my mouth.</p>, <p>The pain was hard to describe.</p>, <p>It was intense, and my consciousness grew faint.</p>, <p>Clank--!</p>, <p>The last thing I managed to see before I lost consciousness was a small creature diving from the front, right toward Aoife who just barely managed to react.</p>, <p>\"Sh-it...\"</p>, <p>And then the world grew dark.</p>, <p>Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"Uahp...!\"</p>, <p>As if oxygen had been removed from my lungs, I took a deep breath. My consciousness returned and clarity returned.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>The familiar sound of my footsteps echoed through the ground, and as I looked ahead, familiar backs came into view.</p>, <p>'What just...'</p>, <p>The memory of the situation was still vivid in my mind. Although my vision was hindered, the path was familiar.</p>, <p>From the trees to our current location. It was all the same. Just in a couple of minutes, we should be coming out...</p>, <p>Indeed, as I thought, lights started to return. A familiar view.</p>, <p>Gradually, my feet started to slow down.</p>, <p>Noticing my situation, the others stopped as well. With a frown, Aoife looked at me.</p>, <p>\"Are you tired?\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer her.</p>, <p>Scanning my surroundings, everything appeared to be the same as before. So much that it felt eery.</p>, <p>\"...Julien?\"</p>, <p>The positions of the trees, the placement of the rocks, and the sensation of the air--every detail rushed vividly back to my memory.</p>, <p>It can't be, right...?</p>, <p>\"Hey...!\"</p>, <p>I snapped out of it when two large hands grasped my shoulders. A rough face inched close to mine.</p>, <p>\"Someone is talking to you, pay attention.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>That was when I realized everyone was looking at me. Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath before opening my eyes again.</p>, <p>\"Let go.\"</p>, <p>\"You.\"</p>, <p>Raising my hand, I was just about to grasp his shoulder when he let go and cursed.</p>, <p>\".....Arrogant bastard.\"</p>, <p>Ignoring him, I patted and adjusted my clothes. Feeling Aoife's intense gaze, I felt compelled to say something.</p>, <p>\"There's an ambush ahead.\"</p>, <p>Maybe.</p>, <p>I wasn't too sure.</p>, <p>\"An ambush...?\"</p>, <p>Making a dumbfounded look, James's mouth dropped.</p>, <p>\"Is that really the best excuse you cou--\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>Ignoring him, I took a step forward.</p>, <p>\"Hey, you...!\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>And then another. Carefully counting each step, I closed my eyes and replayed the memory in my mind. Gradually, I arrived near the exact spot where the memory ended.</p>, <p>I was just one step away.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>My feet stopped.</p>, <p>Just one step. As long as I took a step...</p>, <p>\"Are we seriously going to waste time waiting for him? He's just trying to save himself from the embarrassment. If--\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>I took that step.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>SHIIIING--!</p>, <p>Just as in the memory, the moment I took the step, the tree rustled and something fast streaked through the air. But unlike last time, I was prepared. Tilting my body ever so slightly, it passed right before me.</p>, <p>With a 'thud,' it came crashing toward the ground, revealing a glimpse of its features.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I didn't pay much attention to it's looks. Turning my attention toward my group, I nudged with my chin.</p>, <p>\"...Get rid of it.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Foresight.</p>, <p>The gift of glimpsing into the future—a power I held. It was the third time now, and even now, I didn't fully understand it.</p>, <p>What triggered it...?</p>, <p>Was it just random, or did it follow a set pattern?</p>, <p>Questions flooded my mind.</p>, <p>But I didn't have long to ponder over them.</p>, <p>Splat—!</p>, <p>Grabbing my attention, a black substance splattered on the ground, presumingly from the monster that had just been killed.</p>, <p>I didn't care to look, though. The vision grabbed my thoughts as it replayed in my mind.</p>, <p>Every detail, from the minutiae to the grand, was etched vividly in my memory.</p>, <p>With a thought, I could recall everything that had happened. From the pain to the very last moments when something dashed at the team leader.</p>, <p>The memories were vivid in my mind, and as my gaze settled on a specific tree, my hand instinctively reached out, extending a finger to point at it.</p>, <p>\"That one.\"</p>, <p>I was sure.</p>, <p>The memories told me so.</p>, <p>\".....Get rid of that one too.\"</p>, <p>Another one was hiding in that tree.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'How did he know...?'</p>, <p>Aoife looked at his back, her eyes falling on the creature on the ground.</p>, <p>'Rabbleflit'</p>, <p>An 'infant' ranked beast. Though the lowest of all classes, it was a beast that specialized in stealth and ambushes.</p>, <p>They were both deaf and blind. They attacked based on nearby vibrations, limiting their range to a small area.</p>, <p>Even so...</p>, <p>To compensate for this evident flaw, their mastery over stealth was unparalleled.</p>, <p>Unless one possessed proficiency in search magic or had extremely keen mana senses, detecting them was nearly impossible.</p>, <p>Was Julien proficient in search magic...?</p>, <p>She didn't think so.</p>, <p>So how?</p>, <p>Mana sensitivity...?</p>, <p>\"It's hiding on that tree over there.\"</p>, <p>Aoife followed his finger.

I'm not proficient in long-range magic. If you wouldn't mind.\"</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Aoife eyed the tree in the distance and flicked her finger. The tree shriveled up, compressing like a scrunched-up paper.</p>, <p>It all happened so fast that the creature was unable to react.</p>, <p>\"Hieek...!\"</p>, <p>After a deafening screech, what followed was the creature's shriveled-up body.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Aoife took a look at the creature before turning her head away.</p>, <p>'How ugly...'</p>, <p>Just like Julien, she was talented in two fields.</p>, <p>[Mind] and [Body].</p>, <p>Unlike Julien, who was proficient in the Emotive field under the Mind classification, she was more proficient in Telekinesis.</p>, <p>With a single thought, she could manipulate an inanimate object.</p>, <p>\"Yuck, it looks nasty.\"</p>, <p>A different figure drew near, leaning forward as her golden locks cascaded over her face while she grimaced.</p>, <p>\"They really do look different than the textbooks, don't they?

Nonetheless, she nodded her head.</p>, <p>\".....Yeah.\"</p>, <p>That was when two other figures approached her. With bright smiles, they started to praise her.</p>, <p>\"You were amazing.\"</p>, <p>\"That was great. I can't believe you're so strong.\"</p>, <p>It was a situation she had grown used to. Typically, she didn't mind such flattery.</p>, <p>But strangely, they felt rather annoying at the moment.</p>, <p>'...I didn't do anything.'</p>, <p>She found it odd.</p>, <p>Since when did she mind such things?</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>At heart, she already knew the answer.</p>, <p>Swallowing her pride, much to the surprise of the others, she moved toward a certain figure. He stood alone, his gaze lingering over the nearby trees.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>She stopped when she was a few meters away from him.</p>, <p>Taking note of her appearance, he glanced at her.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>His tone was as flat and rude as ever.

The situation would've been difficult had you not warned us.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>He extended his hand to brush his shoulders.</p>, <p>\"You're right.\"</p>, <p>\"...?\"</p>, <p>Aoife found the entire situation somewhat funny. She somewhat expected such an answer from him.</p>, <p>It seemed fitting.</p>, <p>Could she be starting to get an idea of his character?</p>, <p>\"Can you continue doing it?\"</p>, <p>Aoife believed that moving forward, if they wanted no accidents to occur, they needed his assistance.</p>, <p>He had proven his abilities worked.</p>, <p>Even as the other members showed clear signs of refusal, she ignored them. For this journey to go smoothly, she needed him.</p>, <p>Pride was meaningless under such circumstances.</p>, <p>She expected him to feel the same too, but as their gazes met, he shook his head.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Casually taking out a jerky, he bit into it and turned away.</p>, <p>\"...Even if I want to, I can't.\"</p>, <p>Staring at his back, Aoife's expression didn't change.</p>, <p>Such response... It was fitting of him.</p>, <p>But as expected.</p>, <p>'I really can't stand him.'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The Mirror Dimension was an expansive space devoid of any life.</p>, <p>The amount of manpower used by the kingdom to keep the space from expanding was enormous.</p>, <p>Thankfully, just as threatening as the Mirror Dimension was, it was also a land filled with opportunities.</p>, <p>Black Region Supply-Station.</p>, <p>In front of a levitating panel adorned with a myriad of shifting images stood a gracefully poised woman with flowing black hair.</p>, <p>Delilah's gaze seemed fixed on a certain panel.</p>, <p>\".....Could it be that he's very perceptive to mana?\"</p>, <p>[Get rid of that one too.]</p>, <p>The way he was able to detect Rabbleflit so effortlessly despite not specializing in such magic. The way he was able to avoid its ambush...</p>, <p>It aroused curiosity.</p>, <p>When one thought about it, what he did wasn't all that impressive. Recognizing the mana flow of a creature was something that most mages were capable of doing after reaching a certain point.</p>, <p>The key point, however, was 'certain point'.</p>, <p>Tier 3 and above was the requirement.</p>, <p>In other words, he was able to achieve something like that before even reaching Tier 3.</p>, <p>\"Fascinating.\"</p>, <p>Truly.</p>, <p>But that was all.</p>, <p>It was just fascinating.</p>, <p>Her lingering interest in him waned when she brought her attention to a specific paper.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>It was a document detailing Julien's background.</p>, <p>The contents weren't very thick. However, a certain page caught her attention. It was a close-up image of him.</p>, <p>Her eyes slowly traced down toward his forearm, where a small black tattoo appeared.</p>, <p>It was an unremarkable tattoo. One that any other person could have.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>She was confident.</p>, <p>After doing an intensive background check, she was sure of it.</p>, <p>\"....So you've finally shown yourselves.\"</p>, <p>Delilah gently closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The paper in her hand wrinkled under her grasp.</p>, <p>\"To think you'd even try to target this place...\"</p>, <p>Finally, cracks appeared on her usually composed expression as her lips twisted up. A sneer marred her features.</p>, <p>\"How bold.\"</p>, <p>She spat out, trying her best to suppress the raging storm that was boiling in her chest.</p>, <p>Staring at the tattoo in the picture, her expression turned frosty.</p>, <p>\"How very bold...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Looks like all the teams have gathered.\"</p>, <p>There were no other hiccups on our journey to the designated spot. That was good because I still struggled to clear my mind of the vision.</p>, <p>I still felt the lingering after-effects of my death. Thankfully, it happened fast... but the very last moments were still deeply rooted in my mind.</p>, <p>\"What you guys currently experienced was merely a taste of the dimension. The deeper you venture, the harder things will become. Thankfully, our empire set up several safe stations located throughout. This one being one of them.\"</p>, <p>Amir Wallow gave a long-winded statement. He gave us a short overview of our current location.</p>, <p>Looking around, I had to hold myself from expressing my surprise.</p>, <p>High walls constructed from sturdy rock enclosed the area, while tents were scattered throughout. In the distance, a fissured space marked the entrance and exit points where people came and went.</p>, <p>It was a strange sight. One that I didn't think I would get used to easily.</p>, <p>\"This is a rather small safe-station. There's plenty deeper within the dimension, but you won't get to experience those just yet. For now, enjoy yourselves here. We will return to the institute in an hour.\"</p>, <p>The cadets all separated.</p>, <p>Perhaps because everything seemed so new, everyone looked strangely excited as they scattered to check out the safe zone.</p>, <p>I thought about checking the place, too, but...</p>, <p>\"I'm tired.\"</p>, <p>I felt strangely tired.</p>, <p>My eyelids were growing heavier, and each step felt heavier than the last. It was to the point where I had no choice but to find a place to sit.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I covered my face.</p>, <p>What sort of situation was this?</p>, <p>It wasn't as though I did much coming here. My group members did most of the killings while I watched from behind.</p>, <p>The only time I acted was when...</p>, <p>\"Could it be that?\"</p>, <p>Was this the consequence of the 'insight' ability?</p>, <p>If that was the case, I was more than happy with it. Compared to the backlash from 'immersion,' this felt like nothing.</p>, <p>\"Haha.... shit, have I become too used to this?\"</p>, <p>Physical pain, tiredness, mental trauma... It felt like I had experienced a lot of things over the past week.</p>, <p>\"This is crazy. This i—Ukh!\"</p>, <p>Pain seized my body all of a sudden.</p>, <p>It was so intense that I couldn't even shout. Spit flew from my mouth as I lost control of my body.</p>, <p>My vision blurred, and the world tilted.</p>, <p>\"...Ukh.\"</p>, <p>'Wh-what's going on...?!'</p>, <p>Clutching the side of the bench I occupied with all my strength, my legs quivered.</p>, <p>It was hard to describe the pain I was in.</p>, <p>It seemed as if it aimed to consume my mind, stimulating every corner of my consciousness before honing in on a particular point.</p>, <p>A familiar spot.</p>, <p>\"...Ah.\"</p>, <p>And as my gaze fell on the spot, I finally found my breath again.</p>, <p>I didn't know how to feel.</p>, <p>Lowering my head, I stared at my forearm, where a small tattoo appeared.</p>, <p>It was unlike how it was before.</p>, <p>Something changed.</p>, <p>\"T-his...haa... of all things...\"</p>, <p>The second leaf of the tattoo.</p>, <p>It had lit up.</p>]\n",

Focusing my attention on it, my eyes fell on the four-leaved clover.</p>, <p>Two of the leaves were currently lit.</p>, <p>The top and bottom.</p>, <p>\"...How strange.\"</p>, <p>It was a mysterious tattoo. It had been with me ever since I appeared in this world.

Four abilities?\"</p>, <p>It seemed logical.</p>, <p>I had already experienced one.</p>, <p>My mind shuddered thinking about the first ability. From what I gathered, every time I used the ability, it would take an entire day for it to recharge before I could use it again.</p>, <p>That said...</p>, <p>\"It's impossible.\"</p>, <p>While the ability replenished within a day, my mind couldn't recharge at the same pace.</p>, <p>It was a dangerous ability.</p>, <p>Every usage threatened to eat at my sanity.</p>, <p>There was a reason I was so desperate to learn my other abilities. I didn't want to completely rely on this ability.</p>, <p>Of course, that didn't mean I wasn't prepared to use it.</p>, <p>Every advantage was necessary.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'It's best if I tread lightly.'</p>, <p>Yeah.</p>, <p>So that I wouldn't lose sight of myself.</p>, <p>I had to tread lightly.</p>, <p>\"Hoo...\"</p>, <p>I floated on the water, with only my neck and hand breaking the surface.</p>, <p>Considering the after-effects of the first ability, the prospect of using the second one felt daunting.</p>, <p>My eyes continued to linger over the tattoo.</p>, <p>What was going to happen if I pressed on it...?</p>, <p>Was the side-effect going to be greater? If so, will I be fine by the end of it?</p>, <p> So many questions, and so few answers....</p>, <p>\"....Shall I try?\"</p>, <p>There was only one way to find out.</p>, <p>Although the idea seemed daunting, my mind was firm.

It was now back to how it was before.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I silently stared at my hand for what felt like forever.</p>, <p>Eventually, my head sank into the water.</p>, <p>A part of me felt relieved, but another felt disappointed.</p>, <p>Submerging myself deeper into the water, I let myself relax.</p>, <p>In this strange silence.</p>, <p>I felt at peace.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The next day.</p>, <p>Classes were running as usual. First years weren't allowed to select their own courses. Therefore, as I glanced at the name of the lecture, I had to resist the urge to audibly groan.</p>, <p>\".....Language study.\"</p>, <p>As expected.</p>, <p>Even in this world, these types of lectures were unavoidable.</p>, <p>The language that was used in this empire was called 'Lumoraic'. A modern language that was only a few centuries old.</p>, <p>It was good that when I came to this world I was already able to speak, or else...</p>, <p>\"Let's not think about it.\"</p>, <p>I silently entered the classroom.</p>, <p>The classroom was rather large. With over a hundred students, it had to be spacious.</p>, <p>The moment I entered the classroom, several gazes fell on me. Their gazes still felt burdensome, but I was slowly starting to get used to them.</p>, <p>I looked around before eventually making my way toward where Leon was.</p>, <p>It was strange.</p>, <p>Before, he'd used to follow me everywhere. As if he was studying my every move.</p>, <p>However, now... He didn't seem to care as much.</p>, <p>Still, he did save me a seat.</p>, <p>So that's that.</p>, <p>I had just taken a seat when Leon glanced at me and frowned.</p>, <p>\".....You look quite tired.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yeah.\"</p>, <p>I hardly slept last night.</p>, <p>\"I'm still adjusting.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh. Take care of yourself.\"</p>, <p>\"...Yeah.\"</p>, <p>The conversation ended there. He was a man of little words, and so was I. Our conversations usually lasted for this long.</p>, <p>To an outsider, they probably sounded like an extremely stiff conversation. However, I liked it to be like this.</p>, <p>It was the perfect distance.</p>, <p>Not too close and not too far.</p>, <p>It was exactly 8 o'clock when the professor in charge came in.</p>, <p>\"Looks like the class is packed. It's nice to see so many students eager to learn a new language.\"</p>, <p>The professor was a middle-aged man adorned with a meticulously groomed mustache and gray hair. Clad in elegant attire, his demeanor exuded an unmistakable aura of grace.</p>, <p>It was obvious at a glance that he was a high-end noble.</p>, <p>\"As many of you know, the mirror dimensions hold many mysteries. From resources to ancient scripts... There are a lot of hidden treasures within the dimension.\"</p>, <p>There was a reason why the Empire had many supply stations constructed within the Dimension.</p>, <p>It wasn't just for the sake of stopping the expansion of the dimension. It was also for the sake of gathering resources. From the ruins of old civilizations to ores, and monsters... It held a lot of opportunity.</p>, <p>\"As one says. Knowledge is power. Within the ancient civilizations, there are many books detailing a lot of useful information regarding the expansion of the Mirror Dimension. By studying their language, we're empowering ourselves with the ability to understand their mistakes and technology.\"</p>, <p>The professor seemed enthusiastic about the lecture.</p>, <p>He went on to brag about the Empire's achievement in this field and how they were ahead of the other Empires.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I couldn't feel the same excitement he felt.</p>, <p>\"....Huam.\"</p>, <p>A light yawn escaped my mouth.</p>, <p>It was a quiet one.</p>, <p>To the extent that no one else seemed to notice.</p>, <p>But it perfectly reflected my state of mind.</p>, <p>I was tired, and the lecture was boring.</p>, <p>Having barely slept the previous night, coupled with how interesting the lecture was, I found myself succumbing to drowsiness.</p>, <p>I had to pinch myself several times to keep myself from falling asleep.</p>, <p>But there was a slight problem.</p>, <p>While I did try my best to hide my drowsiness, it wasn't enough.</p>, <p>--Cadet Julien, is my lecture boring you?</p>, <p>A shadow cast over the area I was in.</p>, <p>Looking up, the professor was standing a few meters away from me.</p>, <p>\"...?\"</p>, <p>I scratched the side of my head.</p>, <p>--Did you manage to sleep last night?</p>, <p>I thought about an appropriate answer but,</p>, <p>--No.</p>, <p>I shook my head and came clean.</p>, <p>--I wasn't able to sleep much last night.</p>, <p>The professor's expression stiffened all of a sudden.</p>, <p>A small commotion followed suit as multiple eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>The situation took me aback.</p>, <p>'What's going on...?'</p>, <p>And then, I heard a small voice behind me.</p>, <p>\".....Was it just me or did his pronunciation sound even better than the professor's?\"</p>, <p>Pronunciation...?</p>, <p>I thought back on the conversation I had with the professor.</p>, <p>All he did was ask whether his lecture was boring me.</p>, <p>What was so strange ab-</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>That's when I realized.</p>, <p>'This...'</p>, <p>We were both speaking English.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The language class ended after one hour.</p>, <p>Evelyn walked with her head lowered, accompanied by a young woman with short brown hair.</p>, <p>\"Ah~ My back hurts. I can't believe we had to go through that.\"</p>, <p>Theoretical classes always tended to be more boring than practical ones.</p>, <p>\"And the fact that we have to memorize the alphabet before the next class is even worse. Kill me already...!\"</p>, <p>As Josephine grumbled, she suddenly recalled something and tilted her head.</p>, <p>\"Evelyn, didn't you say you were acquainted with Julien?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts at the mention of Julien's name.</p>, <p>\"Did you say something?\"</p>, <p>\"Geez~ Pay attention when I'm talking.\"</p>, <p>Rubbing her forehead, Josephin repeated,</p>, <p>\"Didn't you say you were acquainted with Julien?\"</p>, <p>\"...Ah, yes.\"</p>, <p>Julien. An image of a man appeared in her mind.</p>, <p>It stuck there and refused to leave.</p>, <p>\"Was he always like that? I mean, not only is he the Black Star, but he also seems to be very proficient in English. Shee~\"</p>, <p>Josephine rubbed the sides of her arms.</p>, <p>\"Did you notice the professor's expression when he was talking to him? For a moment, I found myself questioning who the real expert was. Did you not feel the same way?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Evelyn remained silent at the question. She had been quietly biting her lips for a while now.</p>, <p>Josephine tilted her head in confusion.</p>, <p>Why is she so quiet?</p>, <p>She usually wasn't this quiet.</p>, <p>\"What's wrong? Did you not feel the same?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>But yet again Evelyn remained quiet.</p>, <p>Realizing that something was off, Josephine followed Evelyn's line of sight.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>That was when she saw a figure in the distance.</p>, <p>He stood erect, his presence distinct from the others, and his strides measured and steady. His presence alone gathered the stares of those around him.</p>, <p>Staring at him from the distance, Evelyn's eyes narrowed.</p>, <p>Julien. What happened in the five years she hadn't seen him?</p>, <p>Gradually, the distance between the two of them shrank.</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>With one more step, he appeared in front of her.</p>, <p>As he passed, their gazes met briefly.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She thought he'd continue forward, but...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>His feet came to a stop just as he passed. Evelyn felt her shoulders grow tense at the fact. Turning around to face him, her eyes met with his.</p>, <p>They were cold.</p>, <p>Detached of any feelings. If before she could feel the emotions in his gaze, now... all she could feel was emptiness.</p>, <p>Alienation.</p>, <p>His words soon broke her thoughts.</p>, <p>\"Your lips.\"</p>, <p>He pointed.</p>, <p>\".....They're bleeding.\"</p>]\n",

It closely reminded me of the pain that had taken over my life during the later stages of it.</p>, <p>Perhaps that was why...</p>, <p>Without realizing it, I blurted out loud,</p>, <p>\"It smells like shit.\"</p>, <p>At that, she furrowed her brows.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>She took a long drag of the cigarette before blowing the smoke in my direction.</p>, <p>\"Tough luck.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stood blankly.</p>, <p>As the smoke drifted past me, unwanted memories clouded my mind once again.</p>, <p>To the point where I unconsciously moved forward.</p>, <p>\"Oy.\"</p>, <p>Flicking the cigarette away, she clicked her tongue and stood more alert.</p>, <p>\"...What the hell are you doing?\"</p>, <p>Tik—</p>, <p>The cigarette fell right in front of me, and my feet paused.</p>, <p>As if bewitched, I focused my attention on the lingering orange glow at the tip as smoke drifted through the air.</p>, <p>My hand unknowingly trembled.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Stomp...</p>, <p>I raised my foot and stomped on it.</p>, <p>The weight on my chest lightened, and I felt like I could breathe again.</p>, <p>It was an impulsive action.</p>, <p>One that I normally wouldn't have taken.</p>, <p>But,</p>, <p>\"Was that so hard to do?\"</p>, <p>The side effects of the spell were still lingering in my mind, and the cigarette served to trigger painful memories I tried to hold deep within my mind.</p>, <p>It was something that I had trouble controlling.</p>, <p>\"Ah, shit.\"</p>, <p>Ruffling her hair, her face crumbled.</p>, <p>\"I didn't take you for such a fucker. Just like that bitch, you are the fucking same.\"</p>, <p>That bitch?</p>, <p>I never had the chance to figure out who she was referring to.</p>, <p>By the time I focused my attention back on her, she was already gone.</p>, <p>That was perhaps for the best.</p>, <p>I wasn't in the right state of mind at the moment.</p>, <p>Especially since,</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 2.

So did my pulse.</p>, <p>\"Kh..!\"</p>, <p>My jaw was clenched so tightly that it started to hurt.</p>, <p>Even so, I kept myself rooted in my seat. Even as the world turned red and my vision narrowed.</p>, <p>I kept myself rooted in my seat.</p>, <p>My hands shook.</p>, <p>But my thoughts remained clear.</p>, <p>\"C-control.\"</p>, <p>I forced those words through my clenched teeth.</p>, <p>R-right.</p>, <p>...I needed to control myself.</p>, <p>I couldn't let myself be controlled by my emotions again.</p>, <p>\"Never.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Haven had 'Extra-curricular Activities'.</p>, <p>In simpler terms: clubs. With the world being grim and the student reality harsh, clubs were set up as a way to ease the mental burden on students.</p>, <p>\"Swimming... Football... Exercise Club... Cooking...\"</p>, <p>There were a lot of clubs to choose from. From physical ones to nonphysical ones. The choices seemed endless.</p>, <p>\"Comedy club...?\"</p>, <p>My eyes lingered on 'Comedy Club' for a few seconds too long. Enough to warrant Leon's attention as he turned to glance my way.</p>, <p>In order to remain consistent with the previous Julien, I had him help me select a course. It was a necessary step I needed to take to ensure my safety.</p>, <p>\"Are you considering it? To understand emotions better?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, yeah...\"</p>, <p>That was part of the reason, sure. But there was another reason why the club interested me. I kept thinking back at the joke I said a week ago. The Cheetah, one.</p>, <p>It had bugged me for quite a while now.</p>, <p>But was the joke bad?</p>, <p>'....I don't think it was that bad.'</p>, <p>Or maybe there was a problem elsewhere? The delivery?</p>, <p>But thinking about it, the ones I did tell the joke to always had stiff expressions. That girl and Leon...</p>, <p>Tough crowd I guess.</p>, <p>\"That would make sense, but Julien wouldn't go for something like that. You need to keep in mind that--\"</p>, <p>\"I think it was my delivery.\"</p>, <p>Yeah, it had to be that.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Leon's body stiffened on the spot.</p>, <p>'Ah, shit.'</p>, <p>I raised my head to look at him. He looked at me with widened eyes and an expression that seemed to say 'Has he lost it...?'</p>, <p>I felt a little offended by his gaze.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>Why was he looking at me like that...?</p>, <p>He opened his mouth but closed it shortly after. He then turned around to face the opposite direction.</p>, <p>\"What are you--\"</p>, <p>\"Kht.\"</p>, <p>Kht...?</p>, <p>I stopped whatever I was doing and leaned my head to get a better look at him.</p>, <p>Why is he...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>An idea suddenly struck my mind.</p>, <p>I took a good long minute to think before finally saying,</p>, <p>\"What do you call a fish with no eyes?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Leon's eyes widened. For a moment, I thought I saw 'fear' flash in his eyes as his body flinched.</p>, <p>I continued,</p>, <p>\"Fsh.\"</p>, <p>\"Uhk...!\"</p>, <p>His body flinched.</p>, <p>And I continued,</p>, <p>\"What did the farmer who lost his rake say?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"Where is my rake?\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>Without looking back, Leon moved forward. The entire time, his shoulders were trembling. Staring at him, I felt the need to continue and raised my voice.</p>, <p>\"What do you call a fly with no wings?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"A walk.\"</p>, <p>\"....Kehut!\"</p>, <p>Holding his mouth, Leon sprinted forward.</p>, <p>I chased after him.</p>, <p>\"What did the cow...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Krrr...</p>, <p>The form expanded, gradually unveiling its massive, decaying jaws and spiky back. A potent surge of mana swept the surroundings as the figure increased in size.</p>, <p>\"Keep it quiet. We're not too far off from the institute.\"</p>, <p>Delilah stood not far from the creature. Her gaze lingered over the creature who stared at her with deep apprehension.</p>, <p>It growled at her before speaking.</p>, <p>\"...You think you can stop us? Your struggles are futile. Our preparations are almost done.\"</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>Delilah's expression changed. With a laugh, she looked at the creature mockingly.</p>, <p>\"You bastards are always the same. How many of your 'attacks' and 'preparations' have we thwarted over the years? Have you yet to learn your lesson?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>The beast growled.</p>, <p>\"You don--\"</p>, <p>Delilah's voice, layered by two other similar ones, cut through the creature.</p>, <p>\"You can't hide it from me.\"</p>, <p>The creature shuddered.</p>, <p>\"Hide...?\"</p>, <p>\"Your fear. I can see it from miles away.\"</p>, <p>Crunch...</p>, <p>The beast unknowingly took a step back as its body shuddered. An unknown emotion welled up from deep within its body, threatening to consume him.</p>, <p>\"Y-you....!\"</p>, <p>A red glow enveloped the beast's eyes. It understood then that its emotions were being played with.</p>, <p>But it was already too late.</p>, <p>In the moment the beast stepped back, its defeat was already set in stone.</p>, <p>Delilah's expression returned to its usually indifferent one as she raised her hand.</p>, <p>\"Krrrrr--!\"</p>, <p>The beast screamed, but it was futile.</p>, <p>Within moments of her raising her hand, the space around the beast compressed, and the echoing sound of bones cracking filled the air.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>Just like that, a 'Terror' ranked beast had died.</p>, <p>Udududuk--!</p>, <p>But something strange happened the moment the beast died. Black foam escaped its lips and its figure shrank to reveal the silhouette of a figure.</p>, <p>...A human.</p>, <p>Crunch... Crunch...</p>, <p>Delilah halted a few meters away from the body, her eyes coldly tracing it. Eventually, she bent down and turned its arm over.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A four-leaved clover appeared in her vision.</p>, <p>\"....As expected.\"</p>, <p>She let go of the arm, and ambers floated in the sky as the body gradually disappeared from view.</p>, <p>Crackle...!</p>, <p>Her cold eyes remained fixed on the disappearing body.</p>, <p>Gradually, her mouth parted open to mutter,</p>, <p>\"Inverted Sky.\"</p>, <p>A figure appeared in her mind.</p>, <p>One that she wholeheartedly preached to be the Black Star.</p>, <p>A crack yet again formed on her expressionless face.</p>, <p>\"....I hope I'm wrong.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was Friday.</p>, <p>The last day of the week.</p>, <p>Just like that, the first week at the institute was almost over. Today marked the second week of my transmigration.</p>, <p>Time seemed to have flown by during those two weeks. I could still vividly recall everything that had happened on the first day as if it were yesterday.</p>, <p>Quite frankly, I was tired.</p>, <p>Both physically and mentally.</p>, <p>But... I was slowly starting to adjust to this world. Slowly but surely, I was getting there.</p>, <p>I just needed a little bit more time.</p>, <p>\"Here you go.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I glanced at the letter that sat on my desk, and I looked up. It was the last lesson of the day, and I was just about to pack up when he suddenly showed up out of nowhere.</p>, <p>\"....What is this?\"</p>, <p>\"An invitation.\"</p>, <p>Leon answered flatly. I thought about having him elaborate but chose otherwise and just opened the letter.</p>, <p>I was bound to find out anyway.</p>, <p>To : Julien of the Evenus Barony.</p>, <p>We extend our warmest greetings to your esteemed self and cordially invite you to join our exchange.</p>, <p>Your presence is certain to elevate the grandeur of the occasion, and we eagerly anticipate the pleasure of your company alongside fellow dignitaries and distinguished guests. The event promises an evening of refined conversation, exquisite cuisine, and cultural enrichment.\"</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>I skimmed through the contents of the letter.</p>, <p>\"So, in short... A party?\"</p>, <p>\"Sort of.\"</p>, <p>Sort of...?</p>, <p>\"...And I have to attend?\"</p>, <p>I rubbed my forehead.</p>, <p>I was already starting to feel a headache.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded and added,</p>, <p>\"Everyone does.\"</p>, <p>\"...Ah.\"</p>, <p>Fuck.</p>, <p>Leon looked around before lowering his tone.</p>, <p> \"It's best if you attend the ceremony. Create some connections. It will help you out in the long term.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Remaining quiet, I sorted through my thoughts.</p>, <p>Indeed, he had a point. Connections were certainly important in this society. Not only to establish myself better as 'Julien', but for the future when the time came for me to leave this place.</p>, <p>It would certainly make my life easier.</p>, <p>With such thoughts, I looked up at Leon and slid the letter over.</p>, <p>\".....Fine.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The Haven campus was large.</p>, <p>Spanning over a large land, it boasted seven main halls—Leoni Hall, Rondeo Hall, Dorset Hall, Birming Hall, Milnton Hall, Karlson Hall, and Rottingham Hall.</p>, <p>Each Hall had its own distinct function.</p>, <p>The Rondeo Hall was where the dorms were located. The Leoni Hall was where the auditorium was located, the Rottingham was where the professors were situated, and so on…</p>, <p>Each hall served a distinct function, simplifying navigation for newcomers to the academy.</p>, <p>Rottingham Hall.</p>, <p>Tak— Tak!</p>, <p>The hall echoed with the soft click of her heels.</p>, <p>Delilah walked forward without as much as a single change in her expression.</p>, <p>\"Good afternoon, Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>\"It's nice to see you Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>Along the way, she'd get greeted by the staff that passed her. Glancing at them, she'd return them a nod.</p>, <p>This proceeded until she arrived at her office.</p>, <p>Creaaaak...</p>, <p>As the door opened, her feet came to a pause.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Her brows twitched at the sight that greeted her. Scratching the side of her head, she nimbly walked past the rows of documents that were scattered all over the floor before reaching her desk, where she sat down.</p>, <p>Gradually, her gaze fell on several fresh documents that sat by her desk.</p>, <p>They said;</p>, <p>[Extra-curricular Activities First Year Cadet selection]</p>, <p>'Oh, there was that.'</p>, <p>It was her job to review their applications.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>Casually flipping through the pages, she stamped on several of the applicant's submissions.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak—</p>, <p>Her stamp raised and fell continuously.</p>, <p>Until...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>her eyes fell on a certain application. It was none other than Julien's.</p>, <p>\"Comedy club...?\"</p>, <p>It was a fitting choice after a little bit of thought.</p>, <p>It probably had to do with his powers.</p>, <p>The stamp hovered over the application when...</p>, <p>\"Maybe not.\"</p>, <p>She stopped herself.</p>, <p>Though her assumptions about him had yet to be proven, she still didn't feel reassured to leave him to his own devices.</p>, <p>Therefore.....</p>, <p>\"Hold.\"</p>, <p>She put the application on hold.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Tak. Tak—</p>, <p>For the next half hour, she sorted through the documents in front of her.</p>, <p>By the time she was done, her head throbbed. Reaching out for her drawer, wrappers scattered on the ground when she opened it. Not minding it, she inserted her hand in and dug through the mess before finally finding what she wanted—A chocolate bar.</p>, <p>The most peculiar part of the bar was the sticker that stuck on top of it.</p>, <p>It said, 'Property of Delilah'.</p>, <p>Yeah, because this was her bar.</p>, <p>She bit into the bar.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Only then did her expression relax, and so did her shoulders.</p>, <p>Finally, she redirected her attention to her desk, where a crystal device sat. It was glowing faintly. Shoving the chocolate into her mouth, she tapped on it.</p>, <p>A voice echoed across the room shortly after.</p>, <p>[...Delilah]</p>, <p>It was deep and filled with authority.</p>, <p>Tossing the wrapper, Delilah replied flatly,</p>, <p>\"I took care of the problem.\"</p>, <p>[What was it this time?]</p>, <p>\"Still manageable... Nothing much yet. A Terror Rank.\"</p>, <p>[.....Terror Rank?]</p>, <p>A certain gravity seized the room after Delilah's words.</p>, <p>A specific classification existed for those originating from the Mirror Dimension.</p>, <p>It was one that the four Empires came to a consensus with.</p>, <p>The ranks were as follows: Infant Rank, Junior Rank, Terror Rank, Destroyer Rank, and Primordial Rank.</p>, <p>The fact that a 'Terror Rank' beast had shown up near the premises of the Institute served as a deep reminder of how grave the situation was.</p>, <p>[It seems like they're becoming bolder and bolder. When was the last time they sent someone this powerful?]</p>, <p>\"Maybe a couple of years ago? I'm not sure.\"</p>, <p>As she spoke, Delilah's hand reached out for her drawer again, and she took out yet another chocolate bar.</p>, <p>\"...But it wasn't anything worth paying attention to.\"</p>, <p>A Terror Rank was a monster that had the equivalent power of a High Wizard.</p>, <p>Her trivialization of its power showed just how powerful she was.</p>, <p>[Were there any other problems...?]</p>, <p>Delilah pondered before carefully saying,</p>, <p>\"...It seems like they're planning something, but I'm not quite sure what. I've already raised the security of the institute, so we shouldn't have any problems, but you might never know.\"</p>, <p>[Yes... Make sure to keep alert. We've already stopped many attempts over the years, but you might never know when they will make a breakthrough.]</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>The call seemed to end on that note, and just as Delilah planned to end it, she heard his voice again,</p>, <p>[.....Oh, there should be a gathering tonight. Are you going to be attending?]</p>, <p>\"Gathering?\"</p>, <p>[Did you forget?]</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>[So you did...]</p>, <p>\"I didn't.\"</p>, <p>For some reason, Delilah felt the need to deny it.</p>, <p>Her pride wasn't allowing her to admit that she had forgotten.</p>, <p>Because...</p>, <p>She really had forgotten.</p>, <p>[Oh, that's good. I'll be seeing you there, then. I'll be going now, and... clean your mouth.]</p>, <p>\"....Uh?\"</p>, <p>The call ended on that note.</p>, <p>Stunned, Delilah reached for her lips, where traces of the chocolate remained.</p>, <p>Her brows slowly knit together.</p>, <p>\"How did he know...?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was late into the night when I reached the destination.</p>, <p>Since it wasn't far, we walked along the campus road to get to the place.</p>, <p>The venue sat at the Academy's outskirts amidst a cluster of villas. The chosen gathering spot distinguished itself effortlessly.</p>, <p>Towering over its neighbors, this particular villa not only boasted impressive size but also flaunted intricate decorations. Bright lights strategically placed accentuated this further, setting it apart from the others.</p>, <p>\"We're here.\"</p>, <p>Having rehearsed the situation beforehand, Leon went ahead of me and handed over our letters to the butler in charge.</p>, <p>He was a young man with black hair, perhaps about my age.</p>, <p>\"It's a pleasure to meet you, Black Star.\"</p>, <p>The butler greeted me after a quick look at the invitation.</p>, <p>His welcoming smile felt rather burdensome as he extended his hand toward the door of the villa, where he proceeded to open it.</p>, <p>[The son of the third head of the Evenus Barony. A first-year cadet and the Black Star. Julien Dacre Evenus.]</p>, <p>Having already been briefed beforehand by Leon, I wasn't startled by the sudden announcement.</p>, <p>I was, however, struggling to keep my face composed.</p>, <p>'I know this is something nobles do... But does it really need to be this exaggerated?'</p>, <p>There was also the issue regarding all the attendees who were now directing their attention toward me.</p>, <p>\"Please have a pleasant night.\"</p>, <p>The butler added. As if he was trying to add salt to my wounds.</p>, <p>\"Huuuu...\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I proceeded forward toward the hall.</p>, <p>I once again reminded myself of my identity.</p>, <p>'I'm Julien Dacre Evenus.'</p>, <p>'The Black Star and the number one ranked cadet in the first years.'</p>, <p>'When people look at me, they are the ones who grow nervous.'</p>, <p>'Not me.'</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, I headed deeper into the venue.</p>, <p>There were a lot of familiar faces as I moved forward. From members of my class to some of the staff and professors I had met over the past week. There were also many unfamiliar faces. Some old and some young.</p>, <p>But there was one person that stood out the most out of all of them.</p>, <p>She seemed to be the center of attention.</p>, <p>The one where the focus gravitated toward.</p>, <p>Aoife K. Megrail.</p>, <p>The Empire's one and only princess.</p>, <p>In a one-piece red dress that accentuated her striking red hair, she stood out, her beauty eclipsing many of those present.</p>, <p>Graceful movements and an elegant demeanor added to her image as she eloquently conversed with those engaging her in conversation.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Just as I noticed her, she noticed me. I thought nothing of it and prepared to look away when, all of a sudden, she smiled.</p>, <p>Smiled...?</p>, <p>I was momentarily taken aback.</p>, <p>So did the many that were looking at her.</p>, <p>By the time I regained my senses, she was standing in front of me. I felt the attention of all those present in the room.</p>, <p>...And just as I looked down to wonder what was happening, her glossy lips parted open, and her crisp voice gently reached my ears.</p>, <p>\"I've been waiting for you.\"</p>, <p>She extended her hand.</p>, <p>\".....Would you give me the honor?\"</p>, <p>The fuc—</p>]\n",

The lights shone brightest her way, with everyone seeking ways to approach her.</p>, <p>Gatherings were burdensome to her.</p>, <p>It wasn't that she didn't understand their importance... she did, but... they weren't something she looked forward to. The weight of her role weighed heavily on her shoulders.</p>, <p>\"I'll do that.\"</p>, <p>Aoife lightly massaged her cheeks.</p>, <p>They had grown stiff from the prolonged smiling.</p>, <p>It was proper decorum for her to greet everyone with a smile. Outwardly, she had to maintain perfection; there could be no flaws in her appearance.</p>, <p>Like a thornless rose.</p>, <p>\"...I'll most certainly find the time later to discuss the matters with you.\"</p>, <p>\"Haha~ Is that so? Thank you so much.\"</p>, <p>The man she was talking to was quite handsome in appearance. With short brown hair and deep green eyes, he stood out from the rest.</p>, <p>Although he wasn't from a notable household, his magic was strong. He would certainly make for a good connection.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'The smell.'</p>, <p>Aoife felt her nose scrunch up with each breath.</p>, <p>His entire body was clouded with a thick plume of perfume. A very powerful one at that. The smell was so overbearing that Aoife had a hard time keeping her face straight.</p>, <p>\"....But is it possible to talk about it now?\"</p>, <p>Lines were slowly being crossed.</p>, <p>\"Unfortunately, I am busy.\"</p>, <p>Aoife shook her head and made her rejection clear.</p>, <p>\"Haha, it won't take long. Please hear me out.\"</p>, <p>\"I'm sorry.\"</p>, <p>He insisted.</p>, <p>\"It really won't take that much time. I insis—\"</p>, <p>[The son of the third head of the Evenus Barony. A first-year cadet and the Black Star. Julien Dacre Evenus.]</p>, <p>A certain name resounded across the hall and the noise inside the venue quieted down.</p>, <p>Heads turned, and the doors swung open.</p>, <p>Wearing a black outfit clothing that perfectly accentuated his appearance, his entrance captured the attention of everyone in the room.</p>, <p>With chiseled features and calm and steady strides, he exuded an air of nobility. His dark, wavy hair framed his perfect features.</p>, <p>The noble's piercing gaze carried a magnetic allure, leaving an indelible impression on those who settled their gazes on him.</p>, <p>\"He's here.\"</p>, <p>\"Isn't that...\"</p>, <p> \"That's him, right?\"</p>, <p>Whispers spread across the hall as people talked about him.</p>, <p>'He's here...'</p>, <p>Aoife's expression remained unchanged as he entered.</p>, <p>As expected, only his presence could garner the attention of all present. However, unlike her, nobody approached him.</p>, <p>He too was a rose.</p>, <p>But unlike her, he was filled with thorns. One that kept those away from him. He could only be admired, but not touched.</p>, <p>A trait that made Aoife envious of him.</p>, <p>But she wasn't like the rest.</p>, <p>Tak!</p>, <p>Her heels clicked on the marble floor as she advanced. All eyes were on her as she moved forward.</p>, <p>The distance between the two shrank.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>And she was soon standing in front of him.</p>, <p>There wasn't much of a change in his expression. He simply stared at her. His gaze felt pressuring, almost intimidating.</p>, <p>'As expected of a rose filled with thorns.'</p>, <p>Just standing next to him felt daunting.</p>, <p>That said...</p>, <p>\"I've been waiting for you.\"</p>, <p>Aoife's lips pulled up and she extended her hand.</p>, <p>\".....Would you give me the honor?\"</p>, <p>Mere thorns weren't anything Aoife was worried about.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Should I take the hand...?</p>, <p>I looked at the outstretched hand. Feeling the gazes of all those around me, I lifted my gaze to look at Aoife.</p>, <p>'What is she thinking?'</p>, <p>I struggled to understand the motive of her actions.</p>, <p>Was there some sort of secret agenda, or was this some sort of whim? I doubted it to be the latter.</p>, <p>'....How troublesome.'</p>, <p>It wasn't as if I could refuse her in front of so many people.</p>, <p>Furthermore, even though I didn't want to have anything to do with her due to the vision, I knew not to antagonize her.</p>, <p>Perhaps the reason she killed me in the vision was because of the way I behaved.</p>, <p>That wouldn't do me any good.</p>, <p>Distance was good, but not at the cost of them hating me in the process.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>\"...It would be my pleasure.\"</p>, <p>I accepted her offer and took her hand. Her expression subtly changed to one of surprise, but she was quick to hide it. With a thin smile, she lowered her head.</p>, <p>\"It's settled, then.\"</p>, <p>The two of us walked toward a more secluded area. Though there were still eyes on us, they were significantly less than before.</p>, <p>None of them seemed keen on approaching us.</p>, <p>I glanced at her as she walked alongside me. Apparently understanding my gaze, she pursed her lips to reply,</p>, <p>\"I needed a little break.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh \"</p>, <p>I figured that much.</p>, <p>But was that all to it?</p>, <p>\"That's all.\"</p>, <p>Her words seemed to clarify that point.</p>, <p>But I didn't trust her.</p>, <p>\"...It must be tough being a princess.\"</p>, <p>\"Would've been tougher if I was the Black Star.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Was it just me, or did she sound salty?</p>, <p>I raised my brow to look at her.</p>, <p>She frowned,</p>, <p>\"I'm not.\"</p>, <p>\"....I didn't say anything.\"</p>, <p>\"Your face says it all.\"</p>, <p>Did it?</p>, <p>I grabbed a nearby cup and slowly savored the drink. But, just as I took a sip of the drink, I felt my brows crease and my tongue shrivel up.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"That's grape juice.\"</p>, <p>\"....I figured.\"</p>, <p>I put the drink down.</p>, <p>Did I hate grape juice...? No, not really. I didn't mind it. However, there was something about the drink that my body rejected.</p>, <p>\"Sweet.\"</p>, <p>It was sweet.</p>, <p>Way too sweet for my tastes.</p>, <p>\"Sweet?\"</p>, <p>When Aoife tried the drink, her eyebrow rose. She looked at me with a gaze that seemed to say, 'What are you talking about?'</p>, <p>I tilted my head.</p>, <p>Does she not feel the same?</p>, <p>\"It's too much.\"</p>, <p>\"....Uh. You are weird.\"</p>, <p>Me?</p>, <p>\"Try this.\"</p>, <p>She proceeded to hand me a small pastry.</p>, <p>I looked at her weirdly.</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>\"Try.\"</p>, <p>She insisted. I thought about rejecting her, but seeing how insistent she was being, I decided to go along with it and took a small bite.</p>, <p>It wouldn't hurt anyway.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The moment I took a bite of the pastry, my lips pursed together and I momentarily forgot how to swallow.</p>, <p>Regardless of how hard I tried, it just wouldn't go down.</p>, <p>What the...</p>, <p>\".....As expected.\"</p>, <p>Aoife's lips pulled up in realization.</p>, <p>\"You can't take sweets.\"</p>, <p>I grabbed the nearest tissue and spat out the pastry. When I glanced at Aoife, I noticed a subtle shift in her expression.</p>, <p>It was as if she found something amusing.</p>, <p>\"....I guess you aren't as perfect as you make yourself out to be.\"</p>, <p>What does that even mean...</p>, <p>And, why does she look so satisfied?</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>My mouth had just parted open to say something when I realized that she was already gone. 'When did she...' As I glanced around, I found my eyes tracing her back.</p>, <p>For some reason, staring at her back, her steps seemed lighter than usual.</p>, <p>'Crazy.'</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>A sudden tug of my clothes attracted my attention.</p>, <p>I looked around but was left confused.</p>, <p>Nothing.</p>, <p>\"Wh-ah.\"</p>, <p>I lowered my gaze and met two eyes.</p>, <p>Stare—</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>They stared at me with incredible intensity.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"A child?\"</p>, <p>They belonged to a child. A little girl with long black hair, and large crystal eyes. Her appearance was extremely cute.</p>, <p>'....What is a child doing here?'</p>, <p>Cuteness aside, I was confused.</p>, <p>What was she doing here? Wasn't this supposed to be a gathering of important people?</p>, <p>Perhaps a child of a professor?</p>, <p>Stare—</p>, <p>Her stare turned even more intense. It was as if lasers were shooting at me.</p>, <p>\"What...?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>The child didn't reply and merely shifted her gaze.</p>, <p>Following her line of sight, I realized.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I held up my hand. The one that was holding the pastry.</p>, <p>\"You want this?\"</p>, <p>Nod. Nod.</p>, <p>Her head bobbed up and down as saliva drooped from the corner of her mouth. She was quick to wipe her lips.</p>, <p>The sight was an amusing one.</p>, <p>\"Here.\"</p>, <p>I handed her the pastry which she quickly took and shoved down her mouth.</p>, <p>The sight left me momentarily stunned.</p>, <p>What sort of situation was this...?</p>, <p>That said, staring at her, my lips gently moved up.</p>, <p>\"Clean up your mouth first.\"</p>, <p>Taking a tissue, I dabbed her mouth.</p>, <p>\"Here too.\"</p>, <p>There were crumbs all over.</p>, <p>\"Just how are you eating...?\"</p>, <p>She reminded me of my brother a lot.</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>I stopped when I realized what I was doing.</p>, <p>She reminded me of him so much that I had acted out of impulse.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, she didn't seem to have minded as she continued to eat the pastries in peace. I sighed in relief and leaned back on the table.</p>, <p>I didn't know how to feel.</p>, <p>I was once again reminded of the fact that my brother was no longer next to me.</p>, <p>That there was a chance I could never see him again.</p>, <p>A little part of me told me to move on and give up. To forget about my old life and move on.</p>, <p>Such thoughts haunted me every day.</p>, <p>But... I couldn't. I just couldn't. Throwing away my past meant rejecting the very existence of my brother... I couldn't do it.</p>, <p>Even if it meant I was chasing the impossible, I didn't plan on giving up.</p>, <p>I lowered my head to stare at my hands.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>'Why can't I progress?'</p>, <p>Even though two weeks had gone by, and I had been practicing every day... I couldn't grasp my other magic.</p>, <p>It was as if it rejected me.</p>, <p>Regardless of my struggles, I wasn't able to make any progress.</p>, <p>It was frustrating.</p>, <p>\"Haaaa...\"</p>, <p>I knew that I had to be patient.</p>, <p>That I would one day get there. But... How long did I have to wait for that day to come? My days were running low, and the gravity of my situation was starting to sink in.</p>, <p>I didn't have long.</p>, <p>That much was true.</p>]\n",

I wasn't quite sure.</p>, <p>\"Uhh...\"</p>, <p>In the time that I spent here fruitlessly trying to make connections, I could've spent training and learning my second ability.</p>, <p>With such thoughts, I took a sip of water and headed for the exit.</p>, <p>There was no longer a point in staying here.</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Because I didn't fit here.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"What do you think about joining our household? I'm sure we can offer you better incentives than the ones offered by the Evenus household.\"</p>, <p>\"Firstly, we'd be willing to pay you more than they pay you. Not only that, but we'd also relieve you of your knightly duties and support you wholeheartedly.\"</p>, <p>\"If you wish to remain a knight, we may even promote you to commander. With a word, I can make that happen.\"</p>, <p>Leon casually took a sip of his drink, something called 'Amorena' and pursed his lips.</p>, <p>'.....Tastes like shit.'</p>, <p>Far too bitter for his tastes.</p>, <p>\"Do consider our offer.

The place... Everything about it.</p>, <p>It felt extremely stuffy.</p>, <p>\"....How many does that make?\"</p>, <p>A familiar voice reached him from behind. As he turned around, his eyes fell on the familiar figure and he flatly replied.</p>, <p>\"Counting that... About nine.\"</p>, <p> \".....A lot more than I thought.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn scratched the side of her face. Wearing a formal white dress, decorated with purple jewelry and accessories, her appearance attracted the gazes of many of the people attending.</p>, <p>It was hard to stand out given that most of the cadets present looked good themselves, but only a few truly stood out amongst the masses.</p>, <p>Evelyn was one of those few.</p>, <p>\"Probably not as many as the times you've got asked out.\"</p>, <p>\"Rubbing salt to my wounds?\"</p>, <p>Leon lightly shrugged.</p>, <p>\"You started it.\"</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn nodded before her brows knit together. She then tactfully said,</p>, <p>\"Have you never considered their offer...? From what I know, they're quite good. A lot better than what you're currently receiving.\"</p>, <p>\"Perhaps...\"</p>, <p>\"But?\"</p>, <p>\"....I can't leave.\"</p>, <p>The Evenus Household.</p>, <p>Leon's thoughts regarding them were rather complicated. They hadn't exactly been the nicest to him.</p>, <p>Only once he had started to display his talent did their attitude towards him change. Before then... He was a servant.</p>, <p>Someone that they were willing to discard with a thought.</p>, <p>The wounds of his past were still vividly etched in his mind and not a day passed where he forgot. Even now... He was constantly reminded of those days.</p>, <p>And it was with such thoughts that he ambiguously added,</p>, <p>\"....Not yet.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>As if she had expected such an answer, Evelyn nodded her head and no longer pursued the matter.</p>, <p>She could tell it was a sensitive matter.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's expression changed and her eyes stared off in the distance. Leon followed her line of sight and made a similar expression.</p>, <p>Julien, the first son of the household in question, appeared at the end of the hall.</p>, <p>He was also one of the few that stood out in appearance. His every movement and action attracted the eyes of those present.</p>, <p>It was hard to not take note of him when he stood out that much.</p>, <p>\"He's changed quite a bit...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn started to speak as her eyes traced his figure.</p>, <p>\"Though he carries himself in the same manner as in the past, there's something different about him. Am I the only one that's noticing these changes?\"</p>, <p>\"...It's been five years since you've last seen him.\"</p>, <p>Leon replied flatly.</p>, <p>\"It's normal for him to be different.\"</p>, <p>\"I guess you're right, but...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn narrowed her eyes as her gaze continued to trace Julien's figure.</p>, <p>\"....Wasn't he usually the type of guy that enjoys attention? Why does it seem like he's leaving?\"</p>, <p>\"Leaving?\"</p>, <p>Leon's face finally showed changes, and to his surprise, it was indeed as Evelyn pointed out.</p>, <p>Julien, who had reached the entrance of the hall, was reaching out for his felt jacket.</p>, <p>His actions aroused the attention of many of those attending.</p>, <p>\"What's he doing?\"</p>, <p>\"Did he forget something in his jacket...?\"</p>, <p>It couldn't be helped.</p>, <p>The event had only just begun, and he was already leaving.</p>, <p>The expressions of many of the people present varied. But the consensus was that his decision made no sense.</p>, <p>This was especially so for Leon who put his drink down.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"You're leaving?\"</p>, <p>\"....Yeah.\"</p>, <p>He had no choice but to.</p>, <p>It was his duty to keep Julien safe. Though he wasn't sure why Julien was acting like this, he had no choice but to follow.</p>, <p>Before leaving, he paused to stare at Evelyn.</p>, <p>\"I hope you enjoy the gathering.\"</p>, <p>And with those last words, he went ahead to follow Julien.</p>, <p>As he left, Evelyn's eyes traced his back.</p>, <p>Putting her drink down, she mumbled,</p>, <p>\".....Something's off.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Huuu...\"</p>, <p>The breeze hit my face as I left the venue.</p>, <p>I felt a sense of liberation coming out of the building.</p>, <p>The weight of the stares...</p>, <p>The suffocating environment...</p>, <p>It was all gone.</p>, <p>I could finally breathe properly again.</p>, <p>\"Better.\"</p>, <p>\".....Why did you leave so early?\"</p>, <p>An expected voice reached me from behind. I didn't need to look to know who it was.</p>, <p>\"I felt like it was a waste of time.\"</p>, <p>\"Were you trying hard enough? I doubt you're intimidating to the point where everyone avoids you.\"</p>, <p>Was that the case...?</p>, <p>I thought about it for a while before nodding.</p>, <p>That was probably the case.</p>, <p>\"Maybe so.\"</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"This sort of thing... I'm not fit for it.\"</p>, <p>My body and mind rejected it.</p>, <p>\"It felt too stuffy. I don't think I could've stayed much longer.\"</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>For the first time since meeting him, I heard a long sigh coming from Leon. Stunned, I turned around to see him massaging his forehead.</p>, <p>Eventually, as if resigned, he also loosened his clothes.</p>, <p>\"To be honest, I was feeling the same.\"</p>, <p>Taken aback by his response, my brow raised.</p>, <p>He was?</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"No, nothing...\"</p>, <p>I shook my head and turned to look away.</p>, <p>\"I'm just glad we're on the same page.\"</p>, <p>I smiled and massaged my shoulders. Then, without looking back, I took the path back to Haven.</p>, <p>The distance back wasn't very far.</p>, <p>Rather, it should've been a very short walk. The path was also nice. With no buildings in sight, it provided a great view.</p>, <p>The entire time the two of us remained quiet as we observed the surroundings.</p>, <p>There wasn't much to say between us and all we could do was enjoy the surroundings.</p>, <p>Everything was going smoothly, when...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>My feet came to a stop.</p>, <p>\"Something's wrong...\"</p>, <p>The path, which should've been a short one suddenly felt extremely long. What should've been a ten to five-minute walk extended longer than that.</p>, <p>I had just turned around to address Leon when my body froze.</p>, <p>\"Hey, did yo—Uh?\"</p>, <p>My heart dropped and my heartbeat quickened.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I was alone.</p>, <p>Leon was gone.</p>, <p>When did this…?</p>, <p>I could've sworn I had felt his presence just moments prior. So when did he…</p>, <p>\"Hooo...\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath to calm my nerves which were steadily rising.</p>, <p>Panic was starting to set in, but I was quick to push it down.</p>, <p>\"Good thing I trained myself for these situations...\"</p>, <p>Though I was still in the beginning stages, I didn't let fear cloud my mind. Take control of my body.</p>, <p>And just as I managed to calm myself down…</p>, <p>Blink—</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>The world changed with a single blink.</p>, <p>The familiar path disappeared, and replacing it was a dense forest.</p>, <p>Trees surrounded me from all sides while the moon hung in the sky.</p>, <p>It was a familiar environment and my heartbeat, which I had barely managed to calm, started beating crazily.</p>, <p>Ba... Thump! Ba... Thump!</p>, <p>It drummed powerfully in my mind, overtaking my thoughts.</p>, <p>\"This place...\"</p>, <p>A familiar environment.</p>, <p>One that I distinctly remembered even now that a week had passed.</p>, <p>\"Vision.\"</p>, <p>Only one word escaped from my mouth, but it was all I needed to say to understand my situation.</p>, <p>This place, the trees, the moon that hung in the sky... It was all from the vision I had seen last week.</p>, <p>\"It can't be...\"</p>, <p>A part of me wanted to refuse the situation. Deny that this was really happening, but...</p>, <p>Staring at the familiar environment, I knew this was the reality.</p>, <p>My reality.</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>A curse inexplicable escaped from my mouth as my heart drummed with even more force.</p>, <p>It beat with such force that it made it hard to think.</p>, <p>And the fear that I so tried to suppress once again started to take over my mind.</p>, <p>My palms felt sweaty...</p>, <p>My breath grew heavy...</p>, <p>And my mind started to cloud.</p>, <p>\"....I have to go.\"</p>, <p>But even in all of this, I was able to retain some rationality.</p>, <p>I hadn't suffered so much for nothing.</p>, <p>'Let's think.'</p>, <p>My memories of the event were still clear in my mind.</p>, <p>All the details from then were still vividly etched in my mind.</p>, <p>'In the vision, I recall heading a certain direction...'</p>, <p>It started with me running in a certain direction before meeting a hooded figure who then proceeded to kill me.</p>, <p>I looked around and searched for all the details.</p>, <p>Eventually, a direction became clear to me.</p>, <p>\"The hooded figure is that way.\"</p>, <p>That much was clear.</p>, <p>But what now...?</p>, <p>Run?</p>, <p>That seemed to be the only logical conclusion.

It wasn't that he was worried about Julien. He was unsure of the depth of his strength.</p>, <p>Was he stronger or weaker than him?</p>, <p>.....Leon wasn't exactly sure.</p>, <p>But he had no time to ponder over this matter any longer. Sensing something, his expression changed and he lightly stomped his foot on the ground, pushing himself back.</p>, <p>BANG--!</p>, <p>Just as his body moved, the spot which he had been standing on just moments prior, exploded.</p>, <p>Pieces of debris flew in the air as a cloud of dust rose in the air, masking Leon's sight.</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>A rough voice echoed shortly after.</p>, <p>As the cloud cleared, a hulking figure draped in a large black hood emerged, casually holding an axe over their shoulder.</p>, <p>\"...You're a lot more slippery than I thought.\"</p>, <p>He began to say, the air trembling at the tone of his voice.</p>, <p>Leon's eyes narrowed as he slowly unsheathed the sword from his hips.</p>, <p>SHIIIIIING--!</p>, <p>He looked around before saying,</p>, <p>\"Where is this? And who are you?\"</p>, <p>Rather than answering, the hooded figure massaged its chin.</p>, <p>\"I was told you were different. As expected... You really are different. I didn't think you'd be this composed in this situation.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Leon remained silent.</p>, <p>He was carefully scoping out his surroundings. Areas where he could escape in case he couldn't handle his opponent, advantages he could use, and so on...</p>, <p>Nothing escaped his sight.</p>, <p>\"I see what you're trying to do.\"</p>, <p>Almost faintly, Leon caught what appeared to be a smile under the hood.</p>, <p>\"Commendable. Observing your surroundings to increase your advantages. Finding escape points in case you're at a disadvantage... I can see what you're trying to do. But...\"</p>, <p>BANG--!</p>, <p>Stomping his foot on the ground, the hooded figure disappeared from his spot, reappearing right in front of Leon in less than a second.</p>, <p>Axe held with both hands, he whispered.</p>, <p>\"Just like the other guy... There's no escape for the two of you...\"</p>, <p>Swooosh--</p>, <p>And he swung down.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>How long has it been...?</p>, <p>One hour? Two hours? Three hours? A day?</p>, <p>I had lost track of time.</p>, <p>I hadn't moved the entire time and kept my focus entirely on the magic circle in front of me.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>One rune.</p>, <p>Two runes.</p>, <p>Three runes...</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>Eight runes...</p>, <p>Nine runes...</p>, <p>Ten runes...</p>, <p>Eleven runes...</p>, <p>Tzzzz--!</p>, <p>\"Kh...!\"</p>, <p>I still...</p>, <p>Couldn't...</p>, <p>Make...</p>, <p>Any...</p>, <p>Progress.</p>, <p>Even after all this time!!</p>, <p>After doing everything that I possibly could...!</p>, <p>\"Shit... Why?! Why...!\"</p>, <p>Was I just being too hasty? Was that it...?</p>, <p>'From what I was told, simply learning to be able to use a spell shouldn't take more than a few hours...'</p>, <p>So long as one was adept at it, they could learn it.</p>, <p>It was what I had learned in the two weeks I had been in this world.</p>, <p>So...?</p>, <p>Tzzzz--!</p>, <p>\"Why...?\"</p>, <p>Why was it that I still couldn't learn it?</p>, <p>Did I need more time?</p>, <p>But I didn't have time.</p>, <p>This was the only thing I could do. My other power couldn't be used to fight the person in the vision.</p>, <p>There was nothing else I could do.</p>, <p>This was my only option.</p>, <p>\"H-haaa...\"</p>, <p>My breath betrayed my exasperation as I blankly stared at the night sky.</p>, <p>Was this my limit...?</p>, <p>No, if I only had more time.</p>, <p>Then... Then...</p>, <p>\"Kh...\"</p>, <p>I quietly called out for my status screen.</p>, <p>A large window appeared in my vision.</p>, <p>Type : Elemental [Curse]</p>, <p>Why...</p>, <p>Why was it that I was able to grasp Emotive Magic so easily, and yet struggled to understand this magic?</p>, <p>Was it because of my ability?</p>, <p>...Or was it because I wasn't truly capable of understanding this magic?</p>, <p>Yet again, I was reminded of one fact.</p>, <p>I didn't belong to the world.</p>, <p>\"Right... I'm just an existence that casually entered this place.\"</p>, <p>The reason why I was struggling so much...</p>, <p>Why it was so hard for me to learn...</p>, <p>It had nothing to do with talent.</p>, <p>I...</p>, <p>Was simply, not meant to have learned it.</p>, <p>This world...</p>, <p>I smiled bitterly.</p>, <p>\"...It's rejecting me.\"</p>, <p>Haha.</p>, <p>It was a laughable thought.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Even if the world was rejecting me.</p>, <p>I had no choice but to continue.</p>, <p>\"...Again.\"</p>, <p>I stared at my hand and channeled the mana from my abdomen.</p>, <p>A familiar warmth flooded my body.</p>, <p>One rune...</p>, <p>Two runes...</p>, <p>Three runes...</p>, <p>Five runes...</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>Tzzzz--!</p>, <p>I tasted failure.</p>, <p>Over.</p>, <p>And over.</p>, <p>And over again.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>Blood continuously dripped down from my nose as my eyes grew blurry.</p>, <p>I was getting tired.</p>, <p>Tired of the meaningless practice that held no progress.</p>, <p>It had stopped at eleven runes.</p>, <p>There was just one rune that I was missing before the magic circle would complete.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Tzzzz--!</p>, <p>That step seemed an impossible one.</p>, <p>It slowly started to sink in my mind.</p>, <p>'....This is meaningless.'</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Tzzzz--!</p>, <p>\"Why waste time...\"</p>, <p>Tzzzz--!</p>, <p>\"Practicing something...\"</p>, <p>Tzzzz--!</p>, <p>\"....That wields no progress?\"</p>, <p>I finally lowered my hand and closed my eyes.</p>, <p>My mana reserves were almost empty and exhaustion had taken over my body.</p>, <p>\"In the end... I was just meaninglessly struggling.\"</p>, <p>Chasing after something I wasn't meant to achieve.</p>, <p>If I had more time then...</p>, <p>I'd have pursued things differently.</p>, <p>But I had run out of time.</p>, <p>\"Cough...! Cough...!\"</p>, <p>My hands stained with my blood as a familiar fire raged up in my lungs.</p>, <p>It became even clearer to me that my time was up.</p>, <p>And as if to further confirm this, the nearby greenery rustled.</p>, <p>Rustle--!</p>, <p>A hooded figure emerged from behind the bushes.</p>, <p>\"So that's where you were. You really made it hard for me to find you. Thankfully, I was able to track you through your scent, or I really would've never been able to find you.\"</p>, <p>His poise.</p>, <p>His voice...</p>, <p>They were all similar to the one in the vision.</p>, <p>Finally, he stopped and stared at me.</p>, <p>\"...Uh?\"</p>, <p>A surprised sound escaped his lips as he stared at me.</p>, <p>\"Would you look at that? I knew you were weak from your mana signature, but I didn't think you'd be this weak--\"</p>, <p>\"....Is that so?\"</p>, <p>With what little energy I had left, my voice layered and I forced myself up, dashing away from the area.</p>, <p>\"Hoho?

It's a good thing I came prepared.\"</p>, <p>Rustle--</p>, <p>I ran through the forest, feeling the rough branches scrape against my skin.</p>, <p>The underbrush clawed at my legs, leaving stinging cuts all over.</p>, <p>But I paid them no mind.</p>, <p>One Rune...</p>, <p>Two Runes...</p>, <p>As I ran, I made sure to focus my attention on my hand.</p>, <p>The runes were slowly piling up.</p>, <p>Tzzzz--!</p>, <p>But even in such a situation, failure seemed inevitable.</p>, <p>I gritted my teeth and continued running.</p>, <p>The situation seemed hopeless.</p>, <p>My Emotive Magic seemed to not affect him. I couldn't comprehend the other magic, and I was on my last breath.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>At some point, my leg wobbled.</p>, <p>Crash...</p>, <p>And I fell face-first against the ground.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>I scraped the ground in an attempt to help myself up.</p>, <p>But..</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>I couldn't get up.</p>, <p>Sweat poured down from the side of my face as my chest burned with even greater intensity than before.</p>, <p>My lungs were on fire.</p>, <p>\"....Already tired?\"</p>, <p>The hooded man appeared behind me, seemingly confused by my situation.</p>, <p>Just barely, I managed to turn my body to face him.</p>, <p>\"I thought you'd struggle more, Black Star.

All she did was follow the mana trace from the spell to get to where they were.</p>, <p>It wasn't that far. Took her no time to get there and oversee the situation.</p>, <p>In case they couldn't handle them, she'd interfere.</p>, <p>She had been prepared to interfere during Julien's struggle, but...</p>, <p>Yet again...</p>, <p>He showed her why she had selected him as the Black Star. His anger... desperation... she could feel it from where she was.</p>, <p>The image of his expression lingered in her mind even until now.</p>, <p>To the point where she opened her lips to mutter,</p>, <p>\"Anger...\"</p>, <p>Her hands trembled, but it wasn't much.</p>, <p>Nothing compared to how he did it.</p>, <p>Her expression showed signs of cracking as she faintly smiled.</p>, <p> \"....I guess he's better than me.\"</p>, <p>In the Emotive field, that was.</p>, <p>It was a funny thought.</p>, <p>It wasn't as though she was talented in such a field.

More specifically, toward his forearm, where a familiar tattoo rested.</p>, <p>She wanted to see what he'd do in such a situation. Catch him lacking... but he never faltered. His performance was flawless.</p>, <p>To the point where Delilah started to question herself.</p>, <p>'....Am I wrong?'</p>, <p>But clearly, the tattoo he had was the same...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her delicate brows gently knit together.</p>, <p>\"What a headache.\"</p>, <p>Flicking her hand, Julien's body levitated upwards.

There were no life-threatening injuries.</p>, <p>He was at most tired.</p>, <p>As for his broken bones and body...</p>, <p>That much could be handled by the infirmary. It would take at most a couple of days for him to be fully healed.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Sensing something, Delilah's head turned to face the distance. She felt a subtle mana trace coming from there.</p>, <p>That's when she recalled.</p>, <p>\"Ah, right.\"</p>, <p>There was someone else that was here.</p>, <p>Her form gradually started to blend with the world alongside Julien's. Before long, the two of them disappeared.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>Just as the two of them left, a change started to take place in the surroundings.</p>, <p>The broken trees in the distance started to repair, the body on the ground shattered in fragments, and everything returned to how it had been a few hours prior.</p>, <p>Rustle—</p>, <p>The trees rustled under the breeze of the wind, and all traces of what had been disappeared.</p>, <p>It was as if nothing had ever happened...</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Dark.</p>, <p>My vision was dark.</p>, <p>And it was cold.</p>, <p>But that cold didn't last for long.</p>, <p>Something warm embraced my body. It felt nice.</p>, <p>To the point where I wanted to bask in it for a little longer. But... I knew I couldn't. This comfort... It wasn't something that I was meant to enjoy.</p>, <p>My reality wasn't as comfortable as this.</p>, <p>That much I knew.</p>, <p>As if a switch had been flipped, my eyes opened, and light entered my vision.</p>, <p>\"W-where am I...?\"</p>, <p>That was the first thing I thought when I looked up.</p>, <p>It was a white ceiling. One I wasn't familiar with. My head shifted, and I managed to look down.</p>, <p>I was lying in bed.</p>, <p>The room I was in wasn't anything big. With a wooden table opposite the bed and a metal cabinet, the room felt rather lacking.</p>, <p>It was bland.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The pungent smell of alcohol lingered in the air as my nose scrunched up. The sterile scent hinted at the fact that I was in some sort of medical center.</p>, <p>But where exactly?</p>, <p>\"Ukh...\"</p>, <p>Just as I thought to check, my face stiffened.</p>, <p>My entire body was in pain, and I could barely lift my head.</p>, <p>But I also understood something...</p>, <p>'I am safe.'</p>, <p>I didn't know why I felt this way. The place was unfamiliar, and yet... I didn't feel like I was in any danger.</p>, <p>Of course, even if I was in danger... I didn't have the time to think about it.</p>, <p>\"Ukhg...!\"</p>, <p>Memories from before started to flood my mind, and my stomach churned.</p>, <p>I hastily looked around before leaning over the bedside.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>\"Blergh...!\"</p>, <p>Once again, I puked.</p>, <p>\"Blergh...!\"</p>, <p>It all came out at once. I wasn't able to hold it and just flowed out from my stomach.</p>, <p>\"Blergh...!\"</p>, <p>My throat hurt and my eyes started to sting.</p>, <p>I was also struggling to breathe as I barely had any time to catch my breath. It was just endless.</p>, <p>The reality of the situation finally started to hit me...</p>, <p>I had killed someone.</p>, <p>\"...Haa...\"</p>, <p>It wasn't so much that I was distraught by that idea. He had been trying to kill me... I was merely defending myself.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>As I recalled the way that I killed him.</p>, <p>The blood that spilled with each swing.</p>, <p>The smell of it as it invaded my nostrils.</p>, <p>The pieces of his brain that splattered...</p>, <p>\"Blergh...!\"</p>, <p>My stomach once again turned over, and I continued to puke.</p>, <p>But this time...</p>, <p>Nothing came out. I only made the sound, but nothing came out. I had emptied my entire stomach. There was nothing left for me to puke.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I wiped my lips and took deep and even breaths.</p>, <p>I felt like utter shit.</p>, <p>Every time I thought back to the memories, my mouth would gag. I wished I could forget all about that memory and just move on, but...</p>, <p>'I can't forget.'</p>, <p>I mustn't forget.</p>, <p>Like I said, it was time for me to accept the world.</p>, <p>Who I now was... And the morals of this world. I had to accept them. I couldn't stay as Emmet Rowe forever. I had to... become Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>The world didn't reject me.</p>, <p>I rejected it.</p>, <p>And it was time for me to accept it.</p>, <p>From its laws to its morals... I needed to conform my way of thinking to it.</p>, <p>Only this way would I be able to find what I wanted.</p>, <p>Therefore, I closed my eyes and replayed the scene in my mind. Over and over again. I tried to recall all the details. From the sounds to the smells... all that I could think of.</p>, <p>I tried to recall.</p>, <p>\"...Ukgh.\"</p>, <p>My throat gagged each time, but I let my mind immerse in the memories.</p>, <p>I knew that this wasn't going to be enough.</p>, <p>That it was going to take time for me to adjust to this sort of mentality, but... One had to start from somewhere.</p>, <p>And this was my starting point.</p>, <p>Creaaaaak...</p>, <p>The door of the room creaked open as a figure draped in white robes entered. With tall blonde hair and green eyes, he scanned the room and sighed.</p>, <p>\"...I was wondering why there was so much sound.\"</p>, <p>He flicked his hand once, and all the puke on the floor disappeared. So did the smell, which made me feel better.</p>, <p>\"Let's start with the introduction. I'm Dr. Gabel Wright. I'm in charge of healing you.\"</p>, <p>\"...Oh.\"</p>, <p>I lowered my eyes and sat back.</p>, <p>\"Am I at the institute?\"</p>, <p>\"Oh? You're aware?\"</p>, <p>\"Mhm.\"</p>, <p>It wasn't that hard to figure out. I had been thinking about it for a bit, but was it really possible for something like this to happen under the watch of the institute that boasted itself to be the number one in the empire?</p>, <p>No...</p>, <p>That was most likely not the case.</p>, <p>But... If that was the case, why did something like this happen? Were they just incompetent.. or was there more to it?</p>, <p>'Fucking game.'</p>, <p>\"The Chancellor personally brought you back here in the middle of the night. Nobody is aware that you're here yet.\"</p>, <p>Taking out a wooden pad, the doctor glanced at it before continuing.</p>, <p>\"...Broken collarbone, three fractured ribs, a punctured lung, spinal fracture... What sort of situation did you get yourself into?\"</p>, <p>\"Haa..\"</p>, <p>I inwardly laughed. I wanted to know, too.</p>, <p>In the end, I was going to be stuck here for a bit...</p>, <p>Great.</p>, <p>\"Well...\"</p>, <p>Putting the clipboard down, he ruffled his hair.</p>, <p>\"The injuries aren't anything serious or anything like that.\"</p>, <p>\"...?\"</p>, <p>\"So you should be fine with leaving by tomorrow.\"</p>, <p>\"...??\"</p>, <p>\"I'll be leaving to check on my other patients. Rest for now. I'll come to check up on you later.\"</p>, <p>He left just like that.</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>The door closed and silence enveloped the room. I thought back to his words and found myself blinking twice...</p>, <p>\"Injuries aren't anything serious...?\"</p>, <p>Broken collarbone, three fractured ribs, a punctured lung, spinal fracture...</p>, <p>\"Should be fine to leave by tomorrow?\"</p>, <p>This...</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>I couldn't help but laugh.</p>, <p>Although this was another world... It still left me stunned.</p>, <p>\"...Fucking ridiculous.\"</p>, <p>\"What is?\"</p>, <p>\"No, it's...!\"</p>, <p>I abruptly looked to my left, and my eyes widened.</p>, <p>When did she...</p>, <p>Leaning against the nearest table, her long, flowing black hair draped down her shoulder as she cocked her head.</p>, <p>Her appearance was so blinding that I struggled to comprehend what was before me.</p>, <p>\"So...? What's so ridiculous?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Memories started to flood my mind, and I felt my face stiffen. It took me no time to figure out who the woman before me was.</p>, <p>One of the seven Monarchs.</p>, <p>The one who was closest to the Zenith.</p>, <p>Delilah V. Rosemberg.</p>]\n",

Have you heard of it before?\"</p>, <p>\"....No.\"</p>, <p>My answer remained the same.</p>, <p>I really hadn't heard of it before.</p>, <p>It was when I felt my breath leave my body that she finally released her grip on my forearm, and everything returned to normal.</p>, <p>Only then did I feel like I could finally breathe again.</p>, <p>\"You don't seem to be lying.\"</p>, <p>She cocked her head lightly, pinching her chin as she leaned back on the wooden table.</p>, <p>\"Strange, so strange…\"</p>, <p>'What's going on with her?'</p>, <p>Her behavior was really strange. While she certifiably carried herself as someone of importance, she also gave off a rather odd feeling.</p>, <p>Like…</p>, <p>'Scary.'</p>, <p>I couldn't quite put it into words.</p>, <p>But she seemed to have two sides of her. A normal one, and one that felt extremely scary. Just recalling her eyes made me shudder.</p>, <p>'I wonder which side of her is the real one?'</p>, <p>\"Are you thinking something weird?\"</p>, <p>I almost flinched but barely held myself back before shaking my head.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>How did she know?</p>, <p>\"…..\"</p>, <p>Her sharp gaze fell on me, and I felt my back shudder.</p>, <p>Thankfully, it was only for a brief moment before she said,</p>, <p>\"Your extra-curricular activity. The Comedy Club...\"</p>, <p>\"….Yes?\"</p>, <p>Why was she suddenly bringing it up?</p>, <p>\"I've put your application on hold.\"</p>, <p>Hold?</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>\"….\"</p>, <p>She didn't answer immediately and stared at me. Her gaze didn't feel as pressuring this time.</p>, <p>Then…</p>, <p>\"You're weak.\"</p>, <p>She said something I was all too aware of.</p>, <p>\"The weakest Black Star. That's what some people call you.\"</p>, <p>\"…\"</p>, <p>I pursed my lips.</p>, <p>\"….I was the one that nominated you as the Black Star.\"</p>, <p>\"…\"</p>, <p>\"And my decision was the correct one.\"</p>, <p>Surprised, I felt my eyes widen.\"</p>, <p>\"Instead of joining the Comedy Club, become my assistant.\"</p>, <p>\"….!\"</p>, <p>\"I won't be able to teach you much, and I won't protect you, but whenever I'm free, you can ask me for advice. You're talented in the Emotive field but untalented in the other.\"</p>, <p>For the first time, her face showed signs of cracking.</p>, <p>\"…..That fifth state I told you about.\"</p>, <p>Her lips gently pulled up.</p>, <p>\"I wonder if you can achieve it.\"</p>, <p>Her figure gradually blurred, disappearing from my sight like a gust of wind. But not before leaving a few words behind.</p>, <p>\"Think about it.\"</p>, <p>Like that, she was gone.</p>, <p>\"…\"</p>, <p>I stood blankly on the spot for a couple of seconds before finally snapping out of it.</p>, <p>Did the one closest to the Zenith just ask me to become their assistant?</p>, <p>\"This is ridiculous…\"</p>, <p>The entire situation was.</p>, <p>Her motive was rather obvious. For whatever reason, she wanted to observe me. It perhaps had something to do with the tattoo on my hand, but I wasn't sure.</p>, <p>For now, it seemed to be the most plausible reason.</p>, <p>'Should I refuse the offer?'</p>, <p>It was certainly a good offer.</p>, <p>However, I also understood that it wasn't one without its motives.</p>, <p>But the more I thought about it, the more I realized how beneficial it was to me. To have someone as strong as her occasionally give me tips on an area I lacked… How many people would be jealous of that?</p>, <p>She also wasn't forcing me to become her assistant.</p>, <p>It was an offer.</p>, <p>Whether I took it or not was up to me.</p>, <p>Creeeaakk—</p>, <p>The door of the room opened all of a sudden, and a familiar figure entered. With a cast over his arm, he didn't look to be in the greatest of conditions.</p>, <p>Right, he also must've...</p>, <p>I was the first one to speak.</p>, <p>\"….I take it you didn't have a great time.\"</p>, <p>\"I did not.\"</p>, <p>He looked at me up and down.</p>, <p>\"….You seemed to have had a better time.\"</p>, <p>\"Ha, yes.\"</p>, <p>My entire body felt like it was breaking. Every single movement hurt, and my mind was not in the best of shape.</p>, <p>Leon casually looked around and tilted his head.</p>, <p>\"Was someone here?\"</p>, <p>I raised my brow.</p>, <p>How could he tell?</p>, <p>\"The smell.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>That made sense. I proceeded to recount my events with the Chancellor. I didn't tell him everything and left a few things out. I still couldn't trust him. But I told him about the general situation and her offer.</p>, <p>His response after hearing all of it was…</p>, <p>\"You should take the offer.\"</p>, <p>\"You think?\"</p>, <p>\"It's a great opportunity for you. I wouldn't reject it if I were you. It's much better than…\"</p>, <p>He stopped his sentence there as I noticed his left brow twitch.</p>, <p>I cocked my head.</p>, <p>\"Better than what?\"</p>, <p>\"….Ehm.\"</p>, <p>His eyes darted away from me, and he rigidly turned to face the door.</p>, <p>\"I have to go.\"</p>, <p>\"Why can't a nose be twelve inches long?\"</p>, <p>He visibly flinched, and his expression changed.</p>, <p>At that moment, I recalled Delilah's words.</p>, <p>'It is said that when an Emotive Mage reaches the last stage in their path, the fifth stage of completion and the perfect path, they become capable of seeing emotions.'</p>, <p>Staring at Leon, I could certainly see it.</p>, <p>The emotion he was feeling.</p>, <p>Fear.</p>, <p>Had I already reached that stage?</p>, <p>Hmm.</p>, <p>Obviously not.</p>, <p>But…</p>, <p>\"I-\"</p>, <p>Staring at Leon, I nodded my head.</p>, <p>Poor soul.</p>, <p>\"…..Because then it'd be a foot.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was after two days that I was finally allowed out of the infirmary.</p>, <p>Though I was released, my body was still in pain. I hurt all over, and every single movement made me flinch.</p>, <p>\"Huaaam....\"</p>, <p>I was also rather sleepy. The pain made it hard for me to sleep. I was the type of person that moved a lot during their sleep, so...</p>, <p>\".....What a pain.\"</p>, <p>The current time was 5:30 P.M.</p>, <p>It was currently Monday, and the week had already started. Because it was already so late, I had pretty much skipped all the lessons that I was set to attend.</p>, <p>It was a bit of a pity considering that I was already lagging behind compared to the others, but what could I do?</p>, <p>'At least, I can use magic now...'</p>, <p>This wasn't exactly the most ideal situation for me.</p>, <p>Thankfully, all hope wasn't lost. The Extracurricular activities were set to start today. My choice was already set.</p>, <p>I was going to accept Delilah's offer to be her 'assistant'.</p>, <p>Whether her goal was to keep a close watch on me or something else, I didn't care.</p>, <p>If it was going to benefit me, then so be it.</p>, <p>I...</p>, <p>Will do anything to get stronger.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"I'm glad you decided to take my offer.\"</p>, <p>Delilah stood waiting for me at the entrance of the Rottingham Hall. I thought her appearance would attract the attention of all those around us, but...</p>, <p>'How weird.'</p>, <p>Nobody was glancing our way. It was almost as if we didn't exist.</p>, <p>Why...</p>, <p>That was when Delilah's voice reached my ears.</p>, <p>\"I've cast a spell that makes it hard for others to notice our presence.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>To think that there was such a spell.</p>, <p>Impressive.</p>, <p>\"Come, follow me.\"</p>, <p>Tak—</p>, <p>Her heels gently clicked against the marble floor as she walked into the hall. I followed her from behind.</p>, <p>'Wow...'</p>, <p>As we walked, I couldn't help but admire the interior structure.</p>, <p>The building had a square shape, featuring a large opening at the top for sunlight. In the middle of the hall, there was a spacious garden with neatly arranged flowers, trees, and benches. Adjacent to the garden, small pillars separated it from the corridor where we were walking.</p>, <p>It was a breathtaking sight.</p>, <p>One that I didn't want to take my eyes away from.</p>, <p> \"It's nice isn't it?\"</p>, <p>Delilah continued to lead me forward, her eyes never once looking at the garden to our left.</p>, <p>\"You might as well get used to it since you'll be working with me from now on.\"</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>We continued to walk for a bit before going up a flight of stairs leading up to the second floor where we finally stopped in front of a large wooden door.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Delilah stood in front of the door for a couple of seconds without saying a word. Just when I thought something was wrong, she twisted the door and opened it revealing her office space.</p>, <p>I stopped dead in my tracks and looked up.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>We both stood at the entrance without saying a word.</p>, <p>That was until I felt compelled to speak.</p>, <p>\"Quit... I'm allowed to quit, right?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>A flat-out refusal.</p>, <p>Expressionless, Delilah surveyed her surroundings before making her way to her desk positioned at the room's far end. The desk was situated right behind a large window that flooded the entire space with natural light.</p>, <p>As she headed for her desk, Delilah carefully walked around the stacks of papers and wrappers that littered the ground.</p>, <p>How would I even begin to describe this place...?</p>, <p>A dump? A mess?</p>, <p>It was...</p>, <p>\"I'm a very busy person.\"</p>, <p>Delilah went on to say.</p>, <p>\"....I don't have time to clean up.\"</p>, <p>She sat down on her desk and reached out for her drawer where even more wrappers spilled. As her hand dug into the drawer, her brows knit together before finally relaxing as she took out a chocolate bar.</p>, <p>Unwrapping it, she tossed the wrapper to the side before placing the bar in her mouth.</p>, <p>Her eyes squinted the moment the bar entered her mouth.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>All I could do was stare at the wrapper that fell to the ground.</p>, <p>'Don't have time to clean up...?'</p>, <p>What sort of nonsense...</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>As if noticing my expression, Delilah turned to look at me. I didn't say anything and just stared at the wrapper on the ground.</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>And then, as if realizing, her head turned.</p>, <p>\".....Force of habit.\"</p>, <p>At least she was honest...</p>, <p>I honestly didn't know how to feel about the situation. On one hand, I started to think that maybe I had fallen for a trap.</p>, <p>That her goal in having me become her assistant was so that I could help her clean up. But I knew this was ridiculous.</p>, <p>Someone of her stature could surely hire someone to clean up her mess.</p>, <p>On the other hand, I was stumped.</p>, <p>One of the Seven Monarchs.</p>, <p>The one closest to the Zenith.</p>, <p>....Was this her real personality?</p>, <p>This...</p>, <p>I wasn't sure how to feel.</p>, <p>\"So...\"</p>, <p>Delilah's voice reached my ears. I turned to look at her. Staring at me with an expression of utmost seriousness, she glanced around. She didn't say a word, but her meaning was clear.</p>, <p>Only that...</p>, <p>I pointed toward my mouth.</p>, <p>\"You've got...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>There were over a hundred different extracurricular activities that were offered to the first-year cadets.</p>, <p>Amongst them, the most popular were [Magic Theory and Expertise], and [Sword Unification and Mana Composition].</p>, <p>Because the two clubs shared similar elements, today the classes were unified.</p>, <p>A group of four stood at the end of the training room.</p>, <p>\"What happened to you? Why did you skip today's lessons?\"</p>, <p>Each of them was dressed in robes, and their appearances and demenour attracted the attention of all those present. It couldn't be helped. They were the top four rankers of the first year. Leon, Aoife, Evelyn, and Luxon.</p>, <p>\"Can't you see from his hand that he got injured?\"</p>, <p>These were the words of Luxon, a young man with brown hair and deep blue eyes. He was ranked fifth amongst the first years, and just like Leon, he was a knight.</p>, <p>\"Uh, yeah... I noticed.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn, who was staring at Leon's hand, tilted her head.</p>, <p>\"How did yo—\"</p>, <p>She stopped herself mid-sentence and her eyes opened.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>There was someone else that had been missing today.</p>, <p>Could it be...</p>, <p>She looked at Leon who was blankly staring into the distance, his thoughts unknown.</p>, <p>\"It's probably not what you're thinking.\"</p>, <p>Aoife, who had been quiet the entire time, finally spoke.</p>, <p>\"No. I—\"</p>, <p>\"If the two of them really fought, I don't think the situation would be as quiet as this. The two of them would be in the disciplinary hall.\"</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Fighting among cadets was prohibited. If cadets were caught fighting against each other, they'd be severely punished by the school board.</p>, <p>Still, such rules couldn't stop Evelyn from overthinking.</p>, <p>'But what if they fought without the institute knowing?'</p>, <p>Would the institute interfere then?...And if they really had fought, who won between the two of them?</p>, <p>\"Never mind that...\"</p>, <p>Luxon switched up the conversation.</p>, <p>\"The situation is getting rather troublesome, right?...I thought things would calm down after a while, but it seems like they're hell-bent on pushing us down.\"</p>, <p>\"Right... It's getting quite annoying.\"</p>, <p>Factions were already starting to form between the first years. Primarily, it was the commoners banding up together against the nobles. The situation wasn't hard to handle, however, there were already a few conflicts between the lower-end nobles and commoners.</p>, <p>The worst part of it all was that Aoife had indirectly become the face of the situation when she interfered with an emerging conflict where she ended up defending the lower-end nobles.</p>, <p>Cooly looking into the distance, she said,</p>, <p>\"Two sides were fighting so I just stopped the fight. I interfered without knowing the situation. Because of it... I'm now dragged into this situation. I already warned them that I want no part in this, but they refuse to listen.\"</p>, <p>While the Megrail name held a lot of weight, within the institute, it was a meaningless title.</p>, <p>The only title that actually mattered was that of the Black Star. Such situations were not common as the cadets usually banded with the Black Star.</p>, <p>It was the Black Star's role to stop such meaningless conflict.</p>, <p>But things were different this year with the Black Star not caring at all about creating factions and banding the first years together.</p>, <p>He was the primary reason why a situation like this had happened.</p>, <p>Had she been the Black Star, then...</p>, <p>Aoife quietly bit her lips and looked at Leon.</p>, <p>\"Do you think you can get him to do something?\"</p>, <p>Leon looked down and met Aoife's eyes. He stared at her for a while before shaking his head.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>A flat-out refusal.</p>, <p>\"Even if you force him, he won't do it. He hates these kinds of things.\"</p>, <p>\"Are you sure?\"</p>, <p>When Luxon asked, Leon nodded.</p>, <p>\"Very sure.\"</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>With a curse, Luxon ruffled his hair.</p>, <p>\"....Why did the institute choose someone like him to be the Black Star? If he can't even fulfill his own role, then what's the point in keeping him there? At the rate the situation is going, the first years will be split into different factions. That has never happened before. We'll become the laughingstock of the second and third years.\"</p>, <p>At that, nobody answered. His words held some truth.</p>, <p>With Julien not fulfilling his role as the Black Star, the first years were in a mess.</p>, <p>At the rate they were going, the conflicts would get to the point where they would start interfering with everyone's studies.</p>, <p>The grim reality made Evelyn frown as she asked,</p>, <p>\"What do we do?\"</p>, <p>Aoife, who had been frowning the entire time, suddenly relaxed her brows.</p>, <p>\"There's one thing we can do.\"</p>, <p>Everyone looked at her.</p>, <p>But just as she spoke, Evelyn's eyes widened. So did Luxon's. A figure appeared in their sight.</p>, <p>Gulp—</p>, <p>Evelyn felt a lump in her throat.</p>, <p>With calm and even steps, he neared them.</p>, <p>A perfect face.</p>, <p>With an aura distinct from the others, and cold eyes befitting his visage, he seemed to be the center of attention wherever he went.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>Finally, his expression...</p>, <p>It was extremely cold. Especially his eyes which shone like well-polished jewels.</p>, <p>\"During the mid-terms...\"</p>, <p>He stopped right behind Aoife who finished her sentence.</p>, <p>\"... I'll take the title away from him.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Her face remained blank as she felt a presence behind her. Taking note of the change in expressions of Evelyn and Luxon, Aoife had an idea of what was going on.</p>, <p>She coolly turned her head.</p>, <p>\"You're here.\"</p>, <p>He stood taller than her, her height just barely reaching his chin.</p>, <p>'He heard, didn't he?'</p>, <p>There was no way he hadn't.</p>, <p>\"....I am.\"</p>, <p>Indeed, hearing his confirmation, Aoife closed her eyes briefly. Then, collecting her thoughts, she spoke,</p>, <p>\"Did you hear what I said?\"</p>, <p>\"I have.\"</p>, <p>Julien continued to stare at her with his usual detached eyes.</p>, <p>Aoife calmly stared into those eyes.</p>, <p>'Those arrogant eyes... I wonder how long you'll be able to keep them like that?'</p>, <p>Regardless of whether he had heard her or not, she didn't care. Her goal had always been to reach the top. Become the Zenith.</p>, <p>The fact that she wasn't ranked first in her year was already a huge blow to her ambition.</p>, <p>It wasn't something she had expected.</p>, <p>And for there to be two people who stood above her...</p>, <p>How could she accept something like this?</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>\"The Black Star is not just a title. It is something that comes with responsibility. The situation is as is because you aren't doing your job.\"</p>, <p>Aoife didn't care if she came off as uptight, or annoying. There was a little truth in that. She was self-aware of that much.</p>, <p>However, her words were the truth and the truth only.</p>, <p>\"It is your duty to make sure that all sides get along. Not me, but yours.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Aoife expected Julien to say something back, refute her words, and dismiss her in some way. Give her an excuse to openly challenge him.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>That never came.</p>, <p>Julien's expression eased and he took a step back. Without saying a single word, he turned around to glance into the distance. Where the other students were.</p>, <p>\"....What am I supposed to do?\"</p>, <p>Aoife's brows raised in surprise.</p>, <p>Her reaction was the mildest one. The one who had the greatest reaction was Evelyn who opened her eyes and looked at Julien with an expression that seemed as though she couldn't believe what she was seeing.</p>, <p>No, she really couldn't believe what she was seeing.</p>, <p>\"I never asked to be the Black Star...\"</p>, <p>He started to speak while glancing into the distance. His hazel eyes shone under the light of the sun while his well-kept hair swayed lightly under the breeze.</p>, <p> Aoife quietly listened to his words, her hands silently tensing. She was expecting him to look at her in disdain while saying something along the lines of, 'Do it yourself. Don't bother me with these meaningless tasks.'</p>, <p>She could already envision the scene in her mind.</p>, <p>\"...But just because I didn't ask to become the Black Star doesn't mean that I don't care for it. I have it, so I'd like to keep it.\"</p>, <p>However, to her surprise, he did none of that.</p>, <p>Rather, he did something completely out of her expectations.</p>, <p>\"So...\"</p>, <p>Lowering his head slightly, he deeply looked at everyone present.</p>, <p>\".....Tell me what I'm supposed to do when the time comes.\"</p>, <p>Following his words, he walked past them.</p>, <p>Aoife stood dazed even as his scent faded away.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She just stood blankly on the spot.</p>, <p>The same was true for the others.</p>, <p>\"Did he just...\"</p>, <p>Luxon was the first one to break the silence as his head turned to stare at the departing Julien.</p>, <p>He turned to look at Leon.</p>, <p>\"Didn't you say he wasn't going to do it? Was that just a lie? \"</p>, <p>\".....No.\"</p>, <p>Similarly confused, Leon's head turned to stare at Julien's back. Judging from his expression, he too seemed shocked by the situation.</p>, <p>Even though the situation turned out for the better...</p>, <p>'I don't like this.'</p>, <p>'Without meaning to, I got swept in his rhythm.'</p>, <p>Aoife was annoyed. Her neck heated and her hands tingled.</p>, <p>His mannerisms and the matter-of-fact tone he spoke with... It made it seem as though he was treating her as his servant.</p>, <p>'Why am I the one that is supposed to tell you?'</p>, <p>'You said you wanted to keep your role but demand others to tell you how to do that role...'</p>, <p>No, if you really wanted to do something, you'd already have done it by now.

Should we gather the leaders of the factions to talk to him?\"</p>, <p>Luxon asked tactlessly. Aoife secretly clenched her teeth and kept her expression firm.</p>, <p>\".....You figure that out amongst yourselves.\"</p>, <p>She then went on to leave on her own.</p>, <p>\"Eh? Aoife...! Where are you going?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Tak—</p>, <p>Aoife kept walking despite hearing her name getting called out repeatedly by Luxon.</p>, <p>'How laughable.'</p>, <p>The entire situation was.</p>, <p>She wanted his help.</p>, <p>....And yet.</p>, <p>When he offered his help, she found herself growing mad.</p>, <p>Hypocrisy?</p>, <p>Maybe...</p>, <p>But it also became clear to Aoife.</p>, <p>The entire reason she was acting this way.</p>, <p>She had thought she had managed to bury such emotions—weaknesses—deep within her mind, but...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She silently stared at her hand. It was trembling slightly.</p>, <p>The reality of the situation hit her and her face cracked.</p>, <p>\"Heh...\"</p>, <p>A laugh escaped.</p>, <p>\"...How ridiculous. Me of all people...\"</p>, <p>Indeed.</p>, <p>She was jealous.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was late into the night, and I was back in my room.</p>, <p>In this familiar environment, I sat down on the ground and stared at my hand. A beautiful purple magic circle hovered above the tips of my fingers.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>Even as sweat dripped from my head, I kept my gaze fixed on the circle in front of me.</p>, <p>\"I... really did it.\"</p>, <p>I still couldn't believe it.</p>, <p>The reality that was displayed in front of me.</p>, <p>I... could finally use my first true spell. Outside of Emotive Magic, this was my very first spell.</p>, <p>Ziiing—</p>, <p>I gently lifted my hand up, inserting it into the magic circle which slowly moved down. Gradually, my hand started to change, turning completely purple.</p>, <p>Just like last time, purple spots started to appear in my vision.</p>, <p>The furthest one was all the way toward the end of the living room. About fifteen meters away.</p>, <p>\"....Is that the limit of my range?\"</p>, <p>I moved back and the purple spot followed after.</p>, <p>\"Seems to be the case.\"</p>, <p>I pushed my hand forward and lightly tapped on the spot.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Tangible purple hands began to sprout from the ground. One... Two... Three... Four... There were a total of four. They rose from the ground and tried to latch on to whatever was on top of them.</p>, <p>This persisted for several seconds before the hands shattered.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>By the time the spell was done, I was on my last breath.</p>, <p>My mana reserves were almost depleted. I had been at it for quite a while so it was only natural that I was tired.</p>, <p>\"Five...\"</p>, <p>That was the amount of times I could use the spell before running out of mana.</p>, <p>My current limit.</p>, <p>\"Hooo...\"</p>, <p>I lay on the floor with my arms wide.</p>, <p>I was tired.</p>, <p>I was exhausted.</p>, <p>I was on my last breath.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Haha...\"</p>, <p>I think...</p>, <p>I was addicted.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>10:00 A.M. Karlson Hall.</p>, <p>The Karlson Hall was where the training grounds were located. The facility was extremely large, with over a thousand square meters of space, it was massive.</p>, <p>Today was an unusual class.</p>, <p>\"Progression Analysis. Every quarter we will examine the cadet's progression throughout the year. There will be three things measured in the test. First, mana quantity and quality. Second, physical fitness, and lastly, mind endurance.\"</p>, <p>The professor in charge, a tall woman with long blonde hair and green eyes, Olivia J. Kelson started to explain.</p>, <p>\"With the institute trying to ready you to enter the Mirror Dimension, it is important that we focus on all three aspects. Even if you are a mage, maintaining your body to a certain standard is necessary. In the chance that you find yourself in a situation where you can't defeat your opponent and are forced to run, your physical stamina will be an important factor.\"</p>, <p>She went on to talk about the importance of each testing point and how it would benefit us in the long term.</p>, <p>I carefully listened to each one of her words and made sure to take notes in my mind.</p>, <p>I was still a stranger to this world, and although what she was saying could be perceived as 'common sense'. Not all common sense applied to me.</p>, <p>There were certain things that I was unaware of.</p>, <p>\"I will now divide you into three groups. There, you will follow your assigned assistant to take on the testing.\"</p>, <p>Names started to get called out one by one.

He stood tall, towering over my figure, and his thick eyebrows were knit into a frown as he stared at me.</p>, <p>For some reason, I felt the impression that he didn't quite like me...</p>, <p>Was it just me?</p>, <p>'Maybe.'</p>, <p>It could just be that he just looked intimidating.</p>, <p>For now, under the watchful eyes of all the students and staff, I made my way toward my group. A couple of familiar faces entered my vision when I walked forward.</p>, <p>More specifically a girl with long white hair and red eyes.</p>, <p>I stared at her for a brief moment and as if she could sense my gaze, her head turned and our eyes met.</p>, <p>Immediately, her face turned to one of displeasure. Loathing almost.</p>, <p>'...I guess she still remembers the incident from before.'</p>, <p>The one regarding the cigarette.</p>, <p>Indeed, that was my fault. I shouldn't have acted like that.</p>, <p>\"Hurry along, we don't have all day to wait for you.\"</p>, <p>A rough voice directed itself toward me. When I looked up, I saw the assistant professor glaring at me from the distance.</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>This guy...</p>, <p>He really did hate me after all.</p>, <p>But why...?</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Knowing about the possible agenda against me, I kept my mouth shut and joined the group.</p>, <p>And as if I had some godly timing, the moment I joined the ground, the professor was done recounting all the names.</p>, <p>\"I'm done over here.\"</p>, <p>She looked toward the assistant professors and announced.</p>, <p>\"You may begin with the tests. Group one, please head toward the physical test. Group two, head for the mana test, and group three... Please proceed to the mental test.\"</p>, <p>We were group two which meant that our test was the mana test.</p>, <p>A part of me already dreaded the test knowing that my performance was going to be awful, but at the same time... I couldn't wait for the test.</p>, <p>What other people cared about me or whatnot. That was meaningless to me. What I cared about the most was seeing my current level.</p>, <p>Get a general idea of my overall level so that I could gauge the areas I needed to improve on.</p>, <p>\"Once everyone is done with the test, we'll alternate sections. Off you go.\"</p>, <p>These were the last words of the professor before we were led by our respective assistant professors toward our designated section.</p>, <p>The space was large.</p>, <p>About the size of a classroom.</p>, <p>In the space, a large magic circle was drawn on the ground where a large table sat and three orbs appeared.</p>, <p>\"This is the Mana Resonance Assessment.\"</p>, <p>The rough voice of the assistant professor began to spread.</p>, <p>\"The test is simple. There are three orbs on the table. Each orb has its own distinctive function.\"</p>, <p>He pointed toward the orbs.</p>, <p>\"The one on the left measures your mana quantity. The one in the middle measures your mana purity, and the one on the right measures your mana control. All you have to do is place your hand over the orb and channel your mana. A grade will be given to you after the test has ended.\"</p>, <p>Just as he said those words, his gaze fell on me.</p>, <p>I knew at that moment exactly what was about to happen. And he proved me right as he pointed toward the orbs.</p>, <p>\"Julien...\"</p>, <p>He called out my name, almost chewing on it.</p>, <p>\"You're first.\"</p>]\n",

I couldn't care less about whether he was targeting me or not.</p>, <p>.....All I cared about at the moment was my current progress and strength.</p>, <p>Where did I currently stand?</p>, <p>\"We will gauge your score from a scale of zero to ten. The number will represent your approximate range within the Tiers.\"</p>, <p>I didn't quite understand but I maintained my composure and walked forward, stopping right in front of the orb.</p>, <p>Hundreds of students stood behind me.</p>, <p>Their gazes pierced my back. They felt pressuring.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'I couldn't care less.'</p>, <p>I wasn't going to do well.</p>, <p>I knew that much.</p>, <p>Even so... I still was planning on doing my best.</p>, <p>The stares meant nothing to me. What I cared about was myself, and myself only.</p>, <p>\"You may start. Start with the first orb, the mana quantity measuring orb.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I nodded and placed my hand on the orb.</p>, <p>The moment I did, the assistant professor's rough voice echoed from behind.</p>, <p>\"Channel your mana into the orb.\"</p>, <p>I did as I was told.</p>, <p>Focusing my attention on my abdominal area, a familiar sensation coursed through my body, gathering toward my hand where it released and entered the orb.</p>, <p>A white light unfolded before my very eyes as my mana started to drain from my body.</p>, <p>I didn't resist it and let it flow out of my body.</p>, <p>'It's quite simple.'</p>, <p>All I did was channel my mana and direct it toward the orb.</p>, <p>The rest was straightforward.</p>, <p>This persisted for a few seconds before the light finally died down and the assistant professor's voice echoed from behind.</p>, <p>\"Score value; 1.716. Average.\"</p>, <p>Score value 1.716...? For some reason, the values felt familiar.</p>, <p>Recovering my breath, I thought closely to where I had seen those numbers before, when...</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>Something struck me.</p>, <p>'Status'</p>, <p>A screen floated in front of me. My eyes immediately darted toward the top spot where I finally saw it.</p>, <p>Level :17 [Tier 1 Magician]</p>, <p>Exp : [0%—[16%]100%]</p>, <p> 'Level 17 and 16%. Is that what it means by 1.716?'</p>, <p>My thoughts were interrupted by the rough voice of the Assistant Professor.</p>, <p>\"You're only 0.284 from reaching Tier 2.\"</p>, <p>He then went on to point toward the other orb.</p>, <p>\"You can start the mana purity test.\"</p>, <p>But I didn't move immediately.</p>, <p>I was busy musing over his words.</p>, <p>'Only 0.284 from reaching Tier 2... Does that mean that I'll reach Tier 2 at Level 20?'</p>, <p>If that were the case, would Tier 3 be level 30? Every ten levels a Tier?</p>, <p>Although I already had an idea about this, it was becoming clearer to me that it was probably true.</p>, <p>That said...</p>, <p>I was still not 100% sure.</p>, <p>I needed more time to observe the situation.</p>, <p>\"Cadet?\"</p>, <p>Hearing the Assistant Professor's not-so-pleased voice, I quietly nodded and moved toward the second orb.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>It looked the same as the first one and without needing anyone to tell me what to do, I placed my hand over the orb.</p>, <p>Yet again, the orb shone and mana drained from my body.</p>, <p>This lasted for several seconds before stopping.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A silence enveloped my surroundings before I finally turned my head to see the Assistant Professor staring at me with a frown.</p>, <p>I raised my brow.</p>, <p>'....Something wrong?'</p>, <p>\"Mana Purity; Tainted.\"</p>, <p>Tainted...?</p>, <p>What sort of score was this? I took a look around me and saw the expressions of the cadets around me. Some were whispering amongst each other while looking at me. I couldn't tell if they were making fun of me or not.</p>, <p>It very well could be given my position and score.</p>, <p>I accepted such criticism without flinching.</p>, <p>The Professor went on to explain.</p>, <p>\"Pristine, Pure, Refined, Standard, Tainted, Corrupted, and Void-touched.\"</p>, <p>He looked at the other cadets while he explained this.</p>, <p>\"Mana purity is judged based on one's ability to use mana. From speed, density, and elemental affinity. What we expect from you at the bare minimum is the Standard assessment.\"</p>, <p>As his voice grew deep, the Assistant Professor finally turned to look at me.</p>, <p>\"While not rare, tainted do occasionally show up. Our institute does our best to help such cadets out, but...\"</p>, <p>Finally, he displayed his disdain toward me for the first time.</p>, <p>\"I'm disappointed by the fact that our top cadet is one such cadet. Proceed toward the next orb.\"</p>, <p>The disdain was evident from his tone.</p>, <p>'.....What's this guy's problem?'</p>, <p>But even though he seemed to dislike me, he remained professional. Which was why I also remained quiet.</p>, <p>That and because fighting him wouldn't wield any positives for me.</p>, <p>\"...Was that really his score?\"</p>, <p>\"You heard it, right?\"</p>, <p>The whispers of the other cadets became even more prevalent but I ignored them and focused my attention on his words.</p>, <p>'So my mana is tainted... That makes sense.'</p>, <p>I had only been introduced to the concept of mana about two weeks ago.</p>, <p>Such a score made sense.</p>, <p>'I am no genius.'</p>, <p>My talent was average. That much became clear to me after learning the first spell.

Regardless of how improbable it was, to retain my sanity, I needed to cling to my goal.</p>, <p>Otherwise...</p>, <p>'I'll lose sight of myself.'</p>, <p>I went on to move toward the next orb.</p>, <p>\"This test will be a little different. Once you channel your mana inside of the orb, your goal is to control the mana threads and disperse them. The speed at which you're capable of doing this will determine your score.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Without looking back, I placed my hand on the orb. Unlike the previous times, the world around me turned dark.</p>, <p>'What's this?'</p>, <p>I was confused at first, but soon enough thousands of white threads appeared in the space in front of me.</p>, <p>I reached forward with my hand and grasped one of the threads, gently moving it to the side.</p>, <p>'Ah.'</p>, <p>That was when I recalled the Assistant Professor's words and understood.</p>, <p>'....I'm supposed to untangle this?'</p>, <p>I stared at the jungled-up mess in front of me.</p>, <p>Well, shit...</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"How long has it been...?\"</p>, <p>\"Why is he still there?\"</p>, <p>\"Did something go wrong?\"</p>, <p>Murmurs and whispers spread as all attention was focused on Julien who held his hand over the orb with his eyes closed. His back was straight, and his expression was calm.</p>, <p>His poise retained its usual dignity even under the intense scrutiny of those around him.</p>, <p>Eventually, his eyes came open to reveal his hazel pupils and he removed his hand from the orb.</p>, <p>\"The overall score is 0.4. You fail.\"</p>, <p>The Assistant Professor's voice ruthlessly came down as he announced the score. Almost instantly, the voices of the cadets became louder.</p>, <p>\"Failed?\"</p>, <p>\"0.4? Isn't that really low?\"</p>, <p>\"Is he doing this on purpose, or is he actually so weak?\"</p>, <p>\"Do you think I can beat him if I challenge him now?\"</p>, <p>Overhearing the discussion amongst the cadets, Kiera, shook her head and muttered,</p>, <p>\"....Idiots.\"</p>, <p>There weren't actually that many that were surprised by Julien's evaluation. It had been pretty obvious from the start that he wasn't very adept at using mana given his weak mana trace.</p>, <p>That said...</p>, <p>Those who knew didn't fault him for it.</p>, <p>'He's an Emotive Mage.'</p>, <p>One who wielded emotions. His proficiency over it was to a scary degree. Even now, Kiera could recall Julien's expression during the first lesson when he was called out by one of the cadets.</p>, <p>Who it was she didn't know.</p>, <p>Nor did she care.</p>, <p>But it didn't matter... She could still vividly recall what had happened afterward. The way he approached him, and how a single word from him made her skin crawl.</p>, <p>In her mind, he was no human.</p>, <p>'A crazy bastard.'</p>, <p>To study emotions to such an extent at such an age...</p>, <p>He could only be a crazy bastard.</p>, <p>She was therefore aware that whatever result he received today wouldn't reflect his true strength.</p>, <p>Many of those present were also aware of this with only a few thinking otherwise.</p>, <p>Arrogance, or stupidity?</p>, <p>'Maybe both.'</p>, <p>Either way, Kiera wasn't planning on defending him.</p>, <p>'Fucking asshole.'</p>, <p>Her impression of him was of the lowest. The scene at the library kept replaying in her mind as her expression crumbled.</p>, <p>'Just like that bitch... They're all the fucking same.'</p>, <p>Aoife K. Megrail.</p>, <p>Just the mention of her name made her face heat up as her teeth silently clenched together. One day... One day... She repeated to herself while staring ahead.</p>, <p>And then,</p>, <p>\"Kiera Mylne.\"</p>, <p>Her name was called up.</p>, <p>She didn't hesitate to move forward.

            "[<p>\"What do you think...? How are the results for this year?\"</p>, <p>Professor Kelson's voice echoed as she stood by the end of the training ground with her three other assistant professors.</p>, <p>The day was almost over, and so far each group had taken two of the three assessments they were supposed to take.</p>, <p>They were at the moment all taking a break. Be it professors or students.</p>, <p>\"...From my group, several students stand out.\"</p>, <p>One of the Assistant Professors, a young woman with short black hair commented.</p>, <p>She went on to say,</p>, <p>\"Evelyn from the Verlice family, and Luxon from the Ravenscroft family. They scored quite high on the Mana examination test, with 2.58 and 2.31 respectively. They've also scored quite highly on the Mental examination test, with a score of 2.01 and 2.11 respectively... Their results already surpass that of the top cadets of last year's batch.\"</p>, <p>\"Hmmm.\"</p>, <p>Professor Kelson quietly nodded while listening to the report. Indeed, the results were quite frightening.</p>, <p>For first-year cadets to reach a score above 2 was quite rare. That signified that the cadet was already in the Tier 2 range.</p>, <p>Such feat was extremely rare and only occasionally would the academy be blessed with such individuals.</p>, <p>For two to appear...</p>, <p>\"I'd like to add to that.\"</p>, <p>A tall man with long black hair and a skinny frame displayed his clipboard.</p>, <p>\"Actually... It's about my group.\"</p>, <p>His expression was quite serious.</p>, <p>\"My group took part in the Physical and Mental examination. Two students stood out in my group as well. It's just that...\"</p>, <p>He took a short pause while looking at the clipboard in his hand. Scratching the back of his head, his face scrunched up in what appeared to be disbelief.</p>, <p>\"I really can't believe we had such monsters in our year... Leon Ellert. Physical examination score, 2.91. Mental examination score, 2.98. Aoife Megrail. Physical examination score, 2.87.

Did you just...\"</p>, <p>\"Leon Ellert. Physical examination score, 2.91. Mental examination score, 2.98. Aoife Megrail. Physical examination score, 2.87.

Any notable figures from your group?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>His deep voice quietly echoed out in the group.</p>, <p> Taking out his clipboard, he frowned.</p>, <p>\".....Only one though.\"</p>, <p>Whether he spoke out of disappointment or not, nobody could be sure. His expression was hard to read.</p>, <p>He began to announce,</p>, <p>\"Kiera Mylne. Mana examination test, 2.504. Physical examination test, 2.281.\"</p>, <p>\"Another monster...\"</p>, <p>\"Wow.\"</p>, <p>The other assistant professors seemed impressed by her performance. All but Professor Kelson who saw the crux of the problem.</p>, <p>\"The Black Star...\"</p>, <p>She began to speak,</p>, <p>\"Wasn't he in your group? What was his result?\"</p>, <p>\"That's what I want to talk about...\"</p>, <p>Finally, a shift occurred in Gilbert's expression as it darkened.</p>, <p>\"Julien Evenus. Mana examination test, 1.716. Physical examination test, 1.189.\"</p>, <p>Gilbert's grip on the board tightened.</p>, <p>\"....He's currently ranked amongst the last in my group in terms of average. An embarrassment.\"</p>, <p>The utter disregard in his tone couldn't be hidden. Although he tried his best to keep himself from displaying such emotion, it was starting to become hard when confronted with such results.</p>, <p>'He is not fit to be the Black Star.'</p>, <p>That was the only thought that ran through his mind.</p>, <p>\"Those are indeed quite low scores.\"</p>, <p>The Professor couldn't deny it. Her gaze turned toward the distance where a particular figure appeared. He easily stood out from the rest of the students. Just his appearance was enough to warrant that.</p>, <p>But there was also the fact that he stood alone, with the cadets actively avoiding him.</p>, <p>It was hard for her to not spot him under such circumstances.</p>, <p>She rubbed her forehead.</p>, <p>\"For now, we can do nothing about this. Let's proceed with the next examination. I'd like to go home early. Who knows, he might do a little better in the next examination.\"</p>, <p>\"...I doubt that.\"</p>, <p>Gilbert went on to put his clipboard under his armpit and headed back for his group. The last examination was the mental test. Of all the other examinations, it was the hardest one to score a high grade on.</p>, <p>He doubted Julien could do well in such an examination given how miserably he had performed in the other examinations.</p>, <p>As he walked, he shook his head.</p>, <p>'...Pathetic.'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Word of Julien's score started to spread amongst the first-year cadets. Many showed surprised looks while others didn't seem as surprised.</p>, <p>\"Did you hear about Julien's score...?\"</p>, <p>\"I did.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...\"</p>, <p>\"Nothing surprising.\"</p>, <p>Leon stretched his muscles while secretly channeling the mana in his body. His next test was up. The mana examination one. He planned on doing well in that one too.</p>, <p>\"What's up with your reaction? Why do you seem so unsurprised?\"</p>, <p>\"Because I'm not.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, Leon turned his head and looked at Evelyn. She was constantly alternating her head between him and Julien.</p>, <p>\"At this rate won't he get in trouble? As his knight, won't that affect you?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>When she put it like that...</p>, <p>\"I'll be fine.\"</p>, <p>Thinking about it, there was no need for him to worry.</p>, <p>\"He'll also be fine.\"</p>, <p>\"But...\"</p>, <p>\"I wouldn't be as relaxed as you are.\"</p>, <p>A voice suddenly interrupted. When Leon turned his head, he saw Aoife approaching their direction.</p>, <p>Her gaze similarly fell on Julien who was standing by himself in the distance.</p>, <p>\"He managed to deter people from approaching him during the first lecture thanks to his performance. However, now that the results are out... How long do you think before someone challenges him?\"</p>, <p>\"....I'm not sure.\"</p>, <p>Leon truthfully answered.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Aoife blankly stared at Leon for a few seconds and shook her head while silently muttering in a low voice, 'Are you really his knight?' before steading her expression again.</p>, <p>\"You're forgetting that we currently need him. I won't be able to take his title away until the Mid-terms. In that case, he needs to make sure he retains his image.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Leon quietly listened to Aoife speak as he kept his gaze locked on her. She seemed rather adamant about taking his spot when the mid-terms came.</p>, <p>He couldn't exactly put that against her.</p>, <p>The title of the 'Black Star' carried a lot of significance. Be it within the institute, and politically.</p>, <p>\".....He's still fine because of what he pulled during the first day and the fact that the institute wouldn't grant someone the title without merit. However, at this rate, people will start forgetting this.\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned while gently brushing her red locks behind her ears.</p>, <p>\"There's a high chance he won't be able to perform well in his last test. I suggest you prepare yourself for the after-effects. It won't be big, but you'll need to be ready for it.\"</p>, <p>She paused and turned to look at Leon.</p>, <p>\".....Because you'll also be at the center of it. As his knight.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>After a short break, we were led toward a strange device that sat in the middle of the training grounds. From where I was, I could still see the other groups readying themselves for the upcoming examinations.</p>, <p>In the end, my results ended up being subpar.</p>, <p>The way some of the cadets looked at me changed as my results spread. While none of them still seemed keen on targeting me, I could feel some of the bolder cadets entertaining the idea.</p>, <p>'How troublesome.'</p>, <p>It was indeed getting troublesome, but it was still manageable.</p>, <p>I wasn't afraid of getting challenged. In fact, I more than entertained the idea.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'I wonder if my current self is capable of even putting up a performance...?'</p>, <p>The only thing I had was Emotive Magic and a single spell that I could hardly use. It was quite obvious to me that I would end up losing pathetically.</p>, <p>Even so...</p>, <p>A part of me really wanted to fight. Not because I didn't care about losing, but because I knew it was the fastest way to grow.</p>, <p>\"The Mental Examination can be said to be the hardest test yet. It won't be testing your mana or your physical abilities, but the firmness of your mind. To be able to withstand pain under critical situations, to be able to remain composed under serious situations...\"</p>, <p>The assistant professor began to introduce us to the examination.</p>, <p>\"This is one of the most important assessments you will face so make sure you try your best.\"</p>, <p>He then proceeded to point at the device that stood behind him. At a glance, it seemed to be a regular chair.</p>, <p>No, maybe it was...</p>, <p>\"The test is simple.\"</p>, <p>The assistant professor took out a small metallic black bracelet from his pocket.</p>, <p>\"This is the device that we will use for the examination. It overloads your sensory systems with all sorts of feelings. But primarily, it will give you pain. Your main job is to withstand the pain for as long as you can without screaming or passing out. The more time passes, the greater the pain.\"</p>, <p>Searching around with his eyes, his gaze eventually fell on a particular figure. One with long white hair and red eyes.</p>, <p>\"Kiera, you will be the one to try it first.\"</p>, <p>'Haa... This...'</p>, <p>I wanted to laugh at the situation. The order until now had always been the same. Me first, then Kiera, and so on...</p>, <p>The reason why he hadn't called my name was fairly obvious.</p>, <p>I wasn't the only one who noticed. The other cadets noticed too as they threw second glances my way.</p>, <p>I kept my expression firm while staring ahead.</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>Kiera walked up to the chair and sat down.</p>, <p>\"Put this on.\"</p>, <p>Taking the bracelet, she put it on her wrist as it latched itself onto it. She didn't seem at all nervous and leaned back on the chair.</p>, <p>On the other hand, the assistant professor took out a small device from his pocket. A stopwatch of some sort, and pressed on the top end.</p>, <p>\"Let's begin.\"</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>Her body jolted immediately after the assistant professor's voice fell. Her eyes shot open while the bracelet in her hand trembled.</p>, <p>\"Akh... ukh...!\"</p>, <p>Her struggle wasn't as pronounced at first. However, with the passing of the seconds, her body started to tremble with more intensity.</p>, <p>\"Don't scream. If you scream, you fail.\"</p>, <p>The assistant professor's cold voice served to remind her to keep herself composed.</p>, <p>\"0.1\"</p>, <p>\"0.2\"</p>, <p>\"0.3\"</p>, <p>As well as recounting her score.</p>, <p>\"0.8\"</p>, <p>\"0.9\"</p>, <p>\"1.0\"</p>, <p>\"Akh...!\"</p>, <p>The moment the count hit 1.0, the pain seemed to escalate to a different level as Kiera's body spasmed with even more force.</p>, <p>Even so, she kept herself from screaming.</p>, <p>The surroundings were quiet as all eyes were fixed on her.</p>, <p>\"1.7\"</p>, <p>\"1.8\"</p>, <p>\"1.9\"</p>, <p>\"2.0\"</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>Her body jolted and her head smacked back. Her entire body spasmed, and for the briefest moment, she almost screamed.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>With some absurd level of willpower, she was able to keep herself from screaming.</p>, <p>Kata! Kata! Kata!</p>, <p>The chair rattled with force asnd her body continued to trash around.</p>, <p>\"2.1\"</p>, <p>\"2.2\"</p>, <p>The count continued.</p>, <p>Her legs flayed in random directions.</p>, <p>\"Akh...!

It was almost impressive.</p>, <p>But that eventually came to an end...</p>, <p>\".....Akhhhhhhhhhh!\"</p>, <p>Her scream ended up piercing through her silence as her body started to spasm uncontrollably.</p>, <p>Click--!</p>, <p>A gentle click sounded that moment and her body finally relaxed.</p>, <p>Only when she fully calmed down and was capable of moving her body again did the assistant professor announce her result.</p>, <p>\"Kiera Mylne.

It was unheard of. Not here, nor in the other Empires.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>Here she was, staring at such unbelievable results.</p>, <p>\"Anger. Sadness.

            "[<p>News about Julien's achievements at Haven quickly reached the Evenus household near Westernborn, one of the two regions under the Evenus Barony management.</p>, <p>\".....This doesn't make sense.\"</p>, <p>Aldric M. Evenus muttered while staring at the files in front of him.</p>, <p>It had been a while since he had heard the news of his son becoming the Black Star, and even now, he had trouble believing the news.</p>, <p>Was this really his son...?</p>, <p>Though not incompetent, he was also not this competent.</p>, <p>And as he read through the new report, his brows further furrowed.</p>, <p>\"It's not adding up.\"</p>, <p>If it were not for the fact that Leon personally said that this was Julien, he would've believed there was something wrong with Julien.</p>, <p>To Tok--</p>, <p>A figure entered after knocking. It was a young man with brown hair and hazel eyes. His expression was clean, and his face held perfect symmetries. By any right, he was a handsome man.</p>, <p>\"Father.\"</p>, <p>He addressed politely as he entered.</p>, <p>\"....Linus.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Linus lowered his head in acknowledgment. He was the second son of the Evenus Household and the next one in line for the position.</p>, <p>Unlike Julien, he had a warmer disposition and seemed more approachable.</p>, <p>\"Have you noticed anything strange with your brother before he left for the institute?\"</p>, <p>\"...Hm? Brother? Did something happen?\"</p>, <p>\"Check this out.\"</p>, <p>Aldric slid the papers over his desk. Though confused, Linus walked toward the desk and checked out the papers.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>Gradually, his expression strained. He put the paper down and looked up.</p>, <p>\".....Is this real?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Aldric nodded.</p>, <p>\"I haven't told you yet because I found it hard to believe myself. Leon has confirmed everything.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, is that so...\"</p>, <p>Linus casually glanced at the documents one more time before nodding.</p>, <p>\"If Leon said so, then there's nothing to worry about.\"</p>, <p>His expression seemed genuine. With a sigh, Aldric drummed his fingers over the wooden desk. Then, as he casually glanced up at Linus who was staring at the documents with a strange intensity, he waved his hand.</p>, <p>\"You may go.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm...? Now?\"</p>, <p>Linus appeared surprised by the sudden dismissal.</p>, <p>Aldric didn't look up and sat down on his chair.</p>, <p> \"I just wanted to double-check on you. Since we agree, I'll wait for Julien to return after the mid-terms to confirm.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah... I see.\"</p>, <p>Though reluctant, Linus didn't argue and nodded his head in understanding. Then, with a short bow, he left the room.</p>, <p>Clank--!</p>, <p>A large corridor met Linus's sight as he came out. It was wide but empty.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>The sound of his steps echoed rhythmically as he calmly headed toward his room which was located on the second floor of the Evenus estate.</p>, <p>Upon entering his room, he closed the door behind him and headed toward his desk where he poured himself a drink.</p>, <p>Gulp.</p>, <p>The burn lingered in his throat as he relished the drink.</p>, <p>The glass emptied and the pain at the back of his throat eased, cooling his head in the process. Taking a deep breath, he sat on his sofa while muttering a name.</p>, <p>\"...Julien.\"</p>, <p>It was the name of his older brother.</p>, <p>His grip on the glass tightened, and his expression distorted.</p>, <p>\"Have you finally decided to reveal your true self...?\"</p>, <p>An image floated in his mind.</p>, <p>One of a specific individual. Staring down at him with a cold gaze while his house burned, and everyone he cared about died.</p>, <p>\"Fucking bastard...\"</p>, <p>He quietly spat through his teeth as his hold of the cup intensified.</p>, <p>Others may not know, but he knew.</p>, <p>His nightmares told him...</p>, <p>Julien.</p>, <p>His brother.</p>, <p>He was a monster waiting to destroy everything they had.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>There weren't many things that I could do now that I was injured. Training was apparently off the list, but I refused to believe there was no way for me to train without the assistance of my body.</p>, <p>It was why I was now back in the library.</p>, <p>\"What kind of nonsense is this...\"</p>, <p>There were still many questions that I had regarding the English sections, and how the books were here. Presumingly, this world was a game. It wouldn't be strange for there to be English in this world if that was the reason why English was present.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>'What if this world isn't a game...?'</p>, <p>Perhaps it was because everything felt so real, but there was something that nagged at the back of my mind. What if...? What if....?</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>My head throbbed at the idea.</p>, <p>It was crazy thoughts, but my mind couldn't help but wander there on the occasion. Unfortunately, there was also something that became more clear to me the more I had these thoughts.</p>, <p>And it was that...</p>, <p>\"I still know too little.\"</p>, <p>The Mirror Dimension, this Empire, the other Empires, and its history. If I couldn't train with my body, then there was no reason for me to waste time doing nothing but learning.</p>, <p>'I might just find the answers I wanted here... And also a way to train without straining my body.'</p>, <p>Which was exactly what I was doing.</p>, <p>\"Let's see....\"</p>, <p>I looked around me, scanning all the books that were carefully lined up on the bookshelves. From magic theory to history, I picked up book after book.</p>, <p>There were also several interesting ones from the English section that I took.</p>, <p>By the time I was done, I had gathered over a dozen books.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Managing to find a very secluded area of the library, I set the books down and sat down on the chair.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>The books were quite thick and they numbered a lot, but...</p>, <p>\"I have to do this.\"</p>, <p>Knowledge was important.</p>, <p>Even though I was reluctant to do this, I had no choice but to.</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, I began to open the first book.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right...\"</p>, <p>But just as I did, I recalled something and took out a pair of glasses from my pocket. It was something the doctor had given me.</p>, <p>The damage my eyes sustained was quite serious.</p>, <p>To the point where I had no choice but to put up with wearing glasses whenever I needed to read.</p>, <p>\"How odd...\"</p>, <p>They felt weird, finding myself squinting a couple of times. I wasn't sure I'd ever get used to this, but since it was temporary, I ignored the discomfort and began reading.</p>, <p>I had been through worse.</p>, <p>Flip--</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>There were a few things that Aoife kept secret from the world. Hardly anyone knew this about her, and she never planned on anyone finding out about it.</p>, <p>And that was...</p>, <p>\"Ba dum~ Ta tum~ Lalala~\"</p>, <p>She liked to sing when there was no one around her.</p>, <p>\"Ba dum~ Ta tum~\"</p>, <p>Such was how she was when she didn't have to pretend to be perfect. Flaws weren't something that the Megrail family accepted. At least, not on the outside.</p>, <p>\"Ba dam~\"</p>, <p>Her feet stopped and her gaze fell on the rows of books in front of her.</p>, <p>She was currently in the library.</p>, <p>It may have only been the second week of the institute, but for a top student like her, working outside of lessons was extremely important.</p>, <p>How else would she be able to become the Black Star?</p>, <p>Ever since entering the institute, it had always been her goal to snatch the position away from Julien. She was of royal descent, and the fact that she wasn't first, despite all her advantages made her strive to work harder.</p>, <p>She could accept there being more talented people than her.</p>, <p>What she couldn't accept was losing out to them when she had such clear advantages. It gave her a sour taste in her mouth.</p>, <p>As if the world was telling her she wasn't doing enough.</p>, <p>That she... wasn't enough.</p>, <p>\"Mhmmm~\"</p>, <p>There was also another thing that she really liked about the library.</p>, <p>It was that there was hardly anyone that was there.</p>, <p>She could sing freely without any problems. Well, to a moderate level. There was a chance that a cadet might be hiding somewhere, but she could just silence them if need be.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She scanned around and looked around the bookshelves.</p>, <p>[Magic Theory]</p>, <p>[Combat Theory]</p>, <p>[English]</p>, <p>She collected all sorts of books. There were many classes that she attended, and it was therefore important that she kept up with all of them.</p>, <p>Aoife even went as far as taking some books for classes that would be taught from the next semester onward.</p>, <p>She was that dedicated.</p>, <p>\"Hmm~\"</p>, <p>The pile was slowly starting to increase. One book, two books, three books...</p>, <p>It didn't matter how many books she had. Unlike the other cadets, she could check out as many as she wanted.</p>, <p>After all, the Vice-Chancellor was her cousin.</p>, <p>\"Ta da~\"</p>, <p>All was going well.</p>, <p>Aoife had never been in such a great mood. So much so that she even found herself hopping in a light dance.</p>, <p>To! To!</p>, <p>But that all stopped after a certain point.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her steps ceased and her expression stiffened.</p>, <p>A face she least wanted to see. He wore a set of unfamiliar dark-framed glasses. Strangely, coupled with his dark blazer, and undervest, it suited him. His hazel eyes beneath the glasses held a peculiar allure, compelling one to gaze into them.</p>, <p>Standing before her was the last person she wanted to see.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her mouth opened, but no words came out.</p>, <p>Seconds passed, and all she could do was open her mouth like a fool, trying to find an excuse, something... to justify her actions... to... to... but....</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Nothing.</p>, <p>Her mind was blank.</p>, <p>Flip--</p>, <p>Her thoughts were rattled by the sound of a singular page being flipped. When she looked up, she saw Julien staring at his book with his usual indifferent expression.</p>, <p>It was as if he wasn't bothered at all by her antics.</p>, <p>\"Huuu...\"</p>, <p>Aoife wasn't sure why, but she felt herself sigh in relief at the thought.</p>, <p>'Maybe he didn't see...'</p>, <p>Yeah, that could be it.</p>, <p>He must've missed it.</p>, <p>Pursing her lips, she turned around and prepared to head back, when...</p>, <p>\"Singing...\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Julien's cold voice reached her ears, causing her to involuntarily flinch.</p>, <p>\"...Do it somewhere else next time.

I personally don't think it's sad, but I feel the need to put this here for those who are more sensitive.]</p>, <p>Aoife felt a strange heat rise in her face as she rigidly stood with her back faced against him. It started to spread through every corner of her body.</p>, <p>She felt her face was currently the same color as her hair.</p>, <p>The thought made her face stiff.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>In the silence that took hold of the surroundings, Aoife pursed her lips.</p>, <p>'This bastard... Did he just...?'</p>, <p>What replaced the shame that she was feeling was another feeling. Anger. Yes, she was angry.</p>, <p>Of all things...</p>, <p>Her fists slowly clenched, and so did her teeth.</p>, <p>\"Huuu...\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, she suppressed the rage that was boiling within her. She was afraid she'd do something stupid otherwise.</p>, <p>Then....</p>, <p>While still holding onto her books, she turned back to face him and headed toward the same desk he was on.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>And placed her books on his table.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>He stared at her with a look that seemed to say, 'Have you lost it?' but Aoife ignored it and proceeded to sit.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>\"Ba Dum~ Ta la~\"</p>, <p>She proceeded to sing.</p>, <p>It was now his turn to flinch. Only that, Aoife felt her heart squeeze at his reaction. Her singing... It couldn't be that bad, right?</p>, <p>For some reason that hurt more than she thought.</p>, <p>'No, it's him.'</p>, <p>Yeah, it had to be.</p>, <p>She was a great singer.</p>, <p>\"Tu lum~\"</p>, <p>\".....What are you doing?\"</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>It was her turn to ignore him. Casually looking at the book in front of her, she continued to hum.</p>, <p>That was until his hand came pressing down against her book.</p>, <p>She looked up.</p>, <p>\"What.\"</p>, <p>\"....Can you stop?\"</p>, <p> \"Why? This is a public space.\"</p>, <p>\"I'd like to study, not lose my hearing.\"</p>, <p>\"I... you...\"</p>, <p>Aoife clenched her teeth while struggling to retort. She then whispered, \"...It's not that bad.\"</p>, <p>\"It is.</p>, <p>His fast reply felt like a hammer to Aoife who found herself unable to retort back. Rage boiled within her, but she didn't show it as she kept her face firm.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>'.....What am I even doing?'</p>, <p>Aoife was stumped. She wanted to leave, but couldn't. Now that she sat down, she needed to sit there for at least five minutes before leaving.</p>, <p>'I was too impulsive.'</p>, <p>Now, she had to pay the consequences of her actions.</p>, <p>Or so she thought.</p>, <p>Creaaak...</p>, <p>Julien's chair scraped as he stood up. Their eyes met for a brief moment before he scanned the books and selected a few.</p>, <p>\"....Are you leaving?\"</p>, <p>Aoife felt compelled to ask. If so, then she didn't have to leave.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>He didn't reply to her. It was as if he wasn't even listening to her. Aoife's lips opened. For the first time in a while, she was unsure of what to do. She felt a strange sense of humiliation in this entire ordeal as her face flushed a further shade of red.</p>, <p>Her gaze eventually fell on one of the many books he left on the table and she didn't hesitate to take it.</p>, <p>\"Since that's the case, you won't mind me taking this, right?\"</p>, <p>Tok Tok.</p>, <p>Julien's calm footsteps echoed as he headed out for the library.</p>, <p>His back had always been turned on her. The utter disregard he had for her had Aoife's gears further, and just as she opened her mouth to say something again, he pointed at his ear.</p>, <p>\"....Can't hear.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It may have seemed like I was exaggerating, but I genuinely was hurting in my ears. What sort of singing was that...?</p>, <p>It felt as though someone was scraping a window with their nails.</p>, <p>Goosebumps.</p>, <p>All I felt were goosebumps.</p>, <p>'It's a bit of a pity for that book that I left, but I can't focus with her here.'</p>, <p>There was one book I really wanted to read but unfortunately couldn't.

Then blinked again. Then turned around and prepared to head out.</p>, <p>\"You don't have to clean this up. I'll do it... Later.\"</p>, <p>I stopped dead in my tracks and turned around. Ignoring all the wrappers and papers on the floor, I headed back into the office space.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Delilah just stared at me with a blank look, but I ignored her. She also didn't pursue the matter and continued.</p>, <p>\"How many spells do you know?\"</p>, <p>Spells?</p>, <p>I counted in my head.</p>, <p>If we counted the six basic emotions, there were only two.</p>, <p>\"Eight.\"</p>, <p>\"Eight? Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Delilah frowned.</p>, <p>\"I assume six of them are the six basic emotions, correct?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>With a quiet nod, she leaned back on her chair and crossed her arms. She then proceeded to ask,</p>, <p>\"How far have you learned?\"</p>, <p>\"Both beginner. I have only unlocked one.\"</p>, <p>Hands of Malady was currently the only spell I could use at that moment. I still couldn't use the other spell.</p>, <p>There were five stages to a spell.</p>, <p>Unlocking, which was the integration of a circle in the mind. Only when a circle connection was established with the mind would one be able to use the spell as wanted.</p>, <p>It was usually the hardest part of learning a spell.</p>, <p>The next five ranks were—beginner, intermediate, advanced, superior, and perfected.</p>, <p>\".....Any intermediate?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes. Sadness.\"</p>, <p>Currently, only sadness was intermediate for me.</p>, <p>It was the one I understood the best, and it was also the one that hurt the most.</p>, <p>So...</p>, <p>\"Try it on me.\"</p>, <p>I felt a little reluctant when she asked me. But I understood that this was important and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>\"Now....?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes, I need to know the extent of your skills before helping you.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Briefly, I glanced at my forearm before taking my gaze away from it.</p>, <p>I needed to evoke sadness.</p>, <p>The wheel couldn't guarantee such emotion. And...</p>, <p>'I want to see how deep my powers are.'</p>, <p>Could they affect someone as powerful as her?</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>The thought boiled in my mind and I took another deep breath before closing my eyes. I let my mind sink into my thoughts.</p>, <p>I was going to give it my all. Without the immersion. Without cheating. Just me, and my thoughts.</p>, <p>And for me to do that...</p>, <p>I needed to unseal memories I had kept hidden in my mind.</p>, <p>\"H-huu...\"</p>, <p>A certain pain pierced my heart. It stabbed at it like a sharp knife and I felt my chest tighten.</p>, <p>An image conjured in my mind.</p>, <p>My lips... They felt dry all of a sudden. My fingers felt restless, and my lungs started to heat with every breath.</p>, <p>A familiar sensation.</p>, <p>....And a familiar smell.</p>, <p>Earthy, pungent, with a touch of sweet notes.</p>, <p>Haa... This was...</p>, <p>Tzzz—</p>, <p>The sound it made with each drag.</p>, <p>The calmness it brought.</p>, <p>The taste in my lips.</p>, <p>I recalled everything. To the little detail. As if it were yesterday.</p>, <p>Even the conversation that came along with that feeling.</p>, <p>'....Why did you start smoking?'</p>, <p>Who was it that asked me that question...? My mind was fuzzy. My surroundings were gray, and the figure's face felt faint.</p>, <p>I couldn't recall much besides the conversation.</p>, <p>But even now...</p>, <p>I remembered my answer.</p>, <p>'There was a time when I wanted to get cancer.'</p>, <p>My cheeks twitched.

Even as I put everything in it, she remained expressionless and unfazed.</p>, <p>It was a bit disappointing but understandable.</p>, <p>She was the closest to the Zenith. For her to be unaffected by me didn't come to me as a surprise. Disappointing, but expected.</p>, <p>'I wonder when I will be able to affect someone like her...'</p>, <p>Emotions could affect anyone regardless of their tier and strength. That much I was aware of. Unfortunately, the stronger one was, the more powerful their mind was.</p>, <p>It became a lot harder to affect the emotions of someone like that.</p>, <p>And the fact that she seemed unguarded when I used my spell and was still unaffected spoke volumes of her mental resistance.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>The reality of my situation became more glaring to me.</p>, <p>I still had a long way to go.</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>In the two weeks that I had been at the institute, I had never really paid any particular attention to my surroundings.</p>, <p>It was with such thoughts that I looked at my surroundings for once. It was beautiful. The place looked stunning with greenery everywhere and intricately designed buildings that seemed unfit for this 'setting'.</p>, <p>Cadets walked around the campus talking with one another and enjoying their life.</p>, <p>There was also a strange scene in the distance. A middle-aged man with a thick mustache and round glasses sat by a stone stool, playing checkers alone.</p>, <p>\"What sort of...\"</p>, <p>Yes. He was alone, but...</p>, <p>He still seemed to be having fun.</p>, <p>.....I felt a little envious staring at the scene.</p>, <p>Had my circumstances been a bit different, perhaps I would've enjoyed my time here more thoroughly, but...</p>, <p>'I can't.'</p>, <p>There were things that I needed to prioritize.</p>, <p>I needed to remain consistent with my mindset.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>As I walked the campus, I suddenly paused. In the distance, a particular scene caught my attention. Four cadets were circling over a single person.</p>, <p>'It's her...'</p>, <p>I recognized her in an instant.</p>, <p>With her platinum long hair, sour expression, and red eyes, she easily stood out.</p>, <p>It was one of the top-ranked cadets.</p>, <p>Kiera Mylne.</p>, <p>'Why is she...?'</p>, <p> ***</p>, <p>\"Think about our offer. If you join us, we'll be able to have more power over the first year. You'll be able to do whatever you want... Even smoke.\"</p>, <p>The offer seemed rather tempting.</p>, <p>Smoking... Smoking...</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Yeah.</p>, <p>\"....I'll have to decline.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>\"What do you...?\"</p>, <p>Kiera rummaged through her pockets and took out a cigarette which she quickly lit up with her finger.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>She then proceeded to blow the smoke toward the four people surrounding her.</p>, <p>\"Akh!\"</p>, <p>\"What are you....!\"</p>, <p>Kiera smirked as she looked at their faces.</p>, <p>\"I can smoke regardless. The fuck do I care about joining a faction? It's bothersome.\"</p>, <p>They had been pestering for the past week or so. Something about joining their faction. Each time she refused them. However, their persistence never ceased. It was starting to get on her nerves.</p>, <p>\"If you have nothing else better to do, why don't you do something more productive like breathing water? Trust me. You'll do me a service.\"</p>, <p>The faces of the four cadets surrounding her flushed. They seemed unsure of what to say which Kiera found hilarious as she smacked her thigh.</p>, <p>\"Pfttt, you should take a look at your expressions. Fucking ridiculous.\"</p>, <p>And proceeded to laugh to herself.</p>, <p>\"Kakaka.\"</p>, <p>Only that... Her laugh wasn't the most pleasing to the ears. Eventually, though, the four cadets snapped out of it.</p>, <p>A tall cadet with blonde hair cut in a bowl cut, and sunken cheeks stepped forward. He frowned while looking at Kiera.</p>, <p>It was obvious from their body language that they were all wary of her. It was probably why they hadn't resorted to any violence or threats.</p>, <p>\".....I'll ask again, do you want to join our faction or not? It will be very beneficial for you in the long run. We'll make you the Vice-Leader if you want to. Anders is adamant about wanting you in our group. If you say the wo—\"</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>Smoke blew on his face, forcing him to halt mid-sentence.</p>, <p>When he looked up, he saw a middle finger pointed at his face.</p>, <p>\"Kindly... Fuck off.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>The cadet opened his mouth and then closed it as his teeth ground together.</p>, <p>\"Do yo—\"</p>, <p>\"You there.\"</p>, <p>A cold voice pierced through the surroundings as all heads turned.</p>, <p>\"Who...!\"</p>, <p>The expressions of all present stiffened at the sight of the figure headed their way. A mere glance into his eyes compelled them to avert their gaze, finding the intensity within them too overwhelming.</p>, <p>With his well-maintained uniform and intimidating expression, the four cadets struggled to keep themselves composed.</p>, <p>He was someone an enigma and someone nobody wanted to associate with.</p>, <p>Tok.</p>, <p>He stood tall in front of the cadet. His gaze lowered to meet his eyes.</p>, <p>\"....Are you the ones I've been hearing about?\"</p>, <p>Even his voice sounded intimidating.</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>\"That faction thing.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>The cadet secretly gulped. He found it hard to remain composed under Julien's intense gaze.</p>, <p>He was still able to force a small nod.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\".....I see.\"</p>, <p>Julien calmly closed his eyes before muttering.</p>, <p>\"Your leader, or whoever is in charge...\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>All four cadets looked at Julien with wide-open eyes. He cared nothing for the gaze as he flatly continued.</p>, <p>\"Get him to meet me tomorrow.\"</p>, <p>His words...</p>, <p>They seemed more like a command than a request.</p>, <p>\"I'll talk with him tomorrow.\"</p>, <p>It was as if they had no right to refuse. And it was the intensity at which he looked at them that made them unable to refute. Forcing them to quietly nod before leaving.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Only once they left did silence fall on the surroundings.</p>, <p>Kiera, who had been watching the entire time, frowned and blew her smoke away.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>\"What was that for? Were you trying to help me or something?\"</p>, <p>Julien turned his head and their eyes met.</p>, <p>'It's that expression again...'</p>, <p>The one filled with nothing but pity as he looked at her. Kiera silently clenched her teeth. Why are you looking at me like that...? Just as she was about to say something, he beat her to it.</p>, <p>\"I didn't do it for you.\"</p>, <p>Julien said, his voice sounding rather quiet.</p>, <p>\".....I'm just taking responsibility for once. I'd rather handle it now than wait before it gets harder to handle.\"</p>, <p>He glanced at her once again, his eyes falling on the cigarette in her hand.</p>, <p>Kiera frowned, expecting him to do something similar to last time.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>But....</p>, <p>\"Stop smoking.\"</p>, <p>Much to her surprise, he didn't pursue the matter and turned around to leave.</p>, <p>\".....It isn't good for you.\"</p>, <p>His back slowly faded from her sight.</p>, <p>Staring at it, Kiera looked at her hand where the cigarette was and mumbled,</p>, <p>\"You think I don't know?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was nighttime by the time Aoife was done with her outing at the library. She normally wouldn't have spent such a long time there, but thinking back at the situation from before, she had no choice but to stay there.</p>, <p>.....Had she left in her previous mood, she was afraid she'd kill someone by accident.</p>, <p>The moon hung in the night sky, illuminating the world beneath.</p>, <p>Lost in her thoughts, Aoife followed the path back to the dorm. It was a beautiful path.</p>, <p>The cobblestone path was embraced by all sorts of flowers as a gentle breeze gracefully swept through the air.</p>, <p>It felt strangely nice.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>And then, a figure appeared in the distance. They seemed to be all sweaty, and haggard.</p>, <p>\"Leon...?\"</p>, <p>His identity became clear as he stopped under the light from a lampost. How could it not when his appearance stood out so much?</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>He turned his head, finally noticing her.</p>, <p>\"Aoife?\"</p>, <p>\"....Are you coming back from training?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded his head. Then, lowering his head and focusing his gaze on the books in her hand, he tilted his head.</p>, <p>\"Library?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"So late?\"</p>, <p>\"Could ask the same of you.\"</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Leon scratched the side of his head. Glancing at the books, he hesitantly asked.</p>, <p>\"Do you need help?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>A flat-out refusal.</p>, <p>\"I can carry this much.\"</p>, <p>They were only like, one... two... three.... eight books?</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Though he didn't show it with his face, he seemed a little doubtful. But he still relented and wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p>, <p>Aoife quietly picked up her pace to catch up to him, when...</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>One of the books fell due to her carelessness. Or more like, she was just not paying attention. With her reflexes, she could've easily avoided such a situation.</p>, <p>\"I'll get it.\"</p>, <p>Leon offered to help and bent down to pick up the book.</p>, <p>\"An English book...?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? Ah, yes...\"</p>, <p>It was one of the books that Julien had left on his desk. She was curious about it. For him to be so good at English, surely there must've been reason. Therefore, after thinking about it, she decided to pick up that book.</p>, <p>Though she didn't particularly like him, she had to admit that he was competent. Her goal was to become the best.</p>, <p>Therefore, she needed to pick up things from the best.</p>, <p>\"Tough language.\"</p>, <p>Leon casually glanced at the cover of the book, his eyes squinting slightly as he tried to decipher the meaning of the title. Only for his entire body to freeze the next second.</p>, <p>\"Leon...?</p>, <p>Noticing a change in his demeanor, Aoife cocked her head. What's wrong with him?</p>, <p>\"....Where did you get this?\"</p>, <p>His voice came out even. Strangely so.</p>, <p>\"Where did I get this? I got it from the library...\"</p>, <p>\"Oh. I see.\"</p>, <p>He nodded calmly.</p>, <p>Then, he handed it back to her.</p>, <p>\"Burn it.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Was this a joke?</p>, <p>Aoife thought so at first, but when she looked at his face, she couldn't help but be taken aback.</p>, <p>He seemed serious. Almost desperate.</p>, <p>\"Just...\"</p>, <p>His eyes trembled. He seemed shaken.</p>, <p>The stupefied Aoife narrowed her eyes and carefully looked at Leon.</p>, <p>'What is....'</p>, <p>\".....Don't ever give this to Julien.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>Yet again, Aoife was taken aback.</p>, <p>But I got it from him...</p>, <p>\"Never.\"</p>, <p>He made sure to emphasize before excusing himself, leaving her standing dumbly. As he left, she ended up overhearing his mutters, 'Cursed book...'</p>, <p>\"What kind of situation is this...?\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned and finally paid attention to the book. She hadn't paid attention to the title before since she just took it for the sake of it, but now she was intrigued.</p>, <p>Just what kind of book could get Leon so shaken up?</p>, <p>Her eyes squinted as she translated the title.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Soon, the title became clear to her. And her expression changed.</p>, <p>: 145 Jokes that will have you rolling on the floor.</p>, <p>It was a book about jokes.</p>, <p>\"What sort of—\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Did the nobles hate the commoners?</p>, <p>Not in particular. At least, the vast majority didn't.</p>, <p>As future lords of their territory, most nobles understood the importance of commoners and how vital they were to their territory.</p>, <p>In fact, most nobles tended to build good relationships with talented commoners.</p>, <p>Everyone at Haven was talented.</p>, <p>Some were less than others, but they were generally all very talented individuals. One needed to have a certain standard to get here after all.</p>, <p>As such, for aspiring nobles, it was important to build good relationships with them.</p>, <p>At least...</p>, <p>That was how it usually was.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, things were different this year. Without someone to properly lead the first years, cadets with different agendas were allowed to come to power, shifting the overall situation.</p>, <p>\"What did you say...? He wants to talk to me?\"</p>, <p>A well-built young man, his blonde hair framing his jewel-like blue eyes, wore a frown.</p>, <p>Clutching a cup filled with wine, he directed his gaze at the four figures standing before him, their heads slightly lowered.</p>, <p>Anders Lewis Richmond.</p>, <p>First heir of the Richmond family—one of the four Marquess families—and the current leader of the 'noble' faction.</p>, <p>\"Why is he suddenly interfering?\"</p>, <p>His deep voice echoed in the quiet environment. His hold of the cup tightened as his expression scrunched up.</p>, <p>A face appeared in his mind.</p>, <p>He couldn't forget that face. How could he forget...?</p>, <p>His cold and overbearing gaze as he looked down on him. From the utter disregard and contempt within his gaze, and the last words he muttered to him.</p>, <p>'.....Pathetic.'</p>, <p>Anders's grip on his glass tightened as his teeth gnashed.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, he suppressed the rage that was barely about to slip out of him.</p>, <p>Closing his eyes, he deeply pondered over the situation before asking,</p>, <p>\"Tomorrow... Isn't it the survival guidance class?\"</p>, <p>\"That's correct.\"</p>, <p>\"And he said he wants to talk to me tomorrow?\"</p>, <p>\"That's correct...\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Seemingly having come up with a decision, Anders finally opened his eyes.</p>, <p>\"Alright.\"</p>, <p>His lips gently pulled up.</p>, <p>\"...I'll talk to him tomorrow.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p> It was early in the morning, and the sun was barely up. The morning breeze wafted through, adding a certain chill to the air.</p>, <p>We stood at the edge of a towering forest where trees of various sizes comprised the vast majority of the landscape. The forest—Hargrave Forest—was connected to the Institute and was considered safe by the instructor.</p>, <p>\"Line up quickly.\"</p>, <p>The instructor, Candace Wallace, positioned us in a long line before the forest.</p>, <p>I stood at the very front.</p>, <p>That was only natural since the order was assigned based on rank.</p>, <p>As such, Leon stood behind me.</p>, <p>He seemed a little odd today. Very odd. Especially since the first thing he had asked me this morning was if I had seen the book.</p>, <p>What book...?</p>, <p>\"In the backpacks, you will find all the necessary equipment for the upcoming task. In total, it'll last for a day. Points will be earned based on the criteria given to you in the booklet.\"</p>, <p>The class was called [Basic Survival Guideline]. It was a class that focused on the basics of survival. The objective of the class was to acclimate the cadets to living in the challenging environments of the mirror dimension.</p>, <p>From what I read, they were a lot worse than this.</p>, <p>Given the nature of the course, a 'non-combat' based one, I was judged to be eligible to attend this class.</p>, <p>\"On that note, everyone please welcome Professor Bucklam.\"</p>, <p>Professor Wallance suddenly stopped to the side and introduced someone.</p>, <p>The individual in question was a middle-aged man with graying dark hair and a mustache. What caught one's attention the most were his distinctive circular gold-framed glasses which seemed oddly fitting.</p>, <p>Coupled with the wooden cane in his hand, he looked extremely refined.</p>, <p>Why does he seem so familiar...?</p>, <p>His appearance sparked something in my mind as I felt his figure to be vaguely familiar. But where exactly...?</p>, <p>\".....Ah.\"</p>, <p>Then I recalled.</p>, <p>He was the one playing checkers by himself yesterday.</p>, <p>'So it was him...'</p>, <p>\"I can't believe it's really him...\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>A noticeable change occurred in the faces of the cadets behind me.</p>, <p>\"Holy crap, it's Professor Bucklam.\"</p>, <p>\"...Wow, it's really him.\"</p>, <p>\"But I heard that he was still ill...\"</p>, <p>The way the students talked about him made him appear to be a very important person.</p>, <p>\"He's a very important figure. One of the top professors in the Academy. Well... was.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, I had Leon with me as he gave me a brief rundown of the situation while he whispered near my ear.</p>, <p>\"Was...?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah, he sustained an injury a few years back. He hasn't been the same since. His power dropped a lot too.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I looked back at that man who stood at the front. He seemed like an extremely warm person at first glance. Like a neighborhood uncle who everyone was friendly with.</p>, <p>\"Haha, it seems like everyone is already aware of my identity.\"</p>, <p>Even his laugh was warm.</p>, <p>\"Please don't worry about my appearance. I'm only here to observe several cadets. As you are all aware, the draft will be coming at the end of the year. I want to make sure that we select the best of the best.\"</p>, <p>Draft...?</p>, <p>A new term I was unfamiliar with entered my mind.</p>, <p>I thought about asking Leon but chose against it given that he was currently speaking. I made a mental note in my mind.</p>, <p>\".....So, while this is indeed just a regular class, I'll be here to monitor you guys and observe your performance. Don't feel too concerned. This won't be the only class I'll monitor, so please feel free to go at your own pace.\"</p>, <p>He then went on to ramble about the same thing for the next few minutes before finishing.</p>, <p>\"I have taken enough of your time. Please go on your way to do your thing.\"</p>, <p>Clap. Clap. Clap!</p>, <p>The cadets began to clap.</p>, <p>I did too.</p>, <p>He returned our claps with a slight bow as Professor Wallace stepped ahead.</p>, <p>\"You've heard him. Don't feel too pressured. There will be many chances for you to prove yourself.\"</p>, <p>She proceeded to clap her hands and I felt my body levitate all of a sudden.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? What's go—\"</p>, <p>Clap—!</p>, <p>\"Have a nice trip~\"</p>, <p>Those were the last words I heard before the world turned dark.</p>, <p>Thud...!</p>, <p>Light only returned after I felt my feet touch against something hard, and even then, the light was just minimal.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>When I looked around, I realized.</p>, <p>I was in the middle of the forest. Alone.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Right as the students were teleported, Professor Wallace turned to address Professor Bucklam.</p>, <p>\"Has anyone caught your eye?\"</p>, <p>\"....A few.\"</p>, <p>The Professor replied with a thin smile. Leaning slightly on his cane, he stared into the forest as his eyes squinted.</p>, <p>\"Aoife, Leon, Kiera, Julien, Evelyn, Luxon, Anders... There's a lot of interesting cadets.\"</p>, <p>\"There's indeed quite a lot of talented individuals this year. More than the previous years.\"</p>, <p>\"Haha, yes. The draft is going to be quite difficult this year.\"</p>, <p>\"But isn't that a good thing?\"</p>, <p>\"Of course it is. The more competition, the better the final candidates.\"</p>, <p>\"Indeed.\"</p>, <p>Professor Wallance nodded in understanding. The Draft was an important event for the Academy. It was an event that happened at the end of the year and only the top cadets were eligible for the honor.</p>, <p>But even that was just the start.</p>, <p>There were further steps down the line that the cadets needed to follow after becoming eligible.</p>, <p>And it was the 'scout's' job to make sure the selected members were good enough to pass such steps.</p>, <p>Professor Backlam was one such scout.</p>, <p>\"...I guess it's time for me to do my job.\"</p>, <p>Lowering his head slightly, Professor Bucklam smiled. Then, without turning back, he calmly headed toward the forest, his figure disappearing into its depths.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Candice remained standing where she was for several minutes. Her mind wandered back to his back.</p>, <p>Though he seemed warm and kind, all Candice could see was loneliness.</p>, <p>It was to be expected given his situation.</p>, <p>He had once been so brilliant, and yet...</p>, <p>She pursed her lips and shook her head.</p>, <p>\"A pity. If only he didn't... Haa...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was dark and humid. My clothes clung to my skin, and the smell of my sweat permeated around. I was uncomfortable, but this much I could handle. There had been times in my previous life when I had been subjected to worse conditions at my job.</p>, <p>'Fucking bastards...'</p>, <p>The thought still irritated me to this day.</p>, <p>In any case...</p>, <p>I took out the guidebook from my bag and stared at its contents.</p>, <p>: Find water source — 1P</p>, <p>: Find food source — 1P</p>, <p>: Create shelter — 4 P</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>In short.</p>, <p>\"Survive for a day.\"</p>, <p>With each objective achieved, one would earn points. The one who had the most points by the end would be ranked first. Because of my obvious disability, my results didn't matter as much.</p>, <p>That said, just because the results didn't matter as much, it didn't mean that I wasn't planning on trying.</p>, <p>\"Hoooo...\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I dropped the backpack down and prepared to get my camp ready.</p>, <p>I felt energized and ready.</p>, <p>Although I wasn't in top shape, it didn't mean I couldn't do this.</p>, <p>Such was how I felt.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'Uh...?'</p>, <p>Reality seemed to hate me.</p>, <p>Just as I was about to get ready to start, the world turned black. When light returned, I found myself back in the forest, but at an entirely different place.</p>, <p>Clank....!</p>, <p>Sparks flew in the air and the nearby vegetation shattered.</p>, <p>'What's going on?'</p>, <p>My voice refused to come out of my mouth. As if it were trapped in my mind. And it was then that I understood what was happening.</p>, <p>This familiar feeling...</p>, <p>The vivid sensations but the weird strange of entrapment...</p>, <p>'Vision.'</p>, <p>I was experiencing another vision.</p>, <p>'Shit...'</p>, <p>I wanted to curse. Of all times now...? No, when had it really had good timing? They always came randomly, and when I least expected them.</p>, <p>I once again wanted to curse at my situation, but I knew I couldn't.</p>, <p>The vision, though random, always ended up pointing out important events.</p>, <p>'Perhaps, major or minor events from the game...'</p>, <p>I wasn't aware since I had never played the game. But that wasn't currently important.</p>, <p>Booom!</p>, <p>Several trees shattered, their remains flying in all sorts of directions. A figure gradually appeared, lying down on the ground with a pained expression.</p>, <p>\"Ugh...\"</p>, <p>It was a familiar face.</p>, <p>Long white hair, deep red eyes...</p>, <p>'Kiera?'</p>, <p>Was this vision about-</p>, <p>\"Kh...! Shit.\"</p>, <p>Kiera forced herself up as blood dripped down from her mouth. Her expression almost seemed desperate. No, she really was...</p>, <p>\"H-how... Why...?\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened as she suddenly screamed.</p>, <p>\"Wait...! No!!\"</p>, <p>Booom!</p>, <p>Several more trees shattered as a huge explosion resounded. A gale rushed from the front as my ears rang.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>Something heavy fell right next to where I stood.</p>, <p>I couldn't see at first due to the dust, but when it all cleared...</p>, <p>'....!'</p>, <p>I stood rigid on the spot.</p>, <p>My heart tightened and my face stiffened. An array of different emotions coursed through my mind in that moment as I struggled to understand what I was seeing.</p>, <p>'This...'</p>, <p>I looked down at the familiar face.</p>, <p>The supposed main character.

Whoever the figure was, it hadn't come out unscathed from the conflict with Leon.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>The silence that gripped the surrounding felt stifling.</p>, <p> Kiera, who was a few meters away, stood in silence, staring at the scene with a look of despair as she tried to force herself up.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>But it was to no avail.</p>, <p>Her legs were broken.</p>, <p>The last thing I heard before the vision shattered was...</p>, <p>\"Y-you of all people...\"</p>, <p>Everything grew dark again and I felt in control of my body again.</p>, <p>\"Huaaaa...!\"</p>, <p>I heavily gulped for air the moment I regained control of my body as I hunched over and leaned my hand on a nearby tree for support.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>Sweat trickled down the side of my face as my breath left my body.</p>, <p>Ba... Thump! Ba... Thump!</p>, <p>I could hear the sound of my own heartbeat in my mind as I tried to recover from the shock of the vision.</p>, <p>\"Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My head felt light and the world blurry.</p>, <p>But in spite of that, I had no choice but to recover fast.</p>, <p>\"F... haaa... fucking shit.\"</p>, <p>A curse slipped my mouth and I ruffled my head.</p>, <p>'Now of all the fucking times...'</p>, <p>Just what sort of situation was this...? Couldn't I catch a break for once?</p>, <p>\"Huuu...\"</p>, <p>Though I complained, I was already rummaging through my backpack where I took a small red object.</p>, <p>[Emergency use only]</p>, <p>I stared at the device in my hand. It was something that all cadets were given. Although the area was safe, and most cadets were powerful, accidents could happen. The device was supposed to be used in case such cases occurred.</p>, <p>That said...</p>, <p>\"....What kind of excuse am I going to use?\"</p>, <p>There were repercussions to using the device in case there was no emergency.</p>, <p>I was afraid of such consequences, but...</p>, <p>\"Whatever.\"</p>, <p>It wasn't something I could think about at the moment. At worst, I could just say that my injuries were too much for me.</p>, <p>With such thoughts, I pressed on the device.</p>, <p>Click--</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Nothing happened.</p>, <p>\"What...?\"</p>, <p>Click--</p>, <p>I clicked again.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Yet again, nothing happened.</p>, <p>That's when I realized. My device... It was broken.</p>, <p>\"This....\"</p>, <p>I felt my stomach drop at the realization. This couldn't be a coincidence, right...?</p>, <p>There was simply no way. At the very least, I refused to believe that to be the case. It certainly had something to do with the situation.</p>, <p>But yet again...</p>, <p>It brought a new question to my mind.</p>, <p>\"Why is the institute not aware of this?\"</p>, <p>Was this perhaps another one of their tests...?</p>, <p>\"No, it's not.\"</p>, <p>I could still recall Leon's lifeless expression as he fell by my feet. Kiera's shocked expression, and the intensity of the obscured figure in the vision.</p>, <p>This...</p>, <p>It wasn't a test.</p>, <p>This was real.</p>, <p>\"Fuck...\"</p>, <p>I could do nothing but curse. I was at a loss as to what to do. The figure was a lot stronger than me. To be able to kill Leon, a Tier 2 knight... It had to be at least Tier 3 in strength.</p>, <p>The higher the tier, the faster, and more efficient they were with controlling mana and utilizing spells.</p>, <p>I was merely at Tier 1.</p>, <p>How was I supposed to do anything about the figure...?</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Damn it.\"</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth and grabbed my backpack.</p>, <p>I had no choice but to do something.</p>, <p>Leon couldn't die.</p>, <p>If he died...</p>, <p>I was screwed.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A strange silence gripped the surroundings as Leon carefully scanned the landscape.</p>, <p>There was something about the environment that felt...</p>, <p>Unsettling.</p>, <p>SHIIIIING----!</p>, <p>He unsheathed his sword and narrowed his eyes. A grave expression marred his features.</p>, <p>All humans were born with a [Innate] skill. Though the Academy didn't require one to share what it was, a few cadets with lower talents tended to expose it in hopes of getting accepted.</p>, <p>Leon's [Innate] skill was called [Instinct].</p>, <p>It was an innate skill that granted him the ability to feel when things weren't right.</p>, <p>It was for this exact reason that he was sure that the current 'Julien' was a fake, and that he hadn't been lying about his circumstances back then.</p>, <p>....And it was also for this exact reason that he was hesitant about fighting him.</p>, <p>His instincts...</p>, <p>They told him to not fight him.</p>, <p>That he wasn't someone that he could easily take on.</p>, <p>\"Huuuu...\"</p>, <p>There were hardly any times when his instincts had been wrong. There were occasions where they had been, but those times were rare and he always liked to play things safe. And it also wasn't like it was active at all times.</p>, <p>There were many times his instincts didn't detect anything. But in the rare times that they did... He always made sure to be ready.</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>Scanning around once more, he secretly started to run the mana in his body.</p>, <p>As a Tier 2 knight, his senses were rather sharp. Within moments, he felt every little detail of his surroundings.</p>, <p>From the speed of the wind to the number of grass stalks around him.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>It was also because of this that he was able to react in time, suddenly shifting his body by pivoting his foot and positioning the blade in front of him.</p>, <p>Bang--!</p>, <p>Sparks flew in the air as Leon felt his body skid several meters back before stopping.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>A groan inevitably escaped from his lips as he felt his chest cave slightly. The power of that strike...</p>, <p>It wasn't something he would've been able to take on unguarded.</p>, <p>Whoever this enemy was...</p>, <p>They were without a doubt stronger than him.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>Leon felt his body tense as the nearby bushes rustled and a figure gradually became clear for him to see.</p>, <p>When the figure became clear, Leon's eyes widened and his expression cracked.</p>, <p>\"It's you...?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"What am I supposed to do...?\"</p>, <p>I was lost. I had no idea where to start. The forest was massive, and finding Leon was easier said than done.</p>, <p>The only thing that I knew was the exact details of the location.</p>, <p>I remembered almost every little detail about the space.</p>, <p>But that was it...</p>, <p>Where exactly it was, I wasn't sure. Even the map in my hand was of no use.</p>, <p>'Crap...'</p>, <p>By now he had most likely already met the enemy. For how long could he last? A minute? Two minutes? Ten minutes...?</p>, <p>The idea ate at my mind as I continued forward. I had no choice but to move. Leon couldn't die... His death would mean that the likelihood of me getting exposed as a 'fraud' was almost guaranteed.</p>, <p>What then...?</p>, <p>Go into hiding and wait for the world to forget about me? Even if that was possible, that wasn't what I wanted.</p>, <p>I had a clear goal in mind.</p>, <p>And Leon was the key piece to helping me achieve that goal.</p>, <p>....I couldn't do without him.</p>, <p>\"He can't die...\"</p>, <p>I reminded myself of the fact.</p>, <p>He couldn't die.</p>, <p>\"Haaa.... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>I had been running for a few minutes, when...</p>, <p>Rustle--</p>, <p>The bushes near me rustled and a voice followed suit.</p>, <p>\"Found you.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Tsk.....\"</p>, <p>Kiera clicked her tongue as she looked around. She was all by herself in the forest with no one in sight.</p>, <p>Her hands tingled and she instinctively reached for her pocket.</p>, <p>But they were empty.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her heart started to beat faster.</p>, <p>So did her breathing as her fingers twitched. A sense of emptiness spread across her chest as her left eye twitched.</p>, <p>\"Shit...\"</p>, <p>Why did people smoke....? Each person had their own answer to the question.</p>, <p>Kiera's answer was...</p>, <p>'It's warm.'</p>, <p>Her lungs would heat up, her mind would relax, and she'd forget that she wasn't alone for a moment.</p>, <p>It was the gruesome reality of her life.</p>, <p>She was alone.</p>, <p>The people she called 'family' only cared about prestige and honor. It was for this reason that despite being one herself, she hated nobles.</p>, <p>She also hated the dark.</p>, <p>It felt stifling.</p>, <p>It was her curse. She didn't even know why she was like it. It had been like this for as long as she could remember. But it had haunted her for as long as she could remember.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that she smoked.</p>, <p>To her...</p>, <p>Smoking was her medicine.</p>, <p>It brought warmth.</p>, <p>Ziiiip--</p>, <p>Kiera unzipped her bag where she took out a pack of cigarettes.</p>, <p>[Milton's Rose]</p>, <p>The familiar box, and the the familiar smell. Briefly, it eased the darkness that surrounded her.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>An orange light flickered in the dark as Kiera took a drag of the cigarette.</p>, <p>Her lungs burned with an all too familiar sensation, and her mind calmed down. But she soon frowned.</p>, <p>\"....Looks like I need to change the intensity.\"</p>, <p>Cigarettes had different intensities. Mainly because superhumans that were capable of wielding mana had certain resistance to the chemicals in normal cigarettes.</p>, <p>It was hence why the cigarettes that Kiera was using were specifically designed for superhumans.</p>, <p>While normal cigarettes couldn't harm them, these ones could....</p>, <p>The higher the Tier she reached, the more intense the cigarette had to be for her to feel anything.</p>, <p>It was also because of this that the damage from smoking couldn't be healed.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>But it wasn't like she cared.</p>, <p>Closing her eyes, she leaned against a nearby tree and savored the taste of the cigarette.</p>, <p>Her mind relaxed and all her worries disappeared.</p>, <p>By the time she was done, her mind was clear. The dark didn't seem as intimidating as it had been moments prior.</p>, <p>Her body felt warm.</p>, <p>\"Let's get this shit done.\"</p>, <p>She tossed the pack back into her bag and took out the booklet for the task.</p>, <p>Flip--!</p>, <p>She had just opened the first page when...</p>, <p>--------!</p>, <p>A resounding roar reverberated. At the same time, the ground beneath her quaked, and the nearby trees shattered.</p>, <p>Her body's equilibrium shifted, leaving her with no time to respond.</p>, <p>\"...Huh?\"</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>A figure skidded back, only stopping after impaling their sword against the ground.</p>, <p>Kiera's eyes widened at the sight of him.</p>, <p>And her mouth opened to mumble,</p>, <p>\"Leon...?\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Rustle—</p>, <p>The bushes rustled and a figure I vaguely felt was familiar appeared.</p>, <p>'Who is he…?'</p>, <p>\"You were looking for me?\"</p>, <p>A dry voice came out from my lips as I grew wary. He couldn't be someone related to the one in the vision?</p>, <p>If that was the case...</p>, <p>My body grew tense and I started to channel the mana inside of my body.</p>, <p>\"Didn't you say you wanted to see me? I am here.\"</p>, <p>\"….?\"</p>, <p>Wanted to see me?</p>, <p>I paused and thought about it. Then, as if recalling the events of yesterday, I realized.</p>, <p>\"You're the leader of the noble faction?\"</p>, <p>Right, judging from his age, and the fact that he felt familiar, this made sense. Especially since I distinctly remembered asking his minion to tell him to come to me.</p>, <p>\"....How did you find me?\"</p>, <p>Weren't we supposed to be stranded in the middle of a forest?</p>, <p>For him to find me…</p>, <p>I frowned and had a sudden thought. Just then, he appeared to want to say something as his mouth opened, but...</p>, <p>\"...I want to—\"</p>, <p>I cut him off immediately and lightly tossed something in his direction.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>It landed right beneath his feet, stopping him as he looked down.</p>, <p>I took the chance to explain.</p>, <p>\"My emergency device doesn't work. I believe yours doesn't work as well. I think we're under attack.\"</p>, <p>\"Under attack...?\"</p>, <p>He looked back at me, his eyes wearier than before.</p>, <p>\"...Are you trying to get my guard down or something.\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Perhaps because time was running out and I couldn't waste time, my voice came out rather harsh as I squinted my eyes at him.</p>, <p>\"That's a needless effort on someone like you. Check your device.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>His face scrunched up, but under my serious gaze, he eventually relented and opened his backpack, taking out a similar device from his it.</p>, <p>He turned to look at me and seemed to want to say something, but after staring into my eyes, he thought otherwise and just pressed on the device.</p>, <p>Click—</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>As expected, his didn't work either.</p>, <p> \"This...\"</p>, <p>Finally, his expression changed as he realized the gravity of the situation. But I didn't have time to waste.</p>, <p>Therefore, I carefully approached him, only stopping a few meters away from him.</p>, <p>I looked down at him to meet his eyes.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I thought back on the situation and how he had managed to find me.</p>, <p>It was only a guess, but maybe...</p>, <p>\"Help me find someone.\"</p>, <p>He could help me find Leon's location.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Rustle, Rustle, Rustle—</p>, <p>'Why am I even doing this...?'</p>, <p>Anders continued to run, pushing the vegetation away. Fiddling with the necklace on his neck, he looked behind him where a figure was casually following him.</p>, <p>Even now...</p>, <p>He seemed unfazed by the situation as he looked around with the same expression he always wore.</p>, <p>It was as if he didn't seem bothered by the entire situation. And yet, he was also the first one to notice.</p>, <p>'How did he know?'</p>, <p>Anders was curious. He turned his head slightly, when...</p>, <p>\"How far?\"</p>, <p>Julien's voice reached his ears.</p>, <p>Even the tone of his voice sounded annoying to his ears.</p>, <p>He was the last person he thought he'd work with, but...</p>, <p>'....I have no choice.\"</p>, <p>The circumstances left him with no choice but to work with him. He didn't trust him, but he trusted his abilities.</p>, <p>After all...</p>, <p>He had experienced them firsthand.</p>, <p>\"We should be getting closer.\"</p>, <p>\"Mhm.\"</p>, <p>Julien acknowledged with a soft hum, his attention once again on the surroundings. Anders pursed his lips and continued forward.</p>, <p>His [Innate] ability—[Predator's Plight]—granted him with the ability to enhance his senses. Be it his eyesight, smell, and hearing. It was thanks to his ability that he had been able to find Julien easily.</p>, <p>His original plan had been to face him head-on. He thought about sneaking up on him, but that simply went against his morals.</p>, <p>He was no coward, after all.</p>, <p>As they moved forward, Anders suddenly grew curious.</p>, <p>\"....Can you tell me why you asked me to find Leon instead of the Professors? I'm sure they would be of more help than him.\"</p>, <p>Julien looked ahead and their gazes met.</p>, <p>Anders felt his body freeze under his gaze which seemed to look at him with a bit of contempt.</p>, <p>'This bastard...'</p>, <p>Anders clenched his fists at the sight.</p>, <p>Julien's voice reached his ears shortly after.</p>, <p>\"If the culprit is capable of disabling the emergency device, what makes you think they won't interfere with the professors?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Julien's answer left him at a loss for words.</p>, <p>Indeed, when he put it like that...</p>, <p>\"Slow down.\"</p>, <p>Julien's voice reached him again from behind.</p>, <p>This time, it felt a lot more intimidating.</p>, <p>\".....I have an idea of where we are.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'If the culprit is capable of disabling the emergency device, what makes you think they won't interfere with the professors?'</p>, <p>Yeah, no.</p>, <p>That was total bullshit.</p>, <p>While there was some truth to it, I had no idea whether the professors had been 'distracted' or 'taken care of'. The only thing that I cared about was getting to Leon before it was too late.</p>, <p>That being said...</p>, <p>'....If I can't, I won't.'</p>, <p>The idea behind saving Leon stemmed from the fact that I needed him. He was the main character of the game and my shield.</p>, <p>What sort of consequences was his death going to bring to the game?</p>, <p>That, I wasn't sure and I had never really thought about it. However, on further thought, his death was sure to bring a lot of variables to my future.</p>, <p>As of right now...</p>, <p>Although we both didn't trust each other, the two of us were allies.</p>, <p>As an ally, it was my duty to help him out when needed. But that didn't mean I'd have to throw my life away to help him.</p>, <p>If the situation seemed impossible then...</p>, <p>\"Huuu\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes.</p>, <p>'....Let's see when I get there.'</p>, <p>The current plan was to interfere when most opportune. Given that at some point Leon managed to injure the enemy, an opening certainly existed.</p>, <p>I planned on exploiting it.</p>, <p>Opening my eyes again, I slowed down my pace.</p>, <p>\"Stop.\"</p>, <p>Anders similarly stopped as he turned to look at me. I placed my finger on my lips before he could say anything and whispered.</p>, <p>\"Keep your voice down from this moment forth.\"</p>, <p>\"...?\"</p>, <p>He seemed confused as he looked around him and squinted. But after an internal debate, he relented and nodded.</p>, <p>\"....Fine.\"</p>, <p>'Now that I look at him, he seems quite reasonable...'</p>, <p>It took me no time to realize who he was. Back then, I had been so immersed in my emotions that I hadn't paid proper attention to how he looked. However, his face was now clear to me and the situation was rather funny.</p>, <p>Who'd have thought I'd end up working with the same person that I used to prove my worth in the middle of the lecture?</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>I quietly led him forward. The surroundings were the same as I remembered. From the trees to the smell that lingered in the air.</p>, <p>If there was one good thing about the visions, it was that I could remember every single detail with perfect memory...</p>, <p>It was thanks to that that I was able to find the location rather quickly.</p>, <p>\"This is it.\"</p>, <p>The exact same spot where Leon died.</p>, <p>It was where I was currently standing.</p>, <p>'They aren't here yet which means that I'm still early.'</p>, <p>I sighed in relief at the idea and looked around me. Only to see Anders looking at me in confusion. I could guess exactly what he was thinking from his expression.</p>, <p>\"Use your abilities. See if there's anyone near us.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...? Why-\"</p>, <p>\"Do it.\"</p>, <p>He frowned but nonetheless listened. Was he afraid of me, or were the circumstances making him act this way?</p>, <p>In a way, I could see how he had become the leader of the nobles.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>His eyes quickly widened a few moments after he closed them and his gaze turned to look to the right where he pointed.</p>, <p>\"Over there...\"</p>, <p>I followed the direction of where he pointed as he continued, his voice trembling slightly.</p>, <p>\"There are multiple people. A large conflict—uh, wait!\"</p>, <p>Though he tried to stop me, I was already moving. The situation was still not bad. Since Leon could deal some damage to the opponent if I played my cards right...</p>, <p>\"Uhm?\"</p>, <p>My eyebrow twitched as I felt a sharp pain in my arm. It hurt so much that I had to stop for a brief moment. What sort of... I turned my wrist over to see what was going on when my eyes shot up.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>The second leaf.</p>, <p>The one that I was unsure of what it did.</p>, <p>It was shining brightly.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>\"Uekh...!\"</p>, <p>Leon felt his back crash against a nearby tree as he felt himself lose his breath.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>He landed on the ground, only keeping himself from falling thanks to his sword which he used to support himself.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>With uneven breathing, he looked up. Even now, he struggled to understand. How...? How was it possible?</p>, <p>\"The fuck is this? Aren't you supposed to be our Professor?\"</p>, <p>Kiera's startled voice echoed from his left as she held her hand forward. A red magic circle floated at the tips of her fingers.</p>, <p>Swoosh!</p>, <p>Flames surged from all around her, enveloping her entire body as amidst the inferno, her eyes, reminiscent of rubies, gleamed brightly, piercing through the raging blaze surrounding her.</p>, <p>Thrusting her hand forward, the flames enveloping her body twisted and coiled like a serpent before surging forward where a figure stood.</p>, <p>Unfortunately...</p>, <p>!</p>, <p>The flames, which had been raging with a lot of intensity, were quickly put out with a single swipe of a cane.</p>, <p>Kiera's expression changed drastically at this, but before she could do anything...</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>Her body was flung several meters back, crashing against the dirt as she skidded back several meters.</p>, <p>\"Uhk...\"</p>, <p>Her groaned reached Leon as he tightly held on the sword in his hand and stared ahead.</p>, <p>Indeed. They were severely outclassed. But how could they not be when their opponent was a Tier 3 opponent? Although the two of them were both Tier 2, their powers were still outstripped.</p>, <p>It took more than two Tier 2 individuals to get rid of someone of that caliber.</p>, <p>And to make matters worse, this was no regular opponent...</p>, <p>'Professor Bucklam.'</p>, <p>Even now, Leon didn't fully understand the situation. How could it be him? Was this a test, or was this real?</p>, <p>At first, he thought it was, but his 'instincts' told him otherwise.</p>, <p>That was when it became clear to him.</p>, <p>Professor Bucklam. For whatever reason... He was trying to kill them.</p>, <p>No, him.</p>, <p>Why?</p>, <p>Leon wasn't sure, but...</p>, <p>\"Ukh.\"</p>, <p>He didn't have the time to care. Pressing his foot against the ground, he propelled his body forward.</p>, <p>Within moments, he arrived a few inches away from the Professor's body as he swung his blade.</p>, <p>It curved in the air and directly aimed at the Professor's exposed neck.</p>, <p>Everything was fluent. From the precision of his attack to its speed.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>His sword bounced back the moment it came down and a large translucent sphere formed around the professor's body. [Mana Sphere] an intermediate-ranked spell that provided a mage with great defense.</p>, <p>It covered his entire body and flickered the moment it came into contact with Leon's sword.</p>, <p>But that was it.</p>, <p>The force behind Leon's sword wasn't powerful enough to break it, leaving Leon exposed to a counterattack.</p>, <p>Swoosh!</p>, <p>Professor Bucklam took advantage of that moment as his cane came slashing down on Leon who just barely managed to avoid it by twisting his body in the air.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>Falling down, Leon pushed his body forward again and swung his sword.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>Regardless of...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>What he did...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>The shield surrounding the professor refused to budge.</p>, <p>\"Haaa.... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>Leon felt his breath grow heavy with each attempt. It wasn't just him.</p>, <p>Swoosh!</p>, <p>A fire directed itself toward the Professor, but even that was of no use as it simply scattered the moment it touched it.</p>, <p>\"What kind of fucking shield is this?\"</p>, <p>Leon could hear Kiera's curse from behind as she channeled another spell. Thinking about something, Leon bit his lips before bringing his body forward to slash at the shield.</p>, <p>Professor Bucklam prepared to receive Leon when his figure faded and disappeared.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>By the time Leon's touched the ground, he was standing behind Kiera who looked startled by the sight of him.</p>, <p>\"Holy fuck! What are you doing?...That scared the shit out of me.\"</p>, <p>\"Hold him back for me.\"</p>, <p>A white glow formed over Leon's sword. Its aura intensifying by the second.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>Kiera was startled at first, but realizing what Leon was trying to do, she bit her lips and nodded.</p>, <p>\"Fuck... Whatever, do it.\"</p>, <p>The flames around her body intensified and the temperature around them rose to an alarming degree.</p>, <p>They were so intense that the surrounding grass and trees started to catch fire.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Kiera's breath started to grow heavy, but gritting her teeth, she pushed her hand forward, and the fire around her split into several threads which all rushed toward the professor who frowned and slashed with his cane.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, as if they had a mind of their own, the threads diverged, encircling him before adhering to the ground and forming a cage</p>, <p>\"N-now...!\"</p>, <p>Kiera shouted as she looked behind her where a powerful glow appeared.</p>, <p>An intense mana wave wafted through the air as Leon's sword shone with a majestic light. He didn't hesitate to move the moment she spoke.</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>The ground caved as his body zoomed toward the professor.</p>, <p>\"Khuek...!\"</p>, <p>An intense pain invaded every part of his body as he rushed forward. His muscles were tearing apart, and his mana was running dangerously low.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>He had no choice.</p>, <p>This was do or die.</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>His foot pressed against the ground, stopping his body just as he neared the professor who appeared somewhat alarmed.</p>, <p>\"Ukh!\"</p>, <p>Pain once again invaded Leon's body as he felt the muscles of his core snap, but he still persisted.</p>, <p>Using everything he had, he swung diagonally in an upward motion.</p>, <p>Booom!</p>, <p>His blade clashed against the professor's shield as it flickered intensively. Unlike before, the flickering was even more pronounced, and just barely, Leon could see cracks form on its surface.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>That wasn't enough.</p>, <p>The shield was still standing.</p>, <p>\"Kh...!!!\"</p>, <p>He clenched his teeth with even more force as he pushed all the remaining mana in his body out and into the sword.</p>, <p>Cr-Crack...!</p>, <p>The cracks around the shield widened. But... It was still not enough.</p>, <p>'Not yet...!'</p>, <p>His lungs were on fire and every part of his body ached.

Goal.</p>, <p>\"Akh...!\"</p>, <p>His sword shone with even fiercer light. It blinded everything that was in sight. Power gushed out from it as the shield around the professor's body creaked under intense stress.</p>, <p>Rather quickly, the cracks started to widen and it was only a matter of time before the shield shattered.</p>, <p>\"Kh!\"</p>, <p>Leon kept pushing.</p>, <p>He used everything that he had to attack in that moment.</p>, <p>But the more he continued, the more he felt his heart drop...</p>, <p>'....It won't be enough.'</p>, <p>It started to become clear to me.</p>, <p>Even if the shield broke, the power behind the sword wouldn't be enough. If things went on like this then...</p>, <p>And then it happened.</p>, <p>Swoosh.</p>, <p>Purple hands sprouted from the ground beneath the professor. They came so abruptly that Professor Bucklam wasn't able to react on time and they latched onto his ankles.</p>, <p>That was all it took...</p>, <p>Crash—!</p>, <p>The shield shattered and Leon finally saw his sword slash down.</p>, <p>Pffttt!</p>, <p>Blood splattered in the air as he felt it make contact with the professor's body.</p>, <p>Clank. Clank.</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>Leon dropped to his knees as the sword scattered on the ground. A strange hung in the air as Leon felt the muscles of his body give up on him.</p>, <p>\"....Did I?\"</p>, <p>But..</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>When he looked up to see, much to Leon's horror, he could still see the Professor standing before him.</p>, <p>A large gaping wound appeared on his body, but his eyes still seemed alive. And they were.</p>, <p>He didn't even seem to care about what was going on around him. The Professor's eyes were fixed on him. As if he was the only thing on his mind.</p>, <p>His hand slowly raised and a magic circle formed.</p>, <p>It was aimed directly at the incapacitated Leon who could do nothing but watch.</p>, <p>No, this...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Just when Leon's eyes despaired, a hand reached out and grasped the Professor by the shoulder.</p>, <p>A pair of familiar hazel eyes met Leon's gaze as a dry voice echoed in the air.</p>, <p>\".....You did not.\"</p>]\n",

I felt in complete control and while I couldn't speak, I could look around and move just fine.</p>, <p>\"You're finally awake.\"</p>, <p>Then, I heard a voice.</p>, <p>A woman sat by the bed where a man rested. There were three other people beside the man. Two boys and a girl. They appeared to be young, in their early teens.</p>, <p>'When did they get here?'</p>, <p>\"Who are you? Where am I?\"</p>, <p>A familiar face. He was younger, but it was without a doubt him.</p>, <p>Professor Bucklam.</p>, <p>'What is this...'</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>\"Father.\"</p>, <p>\"Dad.\"</p>, <p>Information entered my mind at that moment.</p>, <p>A time when an incident occurred and he sustained heavy injuries, forgetting all about his memories. He woke up to find that he was married and had three children. A famed wizard with several groundbreaking theses to his name.</p>, <p>That was who he was and how the world knew him as.</p>, <p>\"Who are you people? Why are you looking at me like that? And why...\"</p>, <p>He squeezed his heart.</p>, <p> Emotions I hadn't expected flooded my mind. It was a familiar emotion and my heart squeezed briefly.</p>, <p>\"....Is my chest like this?\"</p>, <p>Familial love.</p>, <p>Even as his memories faded, his emotions hadn't. The unfamiliar people in front of him... He still cared deeply for them.</p>, <p>It was hence why he was able to push through the confusion and live a normal life.</p>, <p>Because he loved them.</p>, <p>\"Robert, eat this. Is it to your tastes?\"</p>, <p>\"Dad, try it. It's your favorite.\"</p>, <p>\"We made it for you.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes...\"</p>, <p>Warmth.</p>, <p>It felt warm.</p>, <p>\"That was us when we first met.

It warmed his heart to see but also brought emptiness. The person in the photo... It was him, and yet... he felt unfamiliar.</p>, <p>Was this really him?</p>, <p>\"How long do you think it'll take for him to recover his memories?\"</p>, <p>\"It shouldn't take too long.

It was the same park at the Academy. Students walked around and a nice breeze wafted through.</p>, <p>In the distance, a man played checkers by himself.</p>, <p>He was alone but satisfied.</p>, <p>\"How may I help you?\"</p>, <p>He turned his head to address me. His eyes were warm, and so was his smile.</p>, <p>\"...Do you have a question about something? I do have some free time.\"</p>, <p>He placed the piece down.</p>, <p>\"It's not like I have much else to do anyway.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I shook my head and sat down.</p>, <p>\"Oh?\"</p>, <p>\"Teach me how to play.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>The Professor looked at me.

Do you know how to play?\"</p>, <p>\"I don't.\"</p>, <p>\"Hahaha.\"</p>, <p>Even his laugh was warm.</p>, <p>\"Come, I'll teach you.\"</p>, <p>He started to teach me.</p>, <p>\"The pieces can only move diagonally.\"</p>, <p>\"Like this?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>, <p>He continued to explain.</p>, <p>\"This is how you take pieces and how you...\"</p>, <p>He seemed rather passionate.</p>, <p>I listened quietly and followed his instructions.</p>, <p>Seemed pretty easy...</p>, <p>\"I think I got it. We can start.\"</p>, <p>\"Good. Good.\"</p>, <p>Tak, Tak, Tak—</p>, <p>\"You've lost.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I looked at the board and frowned.</p>, <p>I didn't even last a few moves.</p>, <p>What sort of...</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>\"Let's do that.\"</p>, <p>Tak, Tak, Tak—</p>, <p>Again, I lost.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>I didn't give up.</p>, <p>Tak, Tak, Tak—</p>, <p>\"This...

I'll beat you this time.\"</p>, <p>\"Language.\"</p>, <p>Tak, Tak, Tak—</p>, <p>The matches continued. Five, ten, twenty, fifty...</p>, <p>I'd lose each time.</p>, <p>The Professor laughed with each victory. On the other hand, I got angrier.</p>, <p>\"You have to be cheating!\"</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>I slammed my hand against the table.</p>, <p>I had long forgotten about my decorum.</p>, <p>Right now... I wasn't acting. I was being me. The real me.

The reasoning behind his actions has yet to be determined but an investigation is ongoing.]</p>, <p>One of the Haven staff in charge of the Institute's 'public image' commented through a speaker. Several reporters stood a few feet before the podium, holding what seemed to be cameras.</p>, <p>Click. Click. Click.</p>, <p>Their shutters flashed blinding my sight.</p>, <p>'I can't believe they have cameras in this type of setting. They look a little old, but...'</p>, <p> I wanted to admire them more but the situation didn't allow me.</p>, <p>\"Cadet! Cadet! Would you like to leave a statement?\"</p>, <p>\"Cadet! Please let us know what happened. Why did he attack you? And how did you manage to defeat him \"</p>, <p>\"Please leave a statement.\"</p>, <p>Even in this world, reporters were annoying. Not that I knew given that I had never experienced it myself, but from what I had seen enough, it was probably the case.</p>, <p>[The cadets will not be answering the questions now.]</p>, <p>The reporter's attempts at asking us questions were quickly shot down by the staff who went on to announce.</p>, <p>[We're here to award the four cadets standing before us for their achievements. Not only were they able to neutralize the threat, but they did so in such a manner that prevented other cadets from getting injured.]</p>, <p>I sat at the center of the stage alongside Leon, Kiera, and Anders. We were all forced to be here to receive our 'medals' for our exemplary performance.</p>, <p>It was something that the Academy was very adamant about.</p>, <p>\".....What a pain.\"</p>, <p>I thought I had muttered those words quietly, but Kiera managed to pick up my voice.</p>, <p>\"Tell me about it.\"</p>, <p>I silently looked at her in surprise.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"....Nothing.\"</p>, <p>\"No, fuck. You can't just say nothing when you look at me like that.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"Oy.\"</p>, <p>\"Stop. People are watching.\"</p>, <p>Leon interrupted all of a sudden. Kiera was about to speak when she closed her mouth and grunted.</p>, <p>\"Fine.\"</p>, <p>She shot me a glare in the meantime. But I chose to ignore it. She was thinking too much. I thought the situation would end there when...</p>, <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>, <p>I heard Leon's soft voice from beside me. I was surprised for a brief moment but then closed my eyes and leaned back.</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>\".....I only saved you because I could.\"</p>, <p>\"I know.\"</p>, <p>At least he knew.</p>, <p>'I wonder if it was the right decision.'</p>, <p>The decision to save him stemmed from the fact that he was the key person to help me achieve my goal. But at the same time...</p>, <p>'He's the same person that kills me in the vision.'</p>, <p>Indeed, I had potentially saved my killer.</p>, <p>'Killers...'</p>, <p>Kiera was there too.</p>, <p>\"Heh.\"</p>, <p>I found the situation funny. But at the same time, I didn't think too much of it. The visions could change. They weren't set in stone.</p>, <p>Perhaps, in the near future, a situation such as that would indeed happen, but...</p>, <p>'I know it will happen.'</p>, <p>Since I knew it, I could prepare for it.</p>, <p>\"Still, thank you.\"</p>, <p>\"Um.\"</p>, <p>I quietly nodded before opening my eyes again. My gaze eventually fell on my forearm. More specifically, toward the second tattoo.</p>, <p>It had stumped me for the past few days with no reaction whenever I pressed it. I thought that perhaps there was something wrong with it, but recalling the events of last night, I now understood.</p>, <p>'.....It makes me relive someone's most private memories. Another emotion related ability.'</p>, <p>Both my abilities were. No, rather than being abilities, they were more like a medium for me to improve in my understatement of emotions.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>The thought made me sigh.</p>, <p>This was a direct path to insanity. I could feel it.</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Suddenly, a powerful presence appeared in the distance.</p>, <p>\"S-she's here.\"</p>, <p>Click. Click. Click.</p>, <p>Finally, the flashes were directed away from me for once.</p>, <p>When I looked in the distance, a familiar figure appeared. As the Chancellor, it was her duty to assign to us our medals.</p>, <p>Her flowing black hair curved slightly, swaying with each step she took.</p>, <p>Her extraordinary presence exuded regality that went beyond mere perception. With each step she took, a subtle ripple of magical energy, akin to a gentle breeze, flowed around her.</p>, <p>Her innate power had ascended to a level beyond what I could imagine.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Looking around the room with her piercing eyes, Delilah walked up to the stage.</p>, <p>Without paying a single ounce of attention to the reporters, she gracefully made her way toward the podium. Someone then ran up to her and handed her a short list. She quickly glanced at it before passing it back and nodding her head.</p>, <p>[We will now begin the ceremony.]</p>, <p>The announcer stated.</p>, <p>[Our Chancellor will have the honor of providing the cadets with their medals.]</p>, <p>It was pretty straightforward from there. Under the watchful eyes of the reporters and staff, I stood up and walked up to the podium.</p>, <p>We had been instructed beforehand so we knew exactly what we needed to do. From what order to move, and what to say when receiving the award.</p>, <p>I was the first to walk up.</p>, <p>Delilah stared at me with her usual blank look.</p>, <p>\".....You did well. The Institute is grateful for what you've done.\"</p>, <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>, <p>On closer look, she didn't seem to be really comfortable.</p>, <p>I guess she wasn't comfortable with this type of thing.</p>, <p>\"Come closer, I will put the medal on you.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>I did as I was told and leaned my head closer. In the moment when I leaned forward, I heard a soft whisper in my ear.</p>, <p>Feeling her breath on my ear, I shuddered at first.</p>, <p>Then, as I processed her words, my brow jumped up and I had to force myself from making any rash movement.</p>, <p>'Seriously...?'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>The doors of the cell closed and Inquisitor Hallowe came out. His rough steps echoed across the dark corridor as he took a drag from the freshly lit cigarette nestled between his lips.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Waiting for him at the end of the corridor was an older gentleman.</p>, <p>Sporting a bald head and a thick graying mustache, the man stood erect, his slightly protruding belly. In spite of his physical features, he radiated an undeniable aura of authority as the Inquisitor's pace slowed, and he lowered his head.</p>, <p>\"Warden.\"</p>, <p>\"....Have you found anything?\"</p>, <p>The Warden's voice was rough and dry.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>\"I've got something.\"</p>, <p>Hallowe nibbled on his cigarette before taking it out and letting the smoke linger on his lips.</p>, <p>\"His emotions. They were manipulated.\"</p>, <p>The warden's brow raised.</p>, <p>\"An Emotive mage?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah, and a powerful one at that.\"</p>, <p>The Inquisitor's expression turned a little grim. What made Emotive Mages so dangerous? Was it their skill in battle that could disrupt an opponent's flow...? Or was it their support during difficult situations?</p>, <p>It was neither.</p>, <p>The scariest part about Emotive Mages was that they could manipulate just about anyone into doing something they'd normally not do.</p>, <p>By exploiting a weakness and carefully pushing certain buttons...</p>, <p>\"He exploited Bucklam's past and situation and convinced him to do what he did. He most likely was told he'd get healed if he accomplished his job or some nonsense like that. He still hasn't talked, but that's most likely the case since the traces still linger on his body.\"</p>, <p>\"....You didn't hurt him did you?\"</p>, <p>\"No. I'm not into that stuff.\"</p>, <p>\"I was just asking to make sure. Don't want to deal with the annoying aftermath.\"</p>, <p>The Warden then proceeded to frown.</p>, <p>\"What I'm more surprised about is the fact that this happened in Haven. Those guys...\"</p>, <p>Shaking his head, he chuckled.</p>, <p>\"...They were so busy preparing for outside threats that they didn't take into account internal ones. It's the first time I've seen them make such a mistake.\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah...\"</p>, <p>Hallowe agreed to some degree. To some extent, this incident was out of carelessness from the Institute. Because Professor Bucklam had worked with them for so long, nobody thought he was mentally unstable.</p>, <p>It was hence why his actions probably came as a massive surprise to them. While there were means to protect oneself against Emotive Mages, such means were rare and expensive. It wasn't as if the Academy could afford have all cadets and professors to use them.</p>, <p>That brought rise to several questions.</p>, <p>Who was the Emotive Mage behind this, and... Why did he target the cadets? No, cadet.</p>, <p>From the reports, it was clear that he had a specific target.</p>, <p>Leon Ellert.</p>, <p>\"Um.\"</p>, <p>He was a talented cadet in the report.</p>, <p>But that was it...</p>, <p>If the professor's goal was to target talented students, he could've gone for Julien who was ranked above Leon.</p>, <p>If their goal was Haven then Julien's death would've been more impactful.</p>, <p>'Surely, there must be something else....'</p>, <p>\"...What are you going to do now?\"</p>, <p>As his thoughts were broken by the Warden's voice, Hallowe raised his head. Nibbling onto the cigarette, he thought about his words before answering.</p>, <p>\"I'll be going to Haven.\"</p>, <p>\"Haven?\"</p>, <p>The Warden raised his brows in surprise.</p>, <p>\"Are you going to interrogate the cadets?\"</p>, <p>\"....Something like that.\"</p>, <p>But not exactly.</p>, <p>Outside of Leon, there was one individual he was particularly interested in. During the investigation, he had shown Bucklam four pictures. He had only reacted to one.</p>, <p>'Julien of the Evenus Barony and the Black Star.'</p>, <p>It was funny.</p>, <p>He too was an Emotive Mage. A very talented one at that.</p>, <p>'A connection...?'</p>, <p>It seemed unlikely given the potency of the spell used on Bucklam, but... He certainly knew something he didn't. Bucklam wouldn't have reacted like that otherwise.</p>, <p>It was an intriguing thought.</p>, <p>One that teased his mind the more he dabbled on it.</p>, <p>'Looks like I have no choice.'</p>, <p>To satisfy his curiosity…</p>, <p>He had to go.</p>, <p>Flick—</p>, <p>Hallowe flicked his cigarette away before lowering his head.</p>, <p>\"Thank you for sparing me the time. I found what I needed. I'll be heading off now.\"</p>, <p>\".....Alright, take care.\"</p>, <p>\"Will do.\"</p>, <p>Placing on his leather gloves, Hallowe lowered his head at the Warden before leaving.</p>, <p>As his steps echoed across the spirling stairway, his thoughts couldn't help but drift toward the situation.</p>, <p>Julien.</p>, <p>Leon.</p>, <p>'.....Is there truly no connection?'</p>, <p>\"I wonder.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Returning to his dorm after the inauguration, Leon stood still in the silence.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>His gaze was locked on the drawer by his bedside. With careful steps, he neared the drawer and opened it. Nestled inside the drawer was a small box.</p>, <p>Taking out the box, he carefully placed his hand over the box where a white glow formed.</p>, <p>Click--</p>, <p>Only then did it open to reveal its contents. Nestled deep within the box was a black chalice.</p>, <p>An old and antique one.</p>, <p>The contents within the chalice were empty, but there was a strange allure about the chalice that captivated Leon's sight.</p>, <p>He could hear faint whispers in his mind as he looked at it.</p>, <p>They felt disturbing, and his heart quaked.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>His eyes closed and memories he had kept hidden resurfaced in his mind.</p>, <p>A burning mansion.</p>, <p>The desperate screams.</p>, <p>The ominous, shadowy figures that pursued him relentlessly.</p>, <p>....And the cold, yet warm hand that reached out to him.</p>, <p>\"Huuuu.\"</p>, <p>Leon drew in a deep breath, sealing the box within his grip. When he opened his eyes, an icy coldness spread across his face as he quietly mumbled,</p>, <p>\"They've found me.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Tak--</p>, <p>I stared at the book dropped in front of me and looked up. Delilah sat with her back against her chair. Staring at her, I felt my ear twitch. Recalling the moment when she whispered, 'Come to my office after this' into my ear back at the inauguration ceremony still gave me chills.</p>, <p>Thinking about it, I had the sudden urge to tickle my ear.</p>, <p>'Damn it.'</p>, <p>I forced those thoughts away and looked at the book.</p>, <p>\"....What is this?\"</p>, <p>\"Your reward.\"</p>, <p>Reward?</p>, <p>I leaned forward to get a better look at the book. I noticed a small chocolate bar beside the book, and I felt the back of my hair stand when my hand hovered over it.</p>, <p>Thankfully, it disappeared the moment I picked up the book.</p>, <p>\"Mana Synthesis?\"</p>, <p>What a peculiar name.</p>, <p>\"Your biggest weakness right now is the fact that your mana reserves are low. You're outstanding in everything but in your mana control and reserves. Although it isn't much, this is a Blue-ranked manual. It should help you accumulate more mana and speed up your progress.\"</p>, <p>Blue-ranked manual..?</p>, <p>I was surprised a little surprised by the gift. There were many ways one could increase their strength and jump to the next Tier. One such method was through certain manuals that one could practice to increase their mana reserves which would help one push toward the next Tier.</p>, <p> Manuals were ranked as follows; Green, Blue, Orange, Red, and Black.</p>, <p>Black being the highest.</p>, <p>The Academy provided each cadet with a Green-ranked manual at the start. Being a Barony, the one my family provided was also Green-ranked so it wasn't much of a difference.</p>, <p>Therefore, I was a little taken aback by the sudden gift.</p>, <p>Not that I didn't appreciate it since I didn't hesitate to take it.</p>, <p>\"You're still currently injured so I suggest you memorize the contents of the book before you start practicing. From what I'm seeing, ever since the start of the institute, there has been no progress in your tier. I believe this should help you in that matter.\"</p>, <p>\".....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>Indeed, I was still stuck in the same spot I had been from the start.</p>, <p>In the two weeks I had been in the Academy, besides unlocking a spell, the only progress I had made was in the Emotive field.</p>, <p>I had tried practicing the Green-ranked manual provided by the Institute upon entry, but I struggled to make much progress given that my priorities lay elsewhere. Mainly, in the unlockment of my first [Curse] spell.</p>, <p>But I knew things couldn't go on like this.</p>, <p>I was still lagging behind the other cadets. I needed to make more progress. At the current pace things were going, I wasn't sure I'd be able to survive.</p>, <p>....I needed to pick up the pace.</p>, <p>\"Make sure you don't lose it. I'm only lending the manual to you for now. Once you memorize it, I would need you to give it back to me. The Institute... Is rather strict about these kinds of things.\"</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>I quietly nodded my head before asking,</p>, <p>\"Is there anything else that you need me for?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...\"</p>, <p>\"You can go.\"</p>, <p>Delilah dismissed me while unwrapping the chocolate bar and eating it.</p>, <p>I stood up from my seat and lowered my head slightly.</p>, <p>\"....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>But just before I left, my feet came to a pause and I hesitated.</p>, <p>\"Julien...?\"</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>Whatever.</p>, <p>Turning around, I pointed at my mouth.</p>, <p>\"Your mouth...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Clank--!</p>, <p>Staring at Julien's departing back, Delilah felt her lips twitch as she wiped them with a tissue.</p>, <p>She tossed the tissue to the side right after she was done.</p>, <p>Then, she closed her eyes.</p>, <p>'Have I done the right thing...?'</p>, <p>She was unsure. However, this was necessary. With time, it became clearer and clearer to her.</p>, <p>Julien...</p>, <p>Outside of the Emotive field, he wasn't very talented. A gap would form between him and the current cadets at the current rate that he was progressing.</p>, <p>He may have been able to stand out because of his strong mind and Emotive abilities, but how long could that last?</p>, <p>A month? Two months...?</p>, <p>He didn't have much time, and as someone who had personally vouched for his position, Delilah felt compelled to interfere a little.</p>, <p>A Blue-ranked manual wasn't much to the Academy. However, it was an important asset.</p>, <p>The manuals couldn't be read as many times as one pleased. A certain mana flow was imbued into the book which would decrease with each read.</p>, <p>It wasn't an infinite resource.</p>, <p>Unless someone wrote the manual again, it'd be gone forever. And the higher the rank of the book, the harder it was to create.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that books that were ranked higher than Green were so sparse.</p>, <p>Simply put, the demand for them was too high, and the supply was too low.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Drumming her fingers over her desk, Delilah closed her eyes. Even now, her mind wandered back to the tattoo on his arm.</p>, <p>The more she looked at him, the more confused she became.</p>, <p>'Is he an enemy, or an ally?'</p>, <p>There were signs that pointed him to be an enemy and signs that said otherwise.</p>, <p>Which one was the right sign?</p>, <p>Chewing on her thoughts, Delilah's eyes slowly opened.</p>, <p>\".....I'll only help you out this much.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>When I returned to my dorm, the first thing I did was sit down and open the book.</p>, <p>\"I'm supposed to do this, right...?\"</p>, <p>I placed my hand over the book and channeled my mana over it.</p>, <p>Swoosh.</p>, <p>A pathway appeared in my mind. Seventeen channels, all leading toward the abdomen where my mana core was. The area where my mana gathered.</p>, <p>'That's five more channels than before...'</p>, <p>I immediately put the manual into practice.</p>, <p>As expected, this was a lot better.</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>The notifications appearing in front of me served to prove that.</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>For every five minutes that I followed the channels, a new notification would appear.</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>It went on like this for precisely one hour until I could no longer continue and stopped.</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>My clothes were soaked and my breathing was rough. Even so... I could feel myself progressing. It was unlike anything I had experienced before.</p>, <p>I had managed to progress more in an hour than in the two weeks that I had been in this world.</p>, <p>\"A pity.\"</p>, <p>I wanted to continue practicing, but recalling Delilah's words, I knew that I had to stop.</p>, <p>Further than this and I was risking my life.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling of the room.</p>, <p>....I felt a little tired.</p>, <p>It had been a little more than two weeks since I had been in this world, and so much had happened.</p>, <p>It felt as though several months had passed when in reality, it was a lot less than that.</p>, <p>My mind was exhausted and I wanted a little break from everything. However, I knew that it was impossible.</p>, <p>Even now...</p>, <p>I was blindly chasing a goal I had no clue about.</p>, <p>The more time passed, the more confused I was. What exactly was I supposed to do? Did I just have to get stronger and slowly unravel the clues that were laid out?</p>, <p>My path...</p>, <p>It felt like a dark road with no end in sight.</p>, <p>I was just going on a blind, hoping that things would turn out for the best.</p>, <p>But that wasn't good enough.</p>, <p>I needed more.</p>, <p>\"But how...?

            "[<p>I sat frozen, staring at the window in front of me with wide-open eyes.

That was my main goal. I didn't quite understand the reasoning behind the task, or whether it was something I could trust, but to get answers, I needed to follow the quest.</p>, <p>Just what would happen when the game completion reached 100%?</p>, <p>Would I get to finally go back home...?</p>, <p>\"What happens if I fail?\"</p>, <p>There wasn't anything that indicated what would happen if I were to fail, but I could more or less guess.</p>, <p>「Game Over.」</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>The situation became even more confusing, but...</p>, <p>\"I need to try it.\"</p>, <p>I had to try it.</p>, <p>For the first time since entering this world, I finally had something to cling to.</p>, <p> A hope.</p>, <p>The dark path that I was following finally didn't seem as dark. I had finally found a path.</p>, <p>Whether it would lead to nowhere, I had no idea.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I had to follow it.</p>, <p>This was my commitment.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A few days passed since then. It was Friday, the end of the week.</p>, <p>Things had cooled down after the incident with the professor. The Institute had kept a 'hushed' stance on the situation, stopping all cadets from talking about it.</p>, <p>That wasn't the only thing that changed. Everyone, ranging from cadets to professors, was assigned to a psychiatrist.</p>, <p>「Given the tragic circumstances, the institute has mandated that all personnel and cadets undergo mental health assessments to ensure a situation like this does not happen again.」</p>, <p>Such was the announcement of the Professor in charge of today's lesson. His words instantly aroused a wave of groans with one in particular being louder than the others.</p>, <p>\"....This is bullshit.\"</p>, <p>That rough and unfiltered voice... I didn't need to turn around to know who it was.</p>, <p>\"Kiera Mylne.\"</p>, <p>The Professor sternly spoke. He appeared to be quite tall, with short brown hair framing his face, complemented by thin-framed glasses obscuring his green eyes. He was quite young, and his looks were on the good side.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>He didn't follow up from there, but the meaning behind his gaze was quite clear.</p>, <p>'Don't swear.'</p>, <p>\".....Tsk.\"</p>, <p>The class continued from there.</p>, <p>\"Everyone please get on your stations.\"</p>, <p>It was a peculiar class.</p>, <p>\"This over here is how you cook the Mandrigol. First, you cut its stomach open and remove its lungs. When you remove the organs make sure you remove the gall bladder.\"</p>, <p>The name of the class was 「Culinary Guidance」and it focused on teaching the cadets about the monsters in the mirror dimension and how to prepare them.</p>, <p>\"You must remove it as it is highly poisonous to us.\"</p>, <p>Perhaps it was because I had been taking care of myself and my brother for as long as I could remember, I was able to follow the class smoothly.</p>, <p>Tak, tak—</p>, <p>The knife effortlessly sliced the stomach of the creature set in front of me.</p>, <p>It was hard to describe. It appeared notably furry, with two of its eyes extending upwards from their sockets. Below, two long legs were aligned, and it appeared to have no eyes.</p>, <p>In short, it didn't look appetizing.</p>, <p>\"Make sure you don't throw away the eyes. They're packed with nutrients and can be dried for rations later on in your journey in the mirror dimension.\"</p>, <p>But I still followed the Professor's instructions to a 'T'.</p>, <p>Guiding my knife around the eyes, I smoothly removed them from the creature and placed them in a nearby bucket.</p>, <p>\"When you cut, you must make sure to cut it into equal pieces...\"</p>, <p>Tak, tak—</p>, <p>It was weird, but I felt strangely at home.</p>, <p>This wasn't any harder than the things I had been cooking back at home when it was just me and my little brother.</p>, <p>Slicing the pieces into equal portions, I looked around me to see that I was the only one that was capable of following along with the instructions.</p>, <p>\"Professor can you slow down...\"</p>, <p>\"....I cut it too short. What do I do?\"</p>, <p>\"Damn it.\"</p>, <p>Even Aoife appeared to be struggling as her eyes were knit together tightly.</p>, <p>\"Okay, here's the next step. Once you're done cutting the Mandrigol into pieces, place it in the pot in front of you and let it boil in the soup. It's a very tough meat, so we must cook it on a low burn.\"</p>, <p>The Professor then proceeded to place the filets into a large pot in front of him. I also had one, and it had been put on simmer since the start of the lesson.</p>, <p>I had already put the necessary ingredients beforehand so all that was left was...</p>, <p>Plo Plop—!</p>, <p>Chucking the fillets into the pot.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>\"Done.\"</p>, <p>I patted my hands in satisfaction. I felt a strange sense of accomplishment out of this.</p>, <p>\".....Alright! It will take approximately until the end of the lesson for the meat to become tender. For those who are finished, please clean up your stations and wash up your dirty dishes.\"</p>, <p>The Professor's gaze wandered around before eventually falling on me.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>That was when I understood.</p>, <p>I was the only one that had managed to keep up.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Simmer~</p>, <p>Aoife stared at her pot and swallowed her saliva. The water bubbled, and the pieces of the Mandrigol floated at the top.</p>, <p>It wasn't the first time she had eaten the 'Mandrigol'.</p>, <p>While not a rare delicacy, it was still an 'infant' ranked beast. With several noticeable health benefits such as the cleansing of impurities, it was a staple food amongst the population of the Empire.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Plo Plop—!</p>, <p>'I can eat this?'</p>, <p>Aoife secretly swallowed. She had followed the instructions to perfection, so logically yes, but...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She closed the lid.</p>, <p>'Maybe not.'</p>, <p>It didn't look that appetizing.</p>, <p>Aoife looked around her. All the cadets were still busy cutting the Mandrigol. Only a few were done with that part and were now placing the cuts inside of the pot.</p>, <p>All with the exception of one.</p>, <p>'....It's you again.'</p>, <p>He was done a lot faster than them. Nine minutes faster to be exact. The gap between him and the rest was evident, and Aoife felt herself frowning at the thought.</p>, <p>'Why is he so good at everything..?'</p>, <p>In the time that she had spent at the Academy, he had beaten her in almost everything besides the magic and physical score.</p>, <p>There was a gap between them in that matter but...</p>, <p>'He's an Emotive Mage.'</p>, <p>It made sense for him to lag in such matters when he was so proficient in such a field. It was a frustrating thought, but he was... competent.</p>, <p>The thought made her competitive spirit flare up.</p>, <p>'...He may have been faster, but that doesn't mean it's better.\"</p>, <p>Yeah.</p>, <p>Speed wasn't important. What was important was taste.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The image of the contents in her pot flashed in her mind and her blank expression cracked.</p>, <p>Aoife looked around. Julien was still away washing the dishes, and so was the Professor who went out to get a new supply of Mandrigol for the students who failed to cut it on the first try.</p>, <p>A thought struck her.</p>, <p>Just maybe...</p>, <p>\".....Just a little taste.\"</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>She just wanted to check if he had seasoned properly.</p>, <p>Making sure that there was no one paying attention to her, she carried a few trays with her and moved toward Julien's desk.</p>, <p>It was on the way to the cleaning station outside and just a few steps away from her station...</p>, <p>She could play this out well.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her steps stopped at the station. It was clean with the only thing left being the pot and the stove.</p>, <p>Pursing her lips, she looked around before carefully opening the lid of the pot.</p>, <p>Plo Plop—!</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>A nice aroma wafted through the moment she opened the lid and her brow twitched.</p>, <p>\"It can—\"</p>, <p>\"What are you doing?\"</p>, <p>A cold voice echoed from behind her and Aoife almost flinched. Thankfully, she was able to keep herself composed and turned around.</p>, <p>Platinum long hair, deep red eyes, and a gaze that was filled with nothing but contempt.</p>, <p>With a look that suggested she had caught a rat, Kiera smirked.</p>, <p>\".....Are you trying to sabotage the competition?\"</p>, <p>She didn't even try to hide the disdain in her voice.</p>, <p>\"You haven't changed, have you? You're still the same. Whenever someone better than you appears, you try to put them down. Aren't I right?\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned.</p>, <p>'What is she on about?'</p>, <p>She couldn't understand what she was talking about. And perhaps noticing her confusion, Kiera suddenly smirked while shaking her head.</p>, <p>\".....Fucking bitch. You never change.\"</p>, <p>Aoife's face turned cold.</p>, <p>\"What did you call me?\"</p>, <p>\"A. Bitch.\"</p>, <p>Kiera emphasized while leaning her head closer.</p>, <p>\"What? Is the sheltered Princess angry?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A small crack appeared on Aoife's blank expression.</p>, <p>\"You think I wouldn't call you out on your shit? That I would just let you do whatever the fuck you wanted just because you're the fucking princess?\"</p>, <p>The cracks on her face became larger. Her well-maintained facade was slowly crumbling...</p>, <p>\"Still nothing?\"</p>, <p>Kiera's eyes squinted as her smirk became more prominent.</p>, <p>\".....Pathetic.\"</p>, <p>Aoife clenched her teeth and her expression almost crumbled. However, with the little rationality she had left, she turned to look away from her and focused her attention back on the pot.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, she didn't feel like tasting it anymore.</p>, <p>She was just about to close the lid when a finger poked into the soup.</p>, <p>\"Oh? It's not bad.\"</p>, <p>Licking her lips, Kiera looked at Aoife before taking the salt and sprinkling it over the soup.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened and she looked back.</p>, <p>\"It's missing a little salt.\"</p>, <p>\".....Stop it.\"</p>, <p>Her hand reached for the salt, but Kiera deftly avoided her and continued to sprinkle it.</p>, <p>\"Or what?\"</p>, <p>\"It's not my soup.\"</p>, <p>\"So? I'm just helping a classmate out.\"</p>, <p>\"Stop it.\"</p>, <p>Aoife's voice grew cold but that only served to encourage Kiera who doubled down on the salt.</p>, <p>First the middle finger on the first day then this...</p>, <p>Aoife found her patience running thin. Her mana flowed and Kiera's hand stiffened.</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>Unbothered by the look she was receiving, Aoife reached out for the salt when...</p>, <p>\"Kkh...!\"</p>, <p>Her 'Telekinesis' shattered and Kiera's hand swung in the air.</p>, <p>\"Fucking bitch. Who told you that you cou—\"</p>, <p>Plop—!</p>, <p>Her words were broken by an abrupt 'plopping' sound and the two of them stiffened on the spot.</p>, <p>Especially Aoife who found her mouth opening at the sight.</p>, <p>\".....Oh.\"</p>, <p>A single word came out of her lips. When she looked up again, she found Kiera standing rigidly by her side.</p>, <p>A cold voice followed a few seconds after.</p>, <p>\"....What are you doing here?\"</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>For a brief moment, Aoife panicked.</p>, <p>\"Your food... It was overflowing.\"</p>, <p>\"Overflowing?\"</p>, <p>Julien's gaze latched onto her and Aoife felt her mouth go dry. Eventually, though, he turned his gaze away and focused it on the pot.</p>, <p>His nose wrinkled at the sight of the soup.</p>, <p>Aoife's face tightened.</p>, <p>\"Where is the salt?\"</p>, <p>His gaze wandered back to her and she almost flinched. Thankfully, she was quick-witted.</p>, <p>\"Kiera borrowed it.\"</p>, <p>She pointed at Kiera and threw her under the bus. Feeling her finger, Kiera opened her eyes to rebuke but ultimately stopped and nodded.</p>, <p>\"You were done, so...\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>The two simultaneously sighed in relief at that moment and Kiera glared at Aoife who silently felt the corner of her lips pull.</p>, <p>Throwing her under the bus like that… It felt strangely nice.</p>, <p>\"….Give it back to me when you're done.\"</p>, <p>\"Will do.\"</p>, <p>With a quiet nod, Julien shifted his attention back to the pot. What he didn't notice was the sudden change in Aoife and Kiera's expressions.</p>, <p>\"It should be ready.\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Especially when he picked up the spoon by his right.</p>, <p>Unable to notice anything out of the ordinary, Julien lifted the spoon to reveal a thick viscous brown liquid.</p>, <p>\"Looks good.\"</p>, <p>Aoife felt every part of her body grow tense. The same was true for Kiera whose entire face was twitching.</p>, <p>And then, under the horrified eyes of the two of them…</p>, <p>Julien brought the spoon to his mouth.</p>, <p>\"....Um!\"</p>, <p>His expression immediately shifted the moment the spoon touched his mouth and his head flicked their way. A strange tension lingered over the area they were in as his voice, colder than it usually was, asked,</p>, <p>\".....Did you do something to the soup?\"</p>, <p>\"No…\"</p>, <p>\"No.</p>, <p>The two of them shook their heads at the same time though their refusal sounded anything but convincing.</p>, <p>Even so…</p>, <p>\"Is that so?\"</p>, <p>Strangely, Julien didn't seem all that bothered.</p>, <p>Putting the spoon down, he frowned. It was as if he was undecided about something.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>Just when the two of them were fearing for the worst, they heard his soft mumble,</p>, <p>\"....Since when was I such a good cook?\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was a dilemma. Staring at the soup in front of me, I looked back at Aoife and Kiera, who seemed strangely stiff.</p>, <p>'Did they really do nothing to the soup....?'</p>, <p>I brought the spoon to my mouth and closed my eyes. My tonsils danced at the rich taste that invaded my tongue, and I found myself quietly nodding.</p>, <p>It tasted phenomenal.</p>, <p>To the point where I couldn't help but mumble to myself.</p>, <p>\".....Since when was I such a good cook?\"</p>, <p>While I didn't think I was bad, I had never made something so good.</p>, <p>Could it be because of the ingredients?</p>, <p>Was that what it was?</p>, <p>\"Y-you think it's really good...?\"</p>, <p>Kiera stuttered from the side, and I frowned. What's wrong with her? Perhaps noticing my expression, she forced a smile and turned back.</p>, <p>\"Ah, anyway. Thanks for the salt.\"</p>, <p>She proceeded to head back to her station. That was when I felt another gaze.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I turned to look at Aoife, who was staring back at me. Her expression was hard to read, but for a brief moment, I thought I saw 'disbelief' in her gaze.</p>, <p>What sort of...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Picking up her trays, she left without saying another word. I stared at her back for a brief moment before shrugging my shoulders.</p>, <p>I really couldn't understand her.</p>, <p>Staring at her back for a brief moment, I turned my attention back to my pot and had another taste.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>I smacked my lips together and frowned.</p>, <p>\"....It's good.\"</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"It's missing something.\"</p>, <p>What exactly? I thought for a moment before coming to a conclusion.</p>, <p>\"It needs more salt.\"</p>, <p>The taste was a little too mild. Possibly sweet. It needed a little bit more salt.</p>, <p>I reached to my left, where the salt was, but I grasped nothing but air. I was confused at first, but then I remembered.</p>, <p>\"Ah, right.\"</p>, <p>Kiera had taken the salt.</p>, <p>I turned to look at her, and our eyes met. She raised her brow.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\".....The salt.\"</p>, <p>I pointed at the one she had on her desk.</p>, <p> \"...!\"</p>, <p>\"Can I have i—</p>, <p>Clank, Clank, Clank—!</p>, <p>I was interrupted by a loud noise. When I turned to look, I saw Aoife standing with all the trays on the floor. Her otherwise blank expression showed signs of breaking as her eyes widened.</p>, <p>What...?</p>, <p>She wasn't the only one who was behaving oddly.</p>, <p>Just as I turned my head, I heard Kiera's low mutter.</p>, <p>\"...Lunatic.\"</p>, <p>She was also looking at me with wide eyes.</p>, <p>\"Fucking lunatic.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>When I woke up, it was Saturday morning. In a daze, I remained on the bed and stared at the ceiling. I finally had a day to myself...</p>, <p>It was hard to describe how I currently felt. The days had been so hectic that every single day felt like they lasted a year.</p>, <p>But today was different...</p>, <p>There was nothing on my schedule today.</p>, <p>Finally, I could take a much-needed break.</p>, <p>Let's take a shower.</p>, <p>Shaaa—</p>, <p>I needed something to wake my groggy mind. The cold water was especially useful, as I felt refreshed coming out of the shower.</p>, <p>There was nothing better than a cold shower in the morning to refresh my mind.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I looked at my wet body in the mirror.</p>, <p>It was chiselled to perfection, and there seemed to be no scars or imperfections. My shoulders and biceps were quite large, while my abdominal muscles were finely sculpted, and my thighs felt as solid as rock.</p>, <p>I had always wanted this type of body in my previous life. I would always tell myself to go to the gym on a daily basis, but I would stop with some sort of nonsensical excuse. The longest I had ever lasted at the gym was two months.</p>, <p>Seeing no progress in the mirror, I lost all motivation and just gave up.</p>, <p>But things were different now.</p>, <p>I touched my body.</p>, <p>With how hard I was training at the moment, I could easily maintain this body. Not only that, but it could probably get even better in the future.</p>, <p>\"A pity it isn't my real body.\"</p>, <p>It was still hard for me to fully associate myself with this body. However, I was slowly getting there.</p>, <p>Even so...</p>, <p>\"When I return, I'll get my old body back...\"</p>, <p>I was merely rumbling at this point. The reality was that I wasn't sure if I could go back or not. No sign pointed out to that fact.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>I had to cling to this idea. It was the only thing that kept me going. If I were to learn that I couldn't go back, then...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>Opening them again, I leaned forward to stare at my reflection.</p>, <p>\".....I will be going back.\"</p>, <p>After drying my body, I went on to sit on the couch. Basking the sun's glow, I mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Status.\"</p>, <p>— ●[Julien D.

The first one was through the scriptures and manuals.

Confused, I turned it on and loaded the message.</p>, <p>[Julien Evenus, Leon Ellert, Aoife Megrail... May the following cadets show up at the entrance of the Institute in an hour.]</p>, <p>It was a message from the Institute board.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>[Congratulations. You have all been selected for the upcoming Draft Selection inauguration. An instructor will guide the following students to the ceremony that will take place in Lens. Kindly make yourself available.]</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I continued to stare at the message with a blank look before turning off the device and sitting down.</p>, <p>I opened my mouth, but no words came out.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Eventually, I lowered my head and stayed silent.</p>, <p>In the silence that took over the room, I closed my eyes and pursed my lips.</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 2.

I was in no mood for anything. But that seemed to be the case for him as well.</p>, <p>In the silence, we walked towards the entrance of the Academy.</p>, <p>When we reached the place, ten people were already waiting for us at the entrance.</p>, <p>...With eleven names on the list, we were essentially the last to arrive.</p>, <p>\"You two are finally here.\"</p>, <p>At the forefront stood someone I found somewhat familiar. With a thick, long red beard and a muscular physique, he was Professor Chambers, one of the examiners from my examination day and a High-Wizard.</p>, <p>\"Hurry up, you two. The train to Lens will depart in ten minutes. You will be held responsible if we miss the train.\"</p>, <p>His rough voice echoed throughout as I picked up the pace, slightly...</p>, <p>Honestly, I wouldn't mind missing it.</p>, <p>The Professor continued,</p>, <p>\"As many of you know, there will be a Draft at the end of the year. The six best cadets from each year will be chosen to represent the Institute at such an event. You all must take this seriously.\"</p>, <p>Squinting his eyes, I felt his gaze pause on me.</p>, <p>\"The ten of you are the most promising cadets that we currently have in our first years. Some of the most promising we've had in decades, and it is therefore extremely important that you carry yourself in a manner fitting of your status.\"</p>, <p>I then finally realized why he was looking at me. Taking a step closer, we were only a few steps away from each other. Placing his hand on my shoulder, he looked at me seriously.</p>, <p>\"As the Black Star, you will be the center of all attention and the group's leader. I need you to carry yourself as such. Is that understood?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence without saying a single word.</p>, <p>\"Cadet?\"</p>, <p>Only when he called me again did I raise my head.

            "[<p>It was just as the Professor was talking to me that it happened.</p>, <p>'Uh....?'</p>, <p>The world froze, and my vision turned dark. All of a sudden I lost control of my body.</p>, <p>It was a sensation I was all too familiar with...</p>, <p>'Another vision?'</p>, <p>The scenery shifted, enveloping me in the opulent embrace of a grand hall. Its lavish decor was blinding with all sorts of individuals present.</p>, <p>Such grand hall was silent.</p>, <p>It was as if the sound had been sucked out of the room.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>All eyes seemed to be focused on a certain spot. Or more specifically, towards two people.</p>, <p>\".....We've found it.\"</p>, <p>A towering figure with slender facial contours, jet-black hair, a long nose, and bushy eyebrows peered down at his palm, where a small transparent orb, reminiscent in size of a glass pebble, rested.</p>, <p>'What's that...?'</p>, <p>There was something about the pebble that seemed intriguing. It had a strange allure to it. Almost as if it was beckoning me to take it.</p>, <p>But I had no time to dwell on it as the next set of events continued.</p>, <p>\"Why did you steal it?\"</p>, <p>The man's voice thundered down towards the other individual, a woman adorned with cascading violet locks and piercing blue eyes. She returned his gaze with a frozen look.</p>, <p>Her eyes trembled, and so did her body...</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>He raised his hand to display a black purse.</p>, <p>\"This is yours isn't it?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's expression remained locked in a state of disbelief, her mouth opening and closing repeatedly in a futile attempt to articulate her words.</p>, <p>\"No, I...\"</p>, <p>\"There's no denying your crime.\"</p>, <p>He coldly cut her off.</p>, <p>\"We've searched everyone and you were the only one that was found with this. Do you think you can talk your way out of this?\"</p>, <p>He didn't seem interested in her ramblings. Coldly turning his gaze away from her, he looked toward the guard's station nearby.</p>, <p>\"Take her in for questioning.\"</p>, <p>\"No, wait...!\"</p>, <p>The guards latched onto her arms from both sides.</p>, <p>\"This is a mistake...!\"</p>, <p>She tried to protest, but it was to no avail.</p>, <p>\"That's not mine! I don't know where it came from! This is a....\"</p>, <p>Under the scrutiny of all present, Evelyn was forcibly escorted by the guards out of the hall. Her eyes searched the entire hall, eventually falling on me.</p>, <p>Me...?</p>, <p> 'Help me...'</p>, <p>Is what her gaze tried to imply.</p>, <p>I stood rooted to my spot, transfixed by her desperate expression, unable to tear my gaze away.</p>, <p>It sealed itself into my mind until the very end.</p>, <p>When her figure finally disappeared.</p>, <p>The vision ended there.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence without saying a single word.</p>, <p>\"Cadet?\"</p>, <p>Only when I heard the sound of the Professor's voice did I finally raise my head. A screen appeared shortly after.</p>, <p>[ ◆ Side Quest Activated: Unmask the Fraud.]</p>, <p>: Character Progression + 5%</p>, <p>: Game Progression + 1%</p>, <p>Failure</p>, <p>: Calamity 3 + 5%</p>, <p>\"Did you understand what I said?\"</p>, <p>The Professor's voice started to sound irritated, and I quietly nodded my head. I couldn't focus on him at the moment.</p>, <p>The only thing that was in my mind was the vision.</p>, <p>'....So the quest is about exposing who the real thief is?'</p>, <p>Or was it to prevent Evelyn from finding herself in such a situation? Either way, I now knew who 'Calamity 3' was. It was Evelyn.</p>, <p>That only left me with Calamity 1 and Calamity 2.</p>, <p>Who they were... I was still unsure yet. However, given time, I knew I'd be able to piece it all together.</p>, <p>\"Follow me in a single line. The train will be here shortly.\"</p>, <p>I once again looked up and saw that the other cadets were moving along. I picked up my pace and followed them from behind.</p>, <p>My gaze unconsciously trained toward a swaying set of purple hair not too far from me.</p>, <p>I thought back to the expression she made back in the vision. The one that was filled with shock, and desperation.</p>, <p>A thought ran down my mind at that moment.</p>, <p>'...Why did she look at me of all people for help in the vision?'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The Draft.</p>, <p>An Empire-wide event was broadcast and displayed all over. The Draft took place every end of the year, selecting the top 60 cadets from all the major Academies within the Empire.</p>, <p>There existed fifteen Guilds within the Empire. All associated with the Royal family, they were the only organizations besides the Academies that granted entrance to the Mirror Dimension.</p>, <p>If one became affiliated with a Guild, they could enter the Mirror Dimension whenever they wanted.</p>, <p>The competition among the Guilds was harsh, and each year, the cadets were intensively scrutinized to determine who would be the first pick of the draft.</p>, <p>The benefits of becoming the first-ranked pick were rather obvious for all. With sign-in bonuses that eclipsed those of the other picks, every cadet looked forward to becoming the number one pick.</p>, <p>\"We have just passed Endson. We will be arriving at the station soon.\"</p>, <p>Professor Chambers informed all of us.</p>, <p>The City of 'Lens' was incredibly rich, with many different districts in place. Our current destination was 'Rudmon', the main commercial street of Lens.</p>, <p>It was the richest district and where the 'House of Picks' was located. An esteemed Auction House where the inauguration was going to take place.</p>, <p>Coming out of the train station, we strolled through the district, where magnificent streets lined with vendors on both sides greeted our eyes.</p>, <p>The House of Picks was located by the river that cut through the city. It therefore took us about ten minutes to get there from the train station.</p>, <p>A crowd had already formed at the entrance of the building. It was hard to see through the packed crowd, with reporters mingling among regular people. Thankfully, there was a separate area we could enter from.</p>, <p>\"Welcome to the House of Picks.\"</p>, <p>It was a middle-aged man with refined clothing that greeted us.</p>, <p>\"You must be the distinguished guests from Haven. We have already reserved a place for you.\"</p>, <p>He then proceeded to guide us toward a sizable room. I originally expected him to guide us toward the hall in the vision, but contrary to my expectations, we were guided toward a different place.</p>, <p>A private room of some sort.</p>, <p>'Wow.'</p>, <p>Coming into the room, I had to pause for a moment to admire the setting.</p>, <p>At the forefront of the room, a grand window greeted my sight, below which stretched a substantial stage adorned with hundreds of seats now filling with attendees. All of whom were wearing formal clothing, unlike the rest of us.</p>, <p>The scene below appeared chaotic unlike where we were.</p>, <p>\"The announcement will be made shortly.\"</p>, <p>The butler proceeded to say from the entrance of the room.</p>, <p>\"Please feel free to enjoy yourselves in this room for now. Once the announcement is over, we will invite you all to the main ceremony where you can interact with the other guests.\"</p>, <p>With a bow, he went on to talk with the Professor who had a few things to ask.</p>, <p>Only then did the other cadets finally start speaking again.</p>, <p>\"Wow, this room looks awesome.\"</p>, <p>\"Can we take this food?\"</p>, <p>Despite most of the participants being sons of high nobles, they still seemed somewhat excited about the situation.</p>, <p>Well, all besides a select few. Aoife, Kiera, and Leon were the exception as they immediately found a seat and sat down.</p>, <p>I thought about finding a seat as well when...</p>, <p>\".....Here.\"</p>, <p>Someone handed me a black book.</p>, <p>\"This is?\"</p>, <p>\"It's the shop list.\"</p>, <p>Shop list?</p>, <p>I blinked my eyes and looked to my right where a person stood. I had grown a little familiar with him. I didn't remember at first, but I couldn't forget about him after meeting him during the forest incident.</p>, <p>Had it not been for him, I would've been unable to prevent the incident.</p>, <p>Anders Lewis Richmond.</p>, <p>Ever since that incident, his attitude toward me underwent a complete change.</p>, <p>He no longer seemed confrontational; in fact, he appeared to be making an effort to foster a friendlier relationship with me.</p>, <p>I was put off at first, but seeing how his intentions weren't malicious, I let him be.</p>, <p>\"As you probably know, the House of Picks is actually a famous auction house. Although there is no auction today, the shop is still open. If you're interested in something, you can try buying it.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>I nodded slightly and opened the book.</p>, <p>'I wonder if there's anything I can buy...'</p>, <p>I was somewhat intrigued.</p>, <p>[Mana Association Green] — 50,000 Rend.</p>, <p>[Essence Awakenening Green] — 70, 000 Rend.</p>, <p>[Melton Mana Manual Green] — 120, 000 Rend.</p>, <p>'Holy fuck.'</p>, <p>My heart almost jumped at the sight of the prices.</p>, <p>The currency within this world was called 'Rend'. If I had to make a conversion rate compared to my old world, then it'd probably be 1 Rend for one Dollar...? The purchasing power seemed to be about the same.</p>, <p>....And just looking at the prices of the Green Ranked book, I knew that I had no business here.</p>, <p>I may have been the son of a noble, but the amount of money that I had didn't even come close to letting me purchase a Green-ranked book.</p>, <p>What sort of corruption was this...?</p>, <p>I immediately skimmed past the first few pages, but...</p>, <p>'100,000 Rend.... 1,000,000 Rend.... 17,000,000 Rend...'</p>, <p>The deeper I went, the more absurd the prices became. It was to the point where I was just scrolling through the book for the sake of wasting time.</p>, <p>As if I could afford any of this stuff.</p>, <p>That was until I found myself pausing toward a certain section.</p>, <p>[Metryl Bone] — 4, 320, 000 Rend.</p>, <p>A certain image captured my attention and my eyes widened.</p>, <p>'This is...'</p>, <p>It was only a picture, but the overlapped with the image in my mind.

            "[<p>A tall man stood on the stage.</p>, <p>His appearance grabbed the attention of all those presents.</p>, <p>--Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for coming to the inauguration of the 57th seventh draft.</p>, <p>As he spoke, his voice boomed throughout the grand hall. It silenced all the noise within the venue.</p>, <p>--It's with great pride that I stand before you as the announcer of today's event....</p>, <p>He went on with the introductions. Useless ramblings that went on for several minutes before the lights turned off. What followed after was silence as the noise ceased.</p>, <p>--We will now be introducing the fifteen Guilds.</p>, <p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh--!</p>, <p>Fifteen banners fell from the sides, all displaying different intricate patterns and colors.</p>, <p>Lights flickered, pointing toward each banner, displaying their extravagance for all to see.</p>, <p>They appeared finely crafted, adorned with intricate golden patterns, and fashioned from rare fabrics. The patterns and insignias appeared to be meticulously handcrafted, with each banner's design particularly unique standing out in one way or another.</p>, <p>On any normal occasion, I would've been intrigued by the events.</p>, <p>But....</p>, <p>'I can take it can I...?'</p>, <p>All I could think about was the quest. Or more specifically, the bone.</p>, <p>Just how much stronger would I become if I were to take the bone?</p>, <p>A human was only allowed to implant five bones into their body. Any more would be too dangerous.</p>, <p>However, from what I had read, after the integration of the bone, one would find their strength increasing and be granted an [Innate] ability that used to belong to the soul of the deceased beast.</p>, <p>....It was an extremely enticing opportunity, and I knew that I couldn't let it slip away from my grasp.</p>, <p>Especially given my current strength. I was in desperate need of something like that.</p>, <p>\"But what about the quest...?\"</p>, <p>Would it allow it?</p>, <p>The quest didn't specify what I needed to do. In my mind, what the quest demanded from was to expose the fraud and prevent Evelyn from reaching the scenario from the vision.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>There was nothing in the quest that suggested I couldn't take the bone.</p>, <p>...And it wasn't as if the quest could control me. Whether I chose to complete the mission or not, I had full freedom of choice.</p>, <p>Since that was the case...</p>, <p>Why couldn't I take the bone?</p>, <p>'I know who will have it. When she will have it. And how they find it.'</p>, <p>For what reason can I not find a way to take the bone for myself?</p>, <p>The more I thought about it, the more I felt my chest prickle.</p>, <p>Ah...</p>, <p>This sensation.</p>, <p>It threatened to consume my mind at any second. It was foreign at first, but it became clearer with the passing of time.</p>, <p>Greed.</p>, <p> Right, I was being greedy.</p>, <p>I was coveting something that shouldn't have been mine in the first place.</p>, <p>\"Heh.\"</p>, <p>For some reason, the thought made me want to laugh.</p>, <p>I thought about all the implications that my actions would have on the innocent workers and staff of the auction house. It pricked at my consciousness, but at the same time, I knew that I couldn't afford to be sentimental.</p>, <p>'Morality.'</p>, <p>I needed to throw it away.</p>, <p>I was no longer Emmet Rowe.</p>, <p>Morality was no longer a thing for me. While I had a few lines that I couldn't bring myself to cross, the rest... I had to throw them away.</p>, <p>I had sworn I'd do anything to become stronger and achieve my goal.</p>, <p>And....</p>, <p>Taking the bone... Knowing that it was something I could do, and would be instrumental for my goal...</p>, <p>I knew I had to do it.</p>, <p>Right...</p>, <p>Because in the end, I couldn't afford to miss such a chance.</p>, <p>For my sake.</p>, <p>I had to be greedy.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Ever since the start of the inauguration, Evelyn felt weird. It felt as though someone was watching her every movement. And yet, when she looked, all she saw was the empty space behind her.</p>, <p>'Is it just me...?'</p>, <p>She looked to her left and then right. Once she was sure there was nothing wrong, she returned her gaze back to the front.</p>, <p>Her eyebrows slowly came to a furrow.</p>, <p>She could've sworn she had felt something. And she usually was never wrong about these things.</p>, <p>Her senses were generally quite accurate.</p>, <p>\"Strange...\"</p>, <p>\"What is?\"</p>, <p>A dry voice reached her ears.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened at the sound of the voice and her head flicked to her right where a familiar figure was sitting.</p>, <p>\"Julien?\"</p>, <p>What is he...?</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>Her shock hardly lasted more than a couple of seconds before her face returned back to its normal icy one. It was a face she only displayed to those she deemed 'unfamiliar'.</p>, <p>Indeed, the current Julien was someone she was unfamiliar with.</p>, <p>\"I was getting a weird feeling before. I thought someone was watching me, but I didn't think it'd be you of all people.\"</p>, <p>Things were starting to make sense to her now. The strange sensation... It was him wasn't he?</p>, <p>He was the one that was looking at her. Or at least, that was Evelyn thought to be the case.</p>, <p>But then again, why would he even look at her now when he had hardly paid her any attention back at the Institute?</p>, <p>She had liked the way things were so why the sudden change?</p>, <p>Was she missing something?</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her thoughts were further reinforced by his silence, and she felt puzzled.</p>, <p>\"Is there something that you want to say?\"</p>, <p>\"Um?\"</p>, <p>Julien raised his brow and the two of them looked at each other.</p>, <p>Evelyn frowned.</p>, <p>\"You didn't come all the way here for nothing, right?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>He didn't bother answering her as he seemed lost in his thoughts. Evelyn found herself growing annoyed by his antics.</p>, <p>An image overlapped with his. It was a younger version of him. Unlike the current stoic expression he wore, he wore a look filled with nothing but disdain.</p>, <p>'Certainly, he's different from the past, but....'</p>, <p>Her mind was brought back to the memories of five years ago. It was a memory she could never forget. Regardless of how hard she tried, she couldn't forget. Even now, she could distinctly remember everything.</p>, <p>From the weather to the smells...</p>, <p>Everything felt vivid to her.</p>, <p>....And it was exactly because it felt so vivid that she couldn't find herself to see him differently.</p>, <p>'He's the same. He may act differently, but inside... He's the same.'</p>, <p>That's right.</p>, <p>She mustn't be fooled by how he was currently behaving. Five years may have passed, but what he had done that day...</p>, <p>'I won't be fooled.'</p>, <p>At that moment, Evelyn caught sight of Julien. Leaning against the chair, his lips gently pulled into what seemed to be a smile. Her expression hardened.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\".....It's nothing.\"</p>, <p>With a shake of his head, he gradually stood up.</p>, <p>\"I've already got what I wanted.\"</p>, <p>\".....?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn felt lost staring at him. What sort of game was he playing? She was just about to speak when his voice suddenly cut in.</p>, <p>\"Enjoy your evening.\"</p>, <p>\".....Ah.\"</p>, <p>He left shortly after that, leaving Evelyn unable to utter a single thing back.</p>, <p>In the end...</p>, <p>She hadn't figured out if he was truly the one that was looking at her.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'...She's being targeted.'</p>, <p>That was the conclusion that I came up with after talking to her briefly. I first drew up that conclusion from how she was behaving. Noticing how she'd turn her head to look around from time to time, I knew that something was up.</p>, <p>Would someone act like that unless they felt that something was off?</p>, <p>I would've normally not bothered, but superhumans tended to be a lot more accurate at judging these kinds of things.</p>, <p>It was highly likely that she was truly being watched.</p>, <p>....It was also for this reason that I initiated a conversation with her.</p>, <p>I needed to verify this conclusion. It was an important piece of information after all.</p>, <p>The end result...</p>, <p>'I thought someone was watching me, but I didn't think it'd be you of all people.'</p>, <p>She indeed felt like someone was watching her.</p>, <p>While it was indeed true that I was also watching her, that had only been from the point where she had started to act suspiciously.</p>, <p>Before that, I had been in my own thoughts. Thinking about the vision, and the quest. Only when I had digested everything did I turn my attention to her and notice her strange attitude.</p>, <p>In any case, I was now certain of a few things.</p>, <p>'The culprit might be someone from this room, and he's targeting her directly.'</p>, <p>I had been worried that in the vision she had merely been the 'culprit' out of bad luck.</p>, <p>That perhaps, whoever the thief was, made her the culprit simply because she was the easiest target to place the blame on.</p>, <p>If such a scenario were to be true, then I wasn't confident I could 'steal' the item.</p>, <p>Mainly because I couldn't guarantee the fact that I could act exactly as the version of me had in the vision. There was a real chance that someone else would've been used as a target instead of Evelyn.</p>, <p>All because of my actions in trying to interfere with the situation.</p>, <p>Some sort of butterfly effect...</p>, <p>But now that I was more or less sure that she was the intended target, I didn't need to worry about the vision changing too drastically.</p>, <p>The bone was going to be with her.</p>, <p>....And that was all the information that I needed to formulate a plan.</p>, <p>What I needed to do next was wait.</p>, <p>Wait for everything to begin.</p>, <p>When that happens...</p>, <p>'I'll take it all.'</p>, <p>Game progression, character progression, and bone...</p>, <p>\".....I'll take everything.\"</p>, <p>Such was how big my greed was.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Already writing the next chap. Will try my best to get it done soon. It's a very big chap.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>And with that, I will now be ending my speech. For any of you who are present, there will be an after-party that you may be able to attend.</p>, <p>The announcer's voice boomed, signaling the end of the ceremony. Just before he ended things, he made a small announcement.</p>, <p>—To the cadets who are present, take this chance to get acquainted with your competitors as well as get a better understanding of the fifteen major Guilds. It will be a great opportunity for you in the long term.</p>, <p>It was on that note that he finally left the stage and the hall erupted into a wave of applause.</p>, <p>Clap, clap, clap—!</p>, <p>Evelyn joined in the clapping, and just as Evelyn clapped once, the chair beside her skidded back.</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah? What? What's going on...?!\"</p>, <p>With visibly groggy eyes and messy hair, Kiera looked around in confusion. Then, seeing what everyone was doing, she joined in on the applause.</p>, <p>\"Fucking amazing speech!\"</p>, <p>Clap, clap, clap—!</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Evelyn watched the scene at a loss for words.</p>, <p>She had been sleeping, hadn't she...?</p>, <p>Kiera Mylne. Evelyn's thoughts about her were rather conflicted. On the one hand, she was extremely talented. Rivaling her in almost every category. The only thing that set her off was her personality.</p>, <p>Her words were crude, and she was too confronting. She treated everyone as though they were her enemy, and it was because of that that Evelyn found herself struggling to get along with her.</p>, <p>A bit disappointing considering her talent.</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>With a long sigh, she leaned back on the chair.</p>, <p>The watchful feeling had disappeared about halfway through the speech, and only then did she sigh in relief.</p>, <p>'So it really could've been him...'</p>, <p>Julien.</p>, <p>It had only been a few minutes after he left that she stopped feeling that way. Was it a coincidence...? Or was he truly the one who was keeping an eye out for her?</p>, <p>\"Ma'am. The afterpart will be held in the main hall. If you would please...\"</p>, <p>Disrupting her thoughts was the butler who carefully passed on the same message to all of those present. He proceeded to hand her her purse back.</p>, <p>\"If you keep going ahead, you will be able to find the entrance of the hall. There will be colleagues waiting for you there.\"</p>, <p>\"....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>Without thinking too much, she took the purse and proceeded to head out of the room and toward the main hall.</p>, <p>It was as the butler said.</p>, <p>All she had to do was keep going straight. With many of the guests heading the same way, it wasn't hard for her to reach the hall which was already packed with guests.</p>, <p>The grand hall bustled with activity as hundreds of guests mingled within. Butlers gracefully walked around, presenting silver trays laden with drinks and snacks. Among them, cadets her age strolled about, engaging in superfluous conversations with their peers.</p>, <p>The fake smiles, and fake laughs...</p>, <p>Evelyn could see it from a glance. Being the daughter of a Viscount family, she was used to such scenes. it was something that she had grown accustomed to.</p>, <p>But even so...</p>, <p>\"H-hu...\"</p>, <p>She felt her chest grow heavy. The very air around her felt suffocating, and breathing was starting to become difficult.</p>, <p> 'It's normal... I have to get used to this...'</p>, <p>Her social anxiety was acting up again. Pinching her hand, she bit on her lips and once again took in the fake expressions of all those around her.</p>, <p>It left a sour feeling in her heart.</p>, <p>Especially when...</p>, <p>\"Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Kylian J. Marlin. It's an honor to become acquainted with someone from Haven.\"</p>, <p>She was no different than them.</p>, <p>Putting on a smile, she returned the greeting.</p>, <p>\"The pleasure is mine.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and let the memories sink into my mind.</p>, <p>The faces, the time, the silence... I recalled everything before opening my eyes again. What greeted my sight was the same environment as the vision.</p>, <p>Things were slightly different as the events had yet to unfold, but everything was practically the same.</p>, <p>*Sip*</p>, <p>Taking a sip of my drink, I quietly watched my surroundings. It was hard to not stand out on such an occasion, with multiple individuals trying to strike up a conversation with me.</p>, <p>\"Hell—\"</p>, <p>\"Busy.\"</p>, <p>\"Nice to—\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>I thought about engaging with them for a short moment but decided otherwise.</p>, <p>Such fake pleasantries were meaningless to me.</p>, <p>All I cared about was my greed. I needed to quench it. The idea of not being able to quench it seemed to eat at me.</p>, <p>The bone...</p>, <p>'I have to have it.'</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and took another sip.</p>, <p>'I've got 30 minutes left... The event in the vision plays at 8:03 P.M.'</p>, <p>There was a massive clock by the wall. It was thanks to it that I was able to know the exact time the event was going to start.</p>, <p>However, the vision started after the search. Meaning that the event started slightly before 8:03 P.M.</p>, <p>In my estimate, taking into account that everyone had to be checked, my estimate was ten minutes.</p>, <p>The event...</p>, <p>It was going to start in ten minutes.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>I felt a strange sense of nervousness all of a sudden.</p>, <p>I was taking a big risk. There was a chance that my actions would lead to me becoming what became of Evelyn in the vision. A criminal.</p>, <p>The thought made me realize.</p>, <p>.....I was walking on thin ice.</p>, <p>My heart quickened and my palms felt sweaty. Nervousness finally started to settle within me. However, I was quick to push it down.</p>, <p>Since the moment that I had appeared in this world, I had been walking on thin ice.</p>, <p>My situation was no different than it had always been.</p>, <p>If anything, I had gotten better at walking in such a situation. My worries... They were meaningless.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I shifted my attention away from my drink and back into the hall. My eyes wandered around until they found a set of familiar purple hair.</p>, <p>Surrounded by over three different people, she casually conversed with them.</p>, <p>\"Does she have it, or not...?\"</p>, <p>There was no way I could confirm this unless I directly checked her purse. But that in itself was a risk.</p>, <p>What if she didn't have it in the purse just yet?</p>, <p>I checked the time.</p>, <p>7:45 P.M.</p>, <p>I started to move.</p>, <p>Wherever I walked, I felt gazes directed my way. I let them be and continued forward.</p>, <p>\"I'm envious of your talent. Surely, you'll be able to rank high in the draft at the end of the year. I hope that I too will reach a high rank.\"</p>, <p>\"When you become successful, make sure you don't forget me.\"</p>, <p>\"....I won't.\"</p>, <p>I only stopped when I found a familiar back. The conversation died, and all eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>\"Julien...?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn seemed especially shocked by my appearance. I glanced at the people gathered around her before returning my attention.</p>, <p>\"I need to talk to you.\"</p>, <p>As if I had said the most shocking thing, her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I continued to stare at her silently. Eventually, she pursed her lips and nodded her head. With a polite smile, she dismissed the cadets around her before following me toward a more secluded part of the hall.</p>, <p>She was the first one to break the silence.</p>, <p>\"....I didn't need saving.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Saving?</p>, <p>From what?</p>, <p>She frowned and insisted.</p>, <p>\"Really.\"</p>, <p>I became even more confused but nodded.</p>, <p>\"If you say so.\"</p>, <p>I thought she would be satisfied with that, but it only deepened her frown.</p>, <p>\"You're wrong. I really didn't need you to save me. I could've handled the situation well...\"</p>, <p>I continued to nod along.</p>, <p>\"Sure.\"</p>, <p>\"You, you...\"</p>, <p>But it seemed it only irritated her further. Clenching her teeth, she looked around before leaning closer to whisper.</p>, <p>'I no longer have social anxiety. I've fixed that five years ago. I'm no longer the same person. Don't misunderstand...'</p>, <p>\"Oh, okay.\"</p>, <p>Social anxiety?</p>, <p>That was a new piece of information to me.</p>, <p>Still, seeing her so desperately trying to justify herself before me felt rather funny. For a moment, I almost lost my composure and laughed.</p>, <p>But as I reminded myself of the situation, I recomposed myself and looked toward her purse.</p>, <p>\"Your purse. Care to open it up?\"</p>, <p>\"I swear, I real—Uh?\"</p>, <p>She blinked several times. Then, as if processing my words, her expression crumbled. I stopped her before she could say anything.</p>, <p>\"You were right. Someone was watching you.\"</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>Her expression changed.</p>, <p>\"Be subtle when opening your purse. It's probably hidden somewhere, but it's there.\"</p>, <p>\"What is...?\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer and moved closer, using my back as some form of shield.</p>, <p>\"Be quick.\"</p>, <p>\"You, what—\"</p>, <p>\"Check.\"</p>, <p>I cut her off again. Her expression changed yet again, but as if noticing the seriousness in my tone, she lowered her head and subtly opened her purse.</p>, <p>\".....Fine.\"</p>, <p>As she gritted her teeth, she added.</p>, <p>\"But if there's really nothing, see what I'll do to you.\"</p>, <p>A strange silence took over our area as Evelyn rummaged through her purse. Seconds ticked, and she had continued to rummage through.</p>, <p>I felt my chest heave with unease with each second that passed. Doubtful thoughts started to cross my mind.</p>, <p>'Is it really going to be there?'</p>, <p>'....What if it's not there?'</p>, <p>'Was I too hasty? Should I have waited more...?'</p>, <p>\"Ah—\"</p>, <p>Such thoughts were broken by a strange noise that came out of Evelyn's mouth, when I looked down, I saw her holding a familiar orb.</p>, <p>My mind immediately raced at the sight of it.</p>, <p>'It's here...'</p>, <p>It had really happened.</p>, <p>\"W-what... This...\"</p>, <p>With a clear look of shock and disbelief, Evelyn held the orb in her hand. Her expression was reminiscent of the one she had made in the vision. However, ignoring it, I reached out for her hand and snatched it.</p>, <p>\"Hey, you...\"</p>, <p>\"Stay quiet if you don't want things to blow over.\"</p>, <p>\"Wha...\"</p>, <p>I looked around me. There were a few gazes on me. Some from cadets, and some from older gentlemen. I made sure to memorize the faces of each and every one that was looking at me.</p>, <p>Then, just as I was prepared to leave, a hand reached out to grab me by the arm and pulled me back.</p>, <p>\"I don't know what's going on, but it's best if you had that over to the sta—\"</p>, <p>\"It's already too late for that.\"</p>, <p>I nudged my chin toward the distance. Several guards were already starting to show strange movements.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Her grip loosened from there.</p>, <p>I thought she'd let go of me from that point, but just when I thought I could move, her grip once again tightened.</p>, <p>\"....About what I said before. I really don't have social anxiety.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>\"You, why don't you believe me?\"</p>, <p>\"I believe you.\"</p>, <p>Her expression contorted, but she eventually let me go. I silently shook my head before moving away from her.</p>, <p>There was still one thing left that I needed to do.</p>, <p>But I didn't have much time left.</p>, <p>The guards were already showing signs of movement, and with the bone on me, I knew that if I failed on my next step, I was done for.</p>, <p>Therefore, I hurried my steps.</p>, <p>Gradually, a figure appeared in the distance. He was talking with several people and held a rather lofty position.</p>, <p>He stood tall with skinny facial contours, jet-black hair, a long nose, and bushy eyebrows.</p>, <p>A face that I couldn't forget even if I wanted to.</p>, <p>As his voice boomed down, forcing down judgment on Evelyn, I had a hard time forgetting his face.</p>, <p>Since coming to the decision to take the bone for myself, there was one part that I found particularly difficult to figure out.</p>, <p>How exactly would I be able to sneak the bone out of the venue?</p>, <p>With everyone being searched so thoroughly, how could it be possible for me to smuggle the bone out?</p>, <p>It was then that I had a sudden thought.</p>, <p>'.....Is everyone really going to be searched?'</p>, <p>Sure, he might be able to search every single person in the room, but in fact... there was one person he most likely wouldn't search.</p>, <p>Who exactly....?</p>, <p>Himself.</p>, <p>Right...</p>, <p>Because he knew that he wasn't the culprit.</p>, <p>'Haha.'</p>, <p>It was a daring idea. One that made me want to laugh at how ridiculous it was. But staring at the guards that were slowly starting to walk his way, I grabbed the nearest drink to me and approached.</p>, <p>I had just moved a few meters away from him, when...</p>, <p>\"Oh...!\"</p>, <p>Splash—</p>, <p>I suddenly tripped, spilling the drink all over him.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>As I glanced up, a pair of eyes met mine, their gaze bearing down on me. His black blazer was drenched, creating an eerie stillness in the surrounding space.</p>, <p>My face felt rigid, and my mouth moved soundlessly before finally finding my voice.</p>, <p>\".....I apologize. It was a mistake.\"</p>, <p>I was quick to react.</p>, <p>My initial action was to gently remove the drink from his grasp and set it down on the nearby table. Then, I retrieved a tissue and proceeded to delicately pat down his clothes.</p>, <p>\"....The ground was slippery, and--\"</p>, <p>\"It's fine.\"</p>, <p>He held out his hand to stop me and smiled. The tension that hung around the surroundings eased from that moment on.</p>, <p>Looking up to address the other present, he started to speak in a warmer tone.</p>, <p>\"It was an accident. There's no need for you to worry. The jacket isn't even that expensive.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, but at least let me repay you.\"</p>, <p>\"It's alright.\"</p>, <p>\"But--\"</p>, <p>\"This much is nothing. Please be at ease. I've long heard of your reputation. Take it as a token of friendship from me.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, but...\"</p>, <p>I insisted several times, but he refused me each time. In the end, I had no choice but to stop. I could more or less tell he was starting to grow annoyed by my responses.</p>, <p>Thankfully, he had managed to recognize my identity and wasn't overly harsh to me. Rather, he seemed keen on using the opportunity to build a connection with me.</p>, <p>There were perks to being the Black Star.</p>, <p>\"Be more careful next time.\"</p>, <p>\"....I understand.\"</p>, <p>I lowered my head to apologize again. Just as I did, the guards finally caught up to him and whispered something in his ear.</p>, <p>His expression shifted immediately.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>\"If you'll excuse me for a brief moment.\"</p>, <p>Under my watchful eyes, he picked up his glass and tapped it with his finger.</p>, <p>Ting--! Ting--!</p>, <p>The noise managed to reach the ears of all present.</p>, <p>The noise in the hall quieted down and all eyes fell on him.</p>, <p>Clearing his throat, he smiled.</p>, <p>\"Ladies and gentlemen, there seems to have been an accident.\"</p>, <p>His voice quietly traveled throughout the hall. With the same calming smile, he went on to explain the situation.</p>, <p>\"It's with regret that I have to inform you that one of the prized items of the auction house has been stolen. The reports have come just now, and we still believe that the culprit is hiding amongst one of us.\"</p>, <p>He went on to press his hand against his chest as his head lowered a little.</p>, <p>\"Therefore, I hope that with some understanding, you won't mind if we search all the guests present. I humbly ask as the Head Chief of the Auction House.\"</p>, <p> A strange silence followed shortly after before the entire hall erupted into noise.</p>, <p>\"A thief? If that's the case then I don't see why I should disagree. I've got nothing to hide.\"</p>, <p>\"Are you saying that you're going to keep us here until everyone is searched?\"</p>, <p>\"This... Is this even possible?\"</p>, <p>\"I refuse to be searched!\"</p>, <p>The response was a mix of protests and agreements. But it was only after the members of the fifteen Guilds came up to voice out their support that the noise died down.</p>, <p>\"We agree with the search.\"</p>, <p>\"We've got nothing to hide. Please don't mind us. Search as you want.\"</p>, <p>'....Has he bought them?'</p>, <p>Seeing the strange looks he was giving to the representative members of the Guild, it seemed like a plausible idea.</p>, <p>Or at least... The Auction House and the Guilds were on extremely good terms.</p>, <p>In any case, guards started to pour in from all entrances, blocking people from leaving.</p>, <p>Shortly after, someone came to my side.</p>, <p>\"Please.\"</p>, <p>The Head Chief concluded with another bow.</p>, <p>\"....Thank you for your understanding.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The search continued for the next half hour. Despite the many protests from the guests, and members of the Academies, they went to deaf ears and the search continued.</p>, <p>\"....How is the situation?\"</p>, <p>Overlooking the situation, the Head Chief frowned. It was taking a lot longer than he expected...</p>, <p>It couldn't be that the thief had escaped...?</p>, <p>But how was it possible? The moment the item had been stolen, all exits had been blocked and all the guests present had been kept.</p>, <p>The likelihood that the thief had escaped was slim...</p>, <p>\"Head Chief, we still have found nothing. Most of the guests are showing signs of dissatisfaction. Especially those that have been cleared of suspicions. We've also searched the surroundings and found nothing.\"</p>, <p>Frowning, the Head Chief massaged his chin.</p>, <p>\"How troublesome...\"</p>, <p>All guests had certain standings within the Empire. Their actions were the equivalent of offending such high-class people.</p>, <p>Thankfully, given their great relationship with the fifteen Guilds, the situation had not turned out for the worst, but...</p>, <p>For how long could he keep it like that?</p>, <p>If things progressed at this rate, then there was a chance that he might end up offending several big shots at once.</p>, <p>He had to hurry up. He didn't have much time. Though the item stolen was expensive and would lead to substantial losses, it was something he could take given the circumstances.</p>, <p>He'd much rather want to keep the guests happy than lose out on the money.</p>, <p>Money could always be made. Connections...?</p>, <p>That was much harder.</p>, <p>But of course...</p>, <p>If he could, he'd like to find the culprit. What sort of person would not care about catching the thief who had stolen from them?</p>, <p>'See what happens when I catch that bastard...'</p>, <p>His grip on his drink tightened at the thought.</p>, <p>However, if they still couldn't find the culprit before the situation turned out like that, he would have no choice but to give up.</p>, <p>\"Just where could it be...?\"</p>, <p>The Head Chief felt his head throb, and his head turned to face a young man not so far from where he was. He currently was getting his body checked, but from how the guards were responding, he didn't seem to be guilty.</p>, <p>Even so, seeing his face, the Head Chief silently clicked his tongue.</p>, <p>'.....An idiot.'</p>, <p>Such was his evaluation of the Haven Black Star.</p>, <p>Who would've thought he'd be such an idiot...? Recalling how his blazer had been smeared with his drink, the Head Chief felt his lips twitch.</p>, <p>The suit wasn't cheap. He had only lied to maintain his image.</p>, <p>It was in fact extremely expensive.</p>, <p>If it weren't for his position as the Black Star, then...</p>, <p>\"Um?\"</p>, <p>The Head Chief felt his hand suddenly pause and his expression changed.</p>, <p>He looked around him. All guards were busily checking patting down and checking the items of all guests present.</p>, <p>A sudden thought struck him then and he put the drink in his hand down.</p>, <p>The way he looked at the cadet near him changed as he tried to recall the incident. Out of nowhere, he had suddenly tripped over and spilled his drink on him. Thereafter, he went on to try to dry his clothes...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Blinking his eyes, he almost found himself laughing.</p>, <p>Right...</p>, <p>Of course.</p>, <p>Why didn't he think about it? Of all the people present, who was the most likely person to not get checked?</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>He laughed out loud then. Turning his attention towards one of the nearest guards, he extended his hands.</p>, <p>\".....Search me too.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>The guard seemed taken aback, but he didn't mind. Nudging with his chin, the Head Chief's gaze wandered back to the young man as his eyes narrowed.</p>, <p>If his guesses were correct, then...</p>, <p>He had found his culprit.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>The search took quite a while.</p>, <p>Patting down our bodies and using a strange item while doing so, it felt as though every part of my body was being checked. Most likely, the device helped to detect through the human flesh. In the off-chance the thief swallowed the item, then they'd be able to tell.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>My arms were pressed.</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>My legs were pressed.</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>My pockets were checked.</p>, <p>I remained silent the entire time and kept my heart beating at a steady state.</p>, <p>Especially when I felt a certain gaze directed toward me. I felt the back of my hair stand under such gaze.</p>, <p>My palms were sweaty and I had a strange urge to fidget my hand.</p>, <p>Even so, I kept myself from showing any noticeable reaction until the search was finally over.</p>, <p>\"It looks like you're good to go. Nothing has been found on you.\"</p>, <p>Only then did I finally step back. As I turned my head, I found myself locking eyes with another individual, causing a subtle tightening of my expression. He was looking at me with a gaze that seemed to say, 'I've got you...' I wondered what he was on about at first, but after seeing that he was also getting searched, I understood.</p>, <p>Ah--</p>, <p>I covered my mouth at that moment.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Swallowing my saliva, I forced myself to remain composed and stood still. My left hand twitched, and I wasn't able to stop my fingers from fidgeting together.</p>, <p>Such action was caught by his gaze as just faintly, the end of his lips curled.</p>, <p>\".....You, there.\"</p>, <p>Finally, he called out for me.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I didn't respond immediately and pursed my lips.</p>, <p>He nudged me with his finger.</p>, <p>\"Come here...\"</p>, <p>His voice came out dry and commanding.</p>, <p>I swallowed before following his instructions and moved near him, only stopping at the opposite end of the table where a drink filled with ice appeared.</p>, <p>I unconsciously reached out for it and he didn't stop me.</p>, <p>Rather, he seemed to enjoy my actions.</p>, <p>\"There's no need to be nervous.\"</p>, <p>His gaze wandered toward the guards that surrounded him as they were busily checking every part of his body.</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>They carried a similar procedure to the one like mine, patting his body all over and paying special attention to the blazer.</p>, <p>I felt my expression stiffen further as my grip on the glass tightened.</p>, <p>His voice once again reached me.</p>, <p>\".....Do you want to come clean?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I tilted my head and he leaned closer.</p>, <p>\"If you come clean now, the situation will end more nicely. I'm currently not accusing you because I have no evidence. However...\"</p>, <p>He suddenly smiled.</p>, <p>\"Even though you're trying your best, I can see just how nervous you are. If you just come cle--\"</p>, <p>\"Chief.\"</p>, <p>His sentence was abruptly cut off by one of the guards. As he looked to meet his gaze, his expression quickly changed the moment he spoke.</p>, <p>\"....There's nothing. You're also clear.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>As if not expecting such an answer, his eyes widened and his expression crumbled. I stared at the scene from the opposite side of the table before lowering my head to stare at my drink.</p>, <p>\"Are you sure there's nothing wrong? Did you check correctly...? I...\"</p>, <p>His voice faded in the background as I stared at the drink in my hand. Or more specifically, one of the 'ice cubes' inside.</p>, <p>It blended in so nicely...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I blankly stared at the cubes for a few more seconds before bringing the drink closer to my lips.</p>, <p>Gulp--</p>, <p>Fucking idiot.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>I once used to be a salesman.</p>, <p>\"Uh? Nothing...? Are you sure there's nothing?\"</p>, <p>Learning to be able to read, or predict the actions of individuals I knew nothing about was something that had been engraved in me since my work days.</p>, <p>.....Our job consisted of doing whatever was possible to convince an unknown party to purchase the product that we were selling.</p>, <p>All means to attract sales were considered usable in such an industry. Even if we ended up resorting to underhanded methods in the process.</p>, <p>It was thanks to such an environment that I was able to more or less predict how one would react given certain circumstances.</p>, <p>Who would've thought such a skill would come in handy in a different world?</p>, <p>\"We've checked again, there is really nothing.\"</p>, <p>\"Check again.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes...\"</p>, <p>I watched as the Head Chief patted his blazer and clothes in confusion.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stared at the scene in complete silence while swallowing the bone down my throat. It hurt a little, but I kept my expression firm and prevented myself from showing anything on the outside.</p>, <p>Having been cleared of all suspicion, I was now free to take the bone. I had been waiting for this opportunity from the start.</p>, <p>Since the beginning...</p>, <p>All of it had been flowing as I thought it would.</p>, <p>The way he behaved and reacted... It was in line with how I envisioned he'd act. And it made sense.</p>, <p>My actions...</p>, <p>They followed a certain sequence that prompted one to act in such a way.</p>, <p>What were the chances of me suddenly spilling the drink all over him before the guards suddenly came to alert him? Added to the fact that I was tapping his body in an attempt to 'dry' his clothes, it made sense for him to grow suspicious.</p>, <p>I wasn't naïve enough to think that the Head Chief would fall for such a simple trick. It would be a little too obvious.</p>, <p>Which was why I never intended his blazer to be my target.</p>, <p>From the start, all of it was a cover up for my real target.</p>, <p>*Sip*</p>, <p>'.....His drink.'</p>, <p>I swallowed and let the drink flow down my throat.</p>, <p>The 'bone' was the size of a small pebble, and while it wasn't completely transparent, it perfectly blended with the ice cubes within the red drink.</p>, <p>Unless one paid close attention to it, they wouldn't notice.</p>, <p>....And how would the Head Chief notice it when he was busy investigating the theft?</p>, <p>Diverting all my attention towards the jacket, I was able to slip the bone into his drink. As I said before, there was no better target than the Head Chief.</p>, <p>He may have had the guard check him after he recalled my actions, but unlike the other guests, where everything had been checked, from drinks to bodies, he only had his body checked.</p>, <p>It made perfect sense when taking into account that perhaps he hadn't even noticed his drink had been taken away by him in that instant that I spilled the drink over him.</p>, <p>Compared to how 'extravagant' the 'tapping' was in contrast to how I had taken the drink away from him, it was only natural that he didn't take it into consideration.</p>, <p>I had purposely diverted his attention away with my actions to make it slip his mind.</p>, <p>Sort of like how most magicians trick their audience in shows.</p>, <p> Only that, I was no magician.</p>, <p>\"Huuu...\"</p>, <p>I took a breath as I finally finished the drink in my hand and placed it down on the table again.</p>, <p>Even now, as I stared at it, I could see it trembling. The nervousness had been real, and even now I could feel the beat of my heart drumming in my mind.</p>, <p>In the end, while the plan was far from perfect, things panned out as I expected them to.</p>, <p>The bone. It was finally in my possession.</p>, <p>My plan had worked.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'It's not over yet.'</p>, <p>As I said before, I wanted everything. From quest to bone. So far, I have only managed to achieve two of the three things that I wanted.</p>, <p>There was one thing left for me to do.</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>I let out a small breath and closed my eyes.</p>, <p>'Unmask the fraud.'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"You're good to go. There is nothing on you.\"</p>, <p>\"....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn pursed her lips and took a step back. Her thoughts were in disarray, but she didn't show it outwardly.</p>, <p>All she could think of at the moment was Julien.</p>, <p>'Why...? Why did he do that?'</p>, <p>For what reason did he go out of his way to help her? It made no sense to her. It couldn't be because he still cared about her, right?</p>, <p>Evelyn swallowed and pursed her lips.</p>, <p>The idea seemed impossible, and she knew herself that it was impossible, and yet... Why did she continue to have such thoughts?</p>, <p>It was obvious why.</p>, <p>....It was because that was what she'd liked to believe. That perhaps, he wasn't the heartless monster that she had seen. That there was perhaps still something in his broken self.</p>, <p>Something that could still be salvaged.</p>, <p>\"Evelyn?\"</p>, <p>Her thoughts were broken by a quiet voice. When she turned around, Leon appeared, standing beside her.</p>, <p>He stood quietly with his gaze fixed on her.</p>, <p>\".....Are you okay?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Evelyn opened her mouth but found herself unable to say anything. She eventually lowered her head and nodded her head.</p>, <p>'I'm fine.'</p>, <p>Was what she was trying to imply with her actions.</p>, <p>Her odd behaviour didn't go unnoticed by Leon, who frowned at the sight of her and leaned his head forward.</p>, <p>\"What happened...?\"</p>, <p>\"No, it's—\"</p>, <p>\"What happened.\"</p>, <p>He cut her off decisively, leaving her with no room to say anything else. It was at that moment that Evelyn realized she couldn't fool him and bitterly smiled.</p>, <p>\"It's Julien...\"</p>, <p>She spoke slowly, keeping her head down.</p>, <p>\"Do you think he can be saved?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her response was met with silence. When she looked up, she was surprised to see Leon staring at her with a complicated expression.</p>, <p>Then, with a long sigh, he shook his head.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>He decisively said. Almost too decisively.</p>, <p>\".....He can no longer be saved.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn felt a little part of her tear. Especially when she noticed the strained expression on Leon's face as he talked about him.</p>, <p>\"....It's too late for that. The Julien you remember. That we remember. He's no longer in this world.\"</p>, <p>He paused before adding.</p>, <p>\"Think of him as a stranger.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>After another half hour elapsed and the guests' patience wore thin, the Head Chief decided to halt the investigation.</p>, <p>\"It appears we've detained you all for too long. My apologies for the inconvenience. Regrettably, we couldn't identify the culprit.\"</p>, <p>He announced, maintaining his professional demeanour.</p>, <p>With a slight bow, he went on to add,</p>, <p>\"As a token of apology, for all the guests that were inconvenienced by our actions, the auction will offer a 10% discount on any of the products available from us.\"</p>, <p>Only then did the people in the hall calm down. It had to be noted that a ten percent discount was a large sum of money given how expensive some of the items listed in the auction house were.</p>, <p>Such a reward was enough to wash all pent-up resentment away.</p>, <p>It was a small price the Head Chief was willing to pay in order to keep the people in the hall happy. A smile marred his features when he saw the pleased expressions of the guests, and only then did he finally allow for the guests to be escorted out of the premise.</p>, <p>\"Though the circumstances made the night sour, I hope you have all enjoyed yourselves. Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience.\"</p>, <p>One by one, the guests started to move out in an orderly line.</p>, <p>As the guests departed in an orderly procession, a man clad in a butler uniform joined the line, then discreetly veered off into a dim corridor.</p>, <p>Tok Tok—</p>, <p>His steps echoed throughout the otherwise quiet corridor as his calm expression changed.</p>, <p>\".....Failed.\"</p>, <p>The plan had failed.</p>, <p>The butler's expression distorted at the thought. How could the plan they had been working on for so long fail like that...?</p>, <p>Everything had been flowing smoothly up until the very last moment.</p>, <p>While he wasn't exactly sure about what had happened since he hadn't managed to see it, he more or less had an idea.</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>The Black Star.</p>, <p>He had interfered with their plans. It could only have been him.</p>, <p>'....I have to report this.'</p>, <p>The situation was serious. How did he find out about the plan? Why did he interfere? How much does he know...?</p>, <p>Tok Tok—</p>, <p>Questions continued to flood the butler's mind as he continued to move along the quiet corridor.</p>, <p>The plan...</p>, <p>It was supposed to be perfect.</p>, <p>For the Black Star to interfere in the matter suggested that there was a chance he knew something about them. And even if he didn't and had acted out of impulse, which seemed improbable given their investigation of him and his relationship with her... It was vital that he report the situation to the higher ups.</p>, <p>They couldn't allow for unknown variables to interfere with their plans.</p>, <p>Not when they were so close to accomplishing their goals.</p>, <p>\"Not y—Uh?\"</p>, <p>Mid-stride, the ground beneath him shifted abruptly, and unseen hands erupted from below, seizing his ankles in a tight grip.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!</p>, <p>In an instant, a wave of weakness swept through his body, causing his balance to falter.</p>, <p>\"What...\"</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>A single step shattered the silence as a dry voice cut in from behind him.</p>, <p>\"....Where do you think you're going?\"</p>]\n",

Thankfully, with everyone having moved toward the main hall after the incident, the area was still somewhat deserted.</p>, <p>\"Huuu...\"</p>, <p>Recomposing myself, I stood up and fixed my clothes. The entire time I kept my eyes lingering on the corpse.</p>, <p>If he wasn't dead before, I was sure he was now.</p>, <p>I imprinted the sight in my mind.</p>, <p>\"I killed him.\"</p>, <p>I told myself that.</p>, <p>It wasn't going to be the last time I would kill someone.</p>, <p>That much I knew, and understood.</p>, <p>Which was why I burned the image and emotions I was currently feeling in my mind.

I was just about to stand up when I noticed something and squinted my eyes. It was dark so I couldn't see properly.</p>, <p>But there was something that grabbed my attention.</p>, <p>I slowly rolled up the butler's sleeve to get a better look. When I did, my eyes widened and my heart, which had just steadied, jumped up.</p>, <p>A familiar tattoo. One that I had.</p>, <p>Four identical leaves.</p>, <p>All in black.</p>, <p>\"What is...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The journey back to Haven felt like a blur. None of the cadets spoke throughout the entire way back, and the Professor was busy handling reports and calls from the other Professor at the Academy to care about us.</p>, <p>I was fine with such development.</p>, <p>I was in no state to talk with anyone. The only thing in my mind was the image of the butler's tattoo.</p>, <p>Rolling up my sleeves, I stared at mine.</p>, <p>It was identical in every way. Perhaps, the only difference between my tattoo and theirs was that mine was glowing. At least to me. From an outsider's point of view, mine was also not glowing.</p>, <p>I was the only one that could see the glowing.</p>, <p>'What is the meaning of this....?'</p>, <p>A wave of questions flooded my mind. They just endlessly poured into my mind like the water from a broken dam.</p>, <p>What was the meaning of the tattoo and why did the butler have it? Was it some twisted coincidence and the two did not correlate...?</p>, <p>'As if.'</p>, <p>I wasn't naive enough to think that.</p>, <p>There was something more to it. I was sure.</p>, <p>'....But what exactly?'</p>, <p>He had died before I could find any information. I had been so shocked by the development that I had only snapped out of it when I heard the sound of footsteps coming from behind me.</p>, <p>Only then did I wake up and hide the body away before joining back with the group.</p>, <p>Thankfully, nobody asked about my whereabouts when I returned. I had only been gone for less than five minutes. It wasn't suspicious enough to gather their interest.</p>, <p>....And in some way, most didn't have the courage to ask.

Just what connection does it have with the one that I have?</p>, <p>It felt as though I had finally found something. An idea to chase after. Only for me to find that the path was just as dark as the other ones that I had been following.</p>, <p>'Just how would I be ab--Ah.'</p>, <p>It was at that moment that I recalled something.</p>, <p>A certain conversation I had a while back. In fact, there was someone else that knew about the tattoo.

His eyes fell on the naked corpse that lay in the middle of the table.</p>, <p>A middle-aged man wearing formal attire stepped up to explain.</p>, <p>\"....We've found him like this after the guests were all let out. We believe it to have happened in less than five minutes after we let them out. We were only able to find the corpse after one of our staff went in to clear the rooms.\"</p>, <p>He then went on to point toward the neck of the perpetrator.</p>, <p>\"If you look at his neck, we believe that he died from strangling.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Yet again, the Inquisitor remained silent. He inched closer to the naked corpse in front of him and placed his hand over its chest.</p>, <p>\"Inquisitor?\"</p>, <p>Just when the others were questioning his actions, he finally spoke.</p>, <p>\"He didn't die due to suffocation.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? But--\"</p>, <p>He tilted his head and frowned.</p>, <p>\"I sense traces of curse magic. Faint, but I can sense them.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>\"But even that isn't enough to kill him. They're too faint. A low Tier mage.\"</p>, <p>A picture of the scene replayed in the Inquisitor's mind. It was a scene he more or less was certain of.</p>, <p>He went on to open the eyes of the corpse before nodding.</p>, <p>\"This guy killed himself.\"</p>, <p>\"Killed himself?!\"</p>, <p>\"What? But...!\"</p>, <p>His conclusion drew the shock of all those present, but as the Inquisitor's eyes wandered to the forearm of the victim, his expression changed slightly.</p>, <p>\"Yes, he killed himself.\"</p>, <p>He was even more sure of it now.</p>, <p>The picture in his mind became clearer.</p>, <p>\"Curse magic was used to detain him. However, before he could get anything answered, this guy killed himself. The strangling is probably something that was done to make sure he was dead. Quite meticulous.\"</p>, <p>A subtle praise. But that was all. He shifted his eyes away from the corpse and turned around.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? Inquisitor?\"</p>, <p>\"My job is done here. I more or less understand what happened.\"</p>, <p>\"....But what about the thief?\"</p>, <p>\"Thief?\"</p>, <p> The Inquisitor blinked. Then, recalling the information he received from 'Central' he subtly smacked his forehead.</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>He pointed at the corpse.</p>, <p>\"It's probably him.\"</p>, <p>Before the people present in the room could even say anything back, he put his hat back on and pulled the door open.</p>, <p>\"If you would excuse me. I have a place to be.\"</p>, <p>A place he looked forward to visiting. An interesting place.</p>, <p>He stepped outside of the premises.</p>, <p>Just before leaving, he left a few last words.</p>, <p>\"Well... Probably?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was the next day and I came out of the bathroom holding onto a familiar-looking orb.</p>, <p>I set it down on the desk and sat on a chair where I took a book and opened it. For now, I decided to set aside the problem regarding the tattoo on my hand.</p>, <p>While there was indeed a chance that Delilah knew about my situation...</p>, <p>\"No, she probably knows.\"</p>, <p>It made no sense for someone as powerful as her not to know about such an organization. It was probably why she had mentioned my tattoo back then.</p>, <p>If I were to ask she'd probably be able to give me an answer, but...</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>I suddenly laughed.</p>, <p>Leaning back on my chair, a few things made sense to me.</p>, <p>\"....So that's why she made me her assistant.\"</p>, <p>It wasn't because I was weak or whatever excuse she had told me back then.</p>, <p>Far from it.</p>, <p>\"She wants to monitor me.\"</p>, <p>That much became clear to me after thinking about the situation. This tattoo I had... While there was a chance that I was wrong, I was inclined to believe that my deduction was correct.</p>, <p>Now that brought rise to several more questions.</p>, <p>How much did she know? What sort of organization was this? Did she think I was part of that organization? If so, is she my ally or enemy?</p>, <p>\"...How troublesome.\"</p>, <p>My head throbbed the more I thought about the matter.</p>, <p>The situation became even more complicated. Another reason why I decided to hold off on meeting her.</p>, <p>Until I knew what her stance was, I planned on taking my time to observe the situation.</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>I shifted my attention toward the book in my hand, [Bone Classification and their usage]. It was a book that was given to us as part of our course selection.</p>, <p>That turned out for the best since borrowing from the library would've been problematic.</p>, <p>Especially if someone came to investigate the Academy and found that right after coming back from the Auction the first thing I did was research bones.</p>, <p>Talk about suspicious.</p>, <p>Flip--</p>, <p>I flipped through the pages of the book and started to read. I knew the general information, but that wasn't enough. I needed to know more.</p>, <p>Which was what I did.</p>, <p>[Introduction: Dimensional bones and their usages]</p>, <p>There were three sections in the table of contents. Ranks and classifications, usage and integration, and types.</p>, <p>For the next hour or so I absorbed all the information in the book before finally summarizing all the information in my mind.</p>, <p>\"Hu.\"</p>, <p>I took a pen and jotted everything down.</p>, <p>: Ranks. Bones were ranked based on the rank of the originating monster. An infant rank monster produced an infant rank bone and so on. Primordial ranked monsters existed, but no such bone had ever been found. The greater the strength of the monster, the more powerful the ability.</p>, <p>: Types. The human body could only accept a maximum of five bones and once integrated couldn't be taken out. Any more and the body would break down. There were only seven types of bones that could be integrated into the human body: Skull Bone, Rib Bone, Ulna Bone, Femur Bone, Pelvis Bone, Vertebrae Bone, and lastly Mandible Bone.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>My pen stopped there and I shifted my attention toward the orb on my side.</p>, <p>Lastly, integration.</p>, <p>\"This way, right?\"</p>, <p>I pinched the orb in between my fingers and channeled my mana into it. The orb glowed a white hue as the room turned bright all of a sudden.</p>, <p>A magic circle floated in the air. It lasted several seconds before shattering.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>Thud!</p>, <p>A long black bone fell onto the table with a dull 'thud'.</p>, <p>\"....No wonder it looked so small.\"</p>, <p>In reality, it was merely a container for the actual bone which was about the size of my thigh.</p>, <p>I carefully observed the bone in front of me and stepped back. There was a certain aura that radiated from it that made me feel uncomfortable. It made my face winch. Not only that, but the smell it gave out was also anything but pleasing.</p>, <p>Still, after a careful look, I was able to understand what bone it was.</p>, <p>\"The right Ulna.\"</p>, <p>The bone right beneath the forearm.</p>, <p>\".....The rank also seems to be Junior Rank.\"</p>, <p>The bone belonged to a Metryl which was typically known to be a Junior-ranked monster. Even if it wasn't, the book stated that bones from Terror rank and up glowed and were extremely mana-dense.</p>, <p>This one wasn't so it was fair to assume it was a Junion Rank bone. Maybe Infant, but I doubted it was given the price.</p>, <p>\"For a Junior Rank bone to be this expensive...\"</p>, <p>Just how ludicrous were the prices for higher-ranked bones? The thought made me want to puke.</p>, <p>I really needed to find a way to make more money.</p>, <p>My progress would surely increase then.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath and reached out for the bone. The steps for integration were rather straightforward.</p>, <p>Place the bone on the respective area and create a mana flow between the two.</p>, <p>While I understood the principle behind the integration, I wasn't exactly confident I could pull it off.</p>, <p>I still tried nonetheless.</p>, <p>I followed the usual steps. Focusing my attention on my core, a certain warmth invaded my body.</p>, <p>I guided it toward the bone in my grasp.</p>, <p>\"Hm.\"</p>, <p>I felt my brows furrow.</p>, <p>There was a little resistance from the bone at first, but with the passing of seconds, it started to accept my mana.</p>, <p>The first step that I needed to do was 'Assimilation'. In short, I needed to get the bone used to my mana. This was a necessary step before the 'Integration' part.</p>, <p>So I decided to be patient. This wasn't going to be an easy step.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I was right.</p>, <p>The 'Assimilation' process was taking a little longer than I expected.</p>, <p>However, as I glanced at the clock, I smiled.</p>, <p>It was Sunday.</p>, <p>I had all the time in the world.</p>, <p>In total, it took about thirty more minutes for me to finally be able to smoothly channel my mana into the bone.</p>, <p>\"...Hah.\"</p>, <p>As soon as I reached that stage, I let out the breath I held in. It was now time for me to move toward the most important part.</p>, <p>\"Integration.\"</p>, <p>This process was also not very complicated. However, the book described this next stage as the hardest. Not because it was hard to do, but because of the pain one would experience during the integration.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that the Institute tested one's pain tolerance.</p>, <p>Unless one reached a score of three, they wouldn't allow any of the cadets to try to integrate with a bone without any assistance.</p>, <p>But to me...</p>, <p>That didn't matter. Three, four, five, six... So long as my body didn't fail me, it was nothing.</p>, <p>Pain... It was something I could deal with.</p>, <p>So.</p>, <p>I didn't hesitate with the next step.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>The bone stuck to my forearm and an excruciating pain invaded my body.</p>, <p>The pain was hard to describe.</p>, <p>It felt as if the bones on my forearm had gotten crushed by a large boulder as it fell. The muscles twisted and squirmed as a result, and the bone attached itself to my skin.</p>, <p>Creak...! Crack...!</p>, <p>The sounds that came out of my forearm were all for me to hear.</p>, <p>My lips trembled and my heart squirmed in pain.</p>, <p>The pain was something that I could vividly feel in my mind.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>Even while getting baptized by this intense pain, I didn't let out a single sound. I simply refused to yield to the pain.</p>, <p>Pain.</p>, <p>It meant a lot to me.</p>, <p>Having experienced it so much, I knew all sorts of pains. And... screaming from this type of pain felt pathetic.</p>, <p>'There's worse. This is nothing.'</p>, <p>So.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence and watched as my forearm squirmed and spasmed.</p>, <p>Creak...! Crack...!</p>, <p>The sounds continued but nothing came out of my mouth. I wouldn't let myself let anything out.</p>, <p>Such pain continued for the next hour.</p>, <p>The entire time I stood motionless and took in the pain.</p>, <p>Memorized it.</p>, <p>....So that the next time I experienced something similar, I could tell myself, 'I withstood this, why can't I withstand this?'</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>Snap--!</p>, <p>As I heard a loud snapping sound, a sense of weakness finally hit me.</p>, <p>I stumbled several steps back before falling onto my chair.</p>, <p>The world spun and the edges of my vision started to become dark. Gradually, the darkness spread, reaching down from all areas before finally taking away my sight.</p>, <p>Even in such a state, I remained silent.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I felt my right arm twitch and something came out.</p>, <p>I wasn't sure what.</p>, <p>I couldn't see.</p>, <p>It took several minutes for my vision to return.</p>, <p>When it did, I stared around me.</p>, <p>All I saw were...</p>, <p>\".....Threads.\"</p>]\n",

As though they were a part of my body, I knew exactly where each of them was.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>I hesitated to move from the spot.</p>, <p>While I could feel every single thread in the room, I had no idea how to control them.

My mana control was awful.</p>, <p>To prove this, I closed my eyes and channeled the mana in my body. Then, mimicking what I had done before, I felt my forearm tingle and a connection established.</p>, <p>A single white thread appeared in my darkened vision as I kept my eyes closed. Like a snake, I tried to direct it forward, but that proved to be a more difficult task than I expected as it continued to veer toward the left.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>Sweat trickled down the side of my face the more I focused on my task, and just as the thread inched forward a couple of meters, I had no choice but to cut my mana connection and open my eyes.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath.</p>, <p>Not only was it difficult to control, but it took a lot of mana too.</p>, <p>I reached my hand forward and touched the thread that coiled around my fingers.</p>, <p>\"Hisss...\"</p>, <p>I drew a cold breath when I felt a sharp pain on my finger as a red line crossed down my finger.</p>, <p>\"Sharp.\"</p>, <p>I suddenly grew excited.</p>, <p>This was what I had been missing the entire time...</p>, <p>A skill that could complement my curse magic which leaned more toward the support side like Emotive Magic.</p>, <p>Not only was this skill great for offense, but it was also extremely important for control.</p>, <p>If utilized properly, then I was sure my strength would increase drastically.

I heard about it.\"</p>, <p>\"....What's with the lukewarm reaction? Weren't you there yesterday? It was in the same place you guys were in.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, right.\"</p>, <p>He still didn't seem interested.</p>, <p>That was until Josephine took out a paper and placed it on the table.</p>, <p>\"Look, it's this guy.

Therefore, it didn't come as a shock to her.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>\"The apparent cause of death is a suicide, yet traces of curse magic have been detected on the body...\"</p>, <p>Her mind had been continuously haunted by one thought.</p>, <p>'.....He did it.'</p>, <p>Julien was the culprit.</p>, <p>She was sure of it.</p>, <p>It was a wild conclusion that ate at her mind, but thinking about it, the butler was most likely the person who had planted the 'item' in her purse.</p>, <p>He was the one who wanted to screw her over.</p>, <p>Even now, she didn't understand why she had been targeted. Was it because they had a grudge against her family?</p>, <p>\"Evelyn.\"</p>, <p>That could be a reason.

We're here to study.\"</p>, <p>Only then did she seem to recall the purpose behind their group and sighed.</p>, <p>\"Fine~\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Evelyn stared at her for a brief moment before pursing her lips and paying attention to the question in front of her.</p>, <p>Though 'he' continued to haunt her mind, she had no choice but to pretend to be fine. At least, she had to pretend to be fine in front of everyone.</p>, <p>She thought she was doing a good job at it, but...</p>, <p>What she didn't notice was the sudden squint of Aoife's eyes as she looked at her.</p>, <p>Her yellow pupils flickered as she similarly lowered her head to focus on her paper.</p>, <p>Scribble~</p>, <p>In the newfound silence, the collective sound of their pens scratching their papers echoed throughout.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A week later.</p>, <p>It was now the Monday of the next week. The week passed without any hiccups. Attending lectures, training, and even more training.</p>, <p>Such had been my life for the past week.</p>, <p>I was content with such a life. Sort of. My progress had started to stagnate, and I was once again reminded of my lack of talent in the magic field.</p>, <p>\"This will be the second time that you will all explore the Mirror Dimension. For the past two weeks, we've been preparing you for your current trip. Unlike last time, we will allow you freedom of travel.\"</p>, <p>We stood by a familiar crack.</p>, <p>There was a certain tension that hung in the air as all the cadets waited patiently for the Professor to speak.</p>, <p>I could feel the nervousness of some of the cadets beside me as they chewed on their nails.</p>, <p>I couldn't blame them.</p>, <p>We were currently headed into the deeper territory of the Mirror Dimension.</p>, <p>Contrary to them, rather than being nervous, I was somewhat excited. I wanted to see the result of my training.</p>, <p>To what extent had I improved over the past week?</p>, <p>\"Of course, when I say freedom of travel, there will still be a limit to how far you can go. The Black Region is your limit. Going further into other regions is prohibited.

Monsters don't have emotions and without emotions...\"</p>, <p>Wesley ended his sentence there but the meaning behind his words was clear for everyone to understand.</p>, <p>Leon looked back to see the reaction of the other group members. Besides Aoife who seemed unsure, and Evelyn who seemed confused, they all shared the same opinion as Wesley.</p>, <p>Leon sighed.</p>, <p>Not because he didn't understand where they were coming from, but because his 'instincts' told him otherwise.</p>, <p>That...</p>, <p>If he didn't bring him, he'd regret it.</p>, <p>But how could he explain this to them? In the end, frowning, Leon looked at Wesley and answered.</p>, <p>\"....Whether he'll be of use or not, we'll see later. For now, we will wait.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>\"Ah... Tsk.\"</p>, <p>I stood up and clicked my tongue.</p>, <p>\"...Another fail.\"</p>, <p>Extending my hand, I withdrew the thread that extended from out of my forearm. I then sat in silence and stared at the distant creature running away from the area.</p>, <p>It had been two hours since I had left the supply station at the Academy gate's entrance.</p>, <p>\"I don't have much time.\"</p>, <p>My appointment with Leon was set for exactly three days, Zone [F].</p>, <p>With our expedition lasting for about a week, three days was plenty of time for me to train and improve.</p>, <p>The Black Region was split into 7 different zones which went from [A] to [G]. Each Zone contained a different environment and habitat.</p>, <p>I was currently in Zone [A].</p>, <p>The safest of all the seven zones.</p>, <p>Such was my current limit. Besides my new ability and curse magic, I was practically defenseless against the monsters.</p>, <p>I had no choice but to go to the safest zone.</p>, <p>\"Thankfully, I'm not as helpless now...\"</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>A thread coiled down from my forearm, slowly crawling toward the cracks of the rocky surface beneath. I used my mind to carefully guide the thread around the cracks and towards the distance where a furry creature stood.</p>, <p>'Aurorahemoth'</p>, <p>Such was the name of the creature I was currently hunting.</p>, <p>Despite its name, it was one of the weakest creatures found within the Mirror Dimension. With its tiny body and short limbs, it was essentially a standing target. It bore a resemblance to a rabbit but it was a lot more grotesque in appearance.</p>, <p>With its mouth split into four sections, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth that twisted within its gaping maw, it was anything but cute.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>\".....I missed.\"</p>, <p>Regardless of how much I tried, just when the thread would reach a certain distance, it would detect it and hop away.</p>, <p>\"How troublesome.\"</p>, <p>I wasn't disheartened by the failure.</p>, <p>Though I kept on failing, I was getting closer and closer to the creature with each attempt. That wasn't all. I could feel my control over the thread to be smoother with each attempt.</p>, <p>This was a great experience, but...</p>, <p>\"Still too slow.\"</p>, <p>The rate of progress was nice, but I was still not satisfied.</p>, <p>I sat down on a nearby rock and stared into the sky. It was gray, and a white sun hung in the distance. The air was dry, and there was hardly any vegetation around me.</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and let my mana course through my body before agglomerating towards the tip of my fingers.</p>, <p>Rune One--Rune Two--Rune Three--Rune Four--Rune Five--Rune Six--Rune Seven--Rune Eight--Rune Nine--Rune Ten--Rune Eleven....</p>, <p>Tzzz--</p>, <p>A familiar sound.</p>, <p>Opening my eyes, I pursed my lips.</p>, <p>\".....That failed too.\"</p>, <p>Nothing seemed to be going right for me. [Chains of Alakantria]. I was still struggling to unlock this spell.</p>, <p>It was frustrating, but I had become numb to the sense of frustration.</p>, <p>All I felt was frustration.</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>As a hollow laugh escaped from my lips, I directed my attention toward the distance where another creature greeted my sight.</p>, <p>I looked toward my arm and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>Immediately, a thread coiled out of my forearm, coiling around my hand and splitting into five different threads.</p>, <p>Drip...</p>, <p>Sweat trickled down the side of my face the moment I split the threads.</p>, <p>Accompanying the pain was a sharp pain. Having to split my attention five different ways was quite exhausting.</p>, <p>Ignoring my eyelid which was twitching, I guided the five threads towards the creature in the distance.</p>, <p>The distance between the creature and the creature shrank.</p>, <p>Ten meters...</p>, <p>Nine meters...</p>, <p>Eight meters....</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>Sweat continued to pour down from my face as my right eyelid twitched. The pain in my head intensified, and my jaw clicked.</p>, <p>Even so, I persisted and separated the threads.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I forced myself to suffer in silence as the threads split.</p>, <p>Biting my lips, I imprinted the sight ahead in my mind. Then, closing my eyes and letting darkness embrace my vision, I envisioned a path for the threads which were the only things that appeared in my darkened vision.</p>, <p>Like snakes, they coiled around the ground and neared the creature.</p>, <p>Seven meters...</p>, <p>Six meters...</p>, <p>Five meters...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I stopped right there and opened my eyes.</p>, <p>The creature's ears perked up as its head raised to look around. Clearly, it had detected something but couldn't understand what.</p>, <p>\"Five meters...\"</p>, <p>That was my current limit.</p>, <p>My finger twitched. One of the threads lunged forward. As if expecting such action, the creature jumped ahead.</p>, <p>Swoosh--</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Hiek!\"</p>, <p>It was surrounded.</p>, <p>\"Kh.\"</p>, <p>My hand clenched tightly, urging the threads into action as they surged towards the creature.</p>, <p>This time, there was no avenue of escape. With every path blocked and suspended mid-air, the creature could only observe helplessly as the threads ensnared its body, coiling around its limbs.</p>, <p>\"....Hah.\"</p>, <p>I watched from the distance as the pain in my mind intensified. However, I ignored the pain and smiled.</p>, <p>\"I did it.\"</p>, <p>A wave of relief washed over me as my chest trembled.</p>, <p>\"Hieek--!\"</p>, <p>The creature continued to trash in the distance as the threads coiled around it. I was just about to put it out of its misery when I frowned.</p>, <p>\"Hm.\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, I felt multiple pairs of eyes falling on me.</p>, <p>When I turned around, I felt my body freeze. Tens of different pairs of eyes were staring at me. Their expressions were anything but friendly.</p>, <p>I didn't let myself fall into panic and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>The Professor had warned beforehand that there was a likelihood of such a scenario occurring. It was for this reason that I wasn't panicked.</p>, <p>Furthermore, Aurorahemoth's weren't known for their speed.</p>, <p>'I'll probably be able to run away if I want to.'</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth.</p>, <p>For what reason did I need to run away? If I couldn't even handle such weak creatures then how was I supposed to get stronger?</p>, <p>I smacked the side of my head and took another deep breath.</p>, <p>\"Right, whatever...\"</p>, <p>\"Hieek--!\"</p>, <p>Clenching my hand, the creature in the distance split into ten different pieces.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>The sudden notification that flashed before my very eyes took me by surprise. However, taking note of the advancing creatures, I put it to the side and recalled the threads back to me.</p>, <p>This was probably going to hurt, but...</p>, <p>\"Come.\"</p>]\n",

I silently gulped.</p>, <p>.....Would I even be able to keep my head if they managed to land a hit?</p>, <p>Probably. But it would certainly deal a lot of pain. And while I could withstand pain, I didn't like pain.</p>, <p>If possible, I wanted to avoid it.</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>I continued to avoid the incoming attacks while focusing on the threads coming out of my arm. There were a total of three at the moment. I thought about making more, but my mind couldn't keep up.</p>, <p>There were too many things that I needed to focus on.</p>, <p>My environment, the incoming Aurorahemoth's, and my mana reserves. My mind couldn't keep up.</p>, <p>Three threads were my limit.</p>, <p>I continued like this until I couldn't.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Gradually, my steps halted and I looked around me.</p>, <p>\"Hieeek—! Hieeek—!\"</p>, <p>I was surrounded from all sides. Stepping above the scattered rocks around me, their glowing eyes fiercely stared at me.</p>, <p>My heart sped at the sight of them and I had a hard time keeping myself from panicking.</p>, <p>....But I had to stay calm.</p>, <p>That much was necessary.</p>, <p>\"One... Two... Three... Fifteen...\"</p>, <p>Fifteen creatures surrounded me. The reality of the situation seemed even more grim than I had anticipated.</p>, <p>For some reason, the creatures just stood and observed me. As if they were waiting for something.</p>, <p>.....I didn't know exactly what, but I didn't let that affect my mind and introduced two more threads.</p>, <p>Now that I didn't need to move, I could split my attention toward creating two more.</p>, <p>Quietly, they coiled around my fingers before descending towards the ground, permeating through the cracked earth and positioning themselves along the perimeter where the rocks were.</p>, <p>It all happened quickly, about a second and a half...</p>, <p>The threads had just started moving when I noticed a change.</p>, <p>I hastily looked up only to feel my heart drop.</p>, <p>\"Oh...\"</p>, <p>All fifteen Aurorahemoths had their mouths open, their large teeth exposed for me to see.</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>I stopped and reflexively took a defensive stance.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>That proved to be futile on my end. With their mouths open, the Aurorahemoths's bellies inflated.</p>, <p>I realized then what was happening then.</p>, <p> But it was already too late.</p>, <p>\"Hieeeeeeeeek—!\"</p>, <p>Their collective screech pierced through the surroundings, heading directly toward me as I stood helplessly in the middle of their screech.</p>, <p>\"....Ukh!\"</p>, <p>It came fast.</p>, <p>Before I knew it, I was hit. I couldn't describe the pain. It felt numbing and it came as fast as it left.</p>, <p>....But it took my hearing alongside it.</p>, <p>Tzzzzzzzz—</p>, <p>A constant buzz echoed within my mind as my balance shifted and I struggled to keep a footing on the ground.</p>, <p>It was at that moment that I saw all the creatures make a move.</p>, <p>As if their minds were connected, they all lunged at me from all sorts of angles. I tried to avoid them, but there were simply way too many of them.</p>, <p>\"Kh...!\"</p>, <p>A sudden, sharp pain jolted through my right leg. As I glanced downwards, a deep wound met my sight.</p>, <p>Ah...</p>, <p>It took just a second for another one to appear. This time on my shoulder, and I stumbled forward.</p>, <p>\"....Ukh.\"</p>, <p>Then another...</p>, <p>\"Urgh...!\"</p>, <p>And another...</p>, <p>\"Akh!\"</p>, <p>And another...</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Wounds started to pile up on my body. My blood seeped onto the ground staining it red. I had long stopped screaming as the pain continued to accumulate.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>I fell on my knees as I hunched down.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I felt my jaw tremble from the pain. It wanted to open it. To scream at the pain that was currently invading every part of my body.</p>, <p>But I didn't let it.</p>, <p>This much pain wasn't worth screaming over.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I looked up.</p>, <p>What met my sight was a set of razor-sharp teeth. It was headed straight for my face. That was when I knew I had to make a move.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Amidst the silence that took over my mind, I slowly clenched my hand.</p>, <p>The threads that I had carefully laid all over the ground sprung up as they grew taut.

That was what I told myself.</p>, <p>The truth was probably different, but it was something that I had to do. It was the only way I could've envisioned myself winning.</p>, <p>While I could've used [Hands of Malady], it wasn't a great skill when facing against fifteen different opponents.</p>, <p>By the time I incapacitated two to three Aurorahemoths, I'd already be out of mana.</p>, <p>Such was why I had no choice but to use my body as bait.</p>, <p>It hurt...</p>, <p>\"But it worked.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I reached out for my bag and took out several ointments which I placed over my wounds.</p>, <p>Thankfully, they were merely superficial wounds.</p>, <p>A little deep, but still manageable.</p>, <p>\"....They should heal in a couple of hours.\"</p>, <p>Such was the magic of the ointments of this world.</p>, <p>While I waited for my wounds to heal, I reflected on the fight I just had.</p>, <p>It was pathetic.</p>, <p>I was pathetic.</p>, <p>This wasn't the way that I wanted to win. I understood that I was still learning and that this was merely just the start, but...</p>, <p>It didn't stop me from feeling frustrated with myself.</p>, <p>Simply put my control was still not there yet. Because of that, I needed to make sure my attacks landed in one hit.</p>, <p>I couldn't afford to just graze them.</p>, <p>That woul-</p>, <p>\"Uh.\"</p>, <p>I paused and blinked.</p>, <p>A thought suddenly struck me.</p>, <p>What if...?</p>, <p>\"...What if I combine Etherweave with my spells? Emotive? Hands of Malady?\"</p>, <p>The moment the thought entered my mind it didn't leave it.</p>, <p>It just remained there and continued to repeat itself.</p>, <p>Over and over again.</p>, <p>At that, I had no choice but to give in to my desires. I brought my hand forward where a thread slowly moved out from my forearm, coiling around my middle finger.</p>, <p>A purple magic circle soon manifested over my hand.</p>, <p>It hovered around it before shrinking down. Typically, it would trace a downward path, enveloping my entire hand and casting it in a purple hue. This time, however, I changed things up.</p>, <p>I focused my intent away from my hand and toward the thread.</p>, <p>The circle shrinked and moved down my finger.</p>, <p>Sweat started to accumulate down the side of my face as I focused my attention on the circle hovering over my finger.</p>, <p>It gradually inched closer down, reaching the tip of my finger.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>My heart sped at the sight before me.</p>, <p>It was hard to see given how thin the thread was, but it was gradually turning purple.</p>, <p>My eyes widened at the sight.</p>, <p>\"Can it really...\"</p>, <p>I felt my heart beat faster than before. I felt a strange sense of excitement and nervously swallowed my saliva.</p>, <p>The circle inched further down.</p>, <p>It was now halfway down my finger. The thread turned purple for each part the circle passed.</p>, <p>Even more sweat trickled down the side of my face as I maximized my focus.</p>, <p>I was close...</p>, <p>So very close.</p>, <p>....And just as the circle continued to move down, I suddenly frowned.</p>, <p>The magic circle stopped.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>I voluntarily shattered the circle.</p>, <p>That was because I realized I was doing things wrong.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stood there in silence to collect my breath and mana again. Then, I extended my hand forward and a magic circle again formed. Just like last time, it shrunk and hovered over my middle finger.</p>, <p>This time, I didn't let it move down.</p>, <p>Rather...</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>I guided the thread out and into the magic circle.</p>, <p>\".....As expected.\"</p>, <p>The thread changed color and my mana expenditure significantly reduced. Not only that, but so did my amount of concentration.</p>, <p>I stared at the purple thread before me.</p>, <p>Now this...</p>, <p>It was certainly something.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The Mirror Dimension was vast. It covered a massive expanse of land, its size rivaling, if not surpassing, those of the entire Empire, which itself occupied a substantial portion of the world.</p>, <p>The Black Region was regarded as the smallest among all the regions. Considering the difficulty in conquering even a small portion of this dimension, its status as the smallest seemed only fitting.</p>, <p>Typically, when entering the Black Region, most cadets jumped at the opportunity to go toward the more dangerous regions.</p>, <p>Such was the best place to train.</p>, <p>However, there were a few who preferred to start in the lowest zone to get accustomed to the environment and monsters.</p>, <p>Swooosh—!</p>, <p>\"Ah, fucking hell....\"</p>, <p>Kiera was one such cadet.</p>, <p>Staring at the numerous burning corpses in front of her, she pressed her finger against her ear. It was still ringing.</p>, <p>\"....Fuck, I can't hear shit.\"</p>, <p>No, she could, but it was just a constant ring.</p>, <p>The more it continued, the more she got annoyed. Especially when she noticed two more headed her way.</p>, <p>\"Tsk… How much do these fuckers reproduce? They're endless.\"</p>, <p>A red magic circle hovered over her hand as the two creatures caught fire in the distance. They shrieked in pain, but Kiera had none of that.</p>, <p>\"…Agh, fuck. Is that how it is? Are you all so good at screaming because you mate so much?\"</p>, <p>Just when she thought she was done, another one appeared.</p>, <p>Her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"My word. They really can't stop fucking…\"</p>, <p>In the end, after dispatching the creature, she decided to leave. The creatures, while easy, were hard to handle when in groups of more than five. She doubted anyone would have a hard time handling them en masse.</p>, <p>Packing up her staff, she slung her bag over her shoulder and headed out toward the next region.</p>, <p>The route wasn't far. It was about an hour's walk according to the map.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She was halfway there when she suddenly paused.</p>, <p>From the peripheral of her eyes, she caught something in the distance.</p>, <p>Something felt off.</p>, <p>No, it was off.</p>, <p>Her head turned to face the distance and her expression finally changed.</p>, <p>\"What is...\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened considerably and her bag fell on the floor.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>Off into the distance, she could see the mutilated bodies of over several dozen Aurorahemoth's. The same creatures she struggled to deal with just moments prior.</p>, <p>\"What sort of...\"</p>, <p>She jogged over to carefully analyze the situation. Her surprise increased as she noticed how cleanly they had been killed.</p>, <p>A sword...? An arrow?</p>, <p>For the cuts to be so clean...</p>, <p>\"Leon?\"</p>, <p>A name popped up in her mind.</p>, <p>He appeared to be the only person capable of such a feat.</p>, <p>Kiera meticulously examined the corpses in front of her. Just as she was looking around, her eyes froze on a specific area.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>A shoulder pad.</p>, <p>It looked to have fallen off during the exchange and most likely belonged to the one responsible for all of this.</p>, <p>Staring at it for a good minute, she quietly pocketed the pad.</p>, <p>Her curiosity suddenly peaked.</p>, <p>\"....Who did this?\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Three days passed in a blur.</p>, <p>It was the day of the appointment and Leon and the other members were already waiting in Zone [F].</p>, <p>\"So this is the [F] zone?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn looked around with wide eyes. In their view lay a luminescent forest, emitting a deep blue glow that starkly contrasted with the dull grayness of the surrounding world. In a sense, it added to the ominousness of the area.</p>, <p>Bordering next to the Yellow Region, it was the most dangerous Zone within the Black Region.</p>, <p>Leon looked around before turning back to look at the others.</p>, <p>\"Be careful. Do not stray too far. I can sense multiple strong presences deep within.\"</p>, <p>\"Your senses are that sharp?\"</p>, <p>Aoife asked while she leaned on a nearby tree. She closed her eyes and tried to sense her surroundings, but after a while frowned and shook her head.</p>, <p>\".....I can't sense anything.\"</p>, <p>\"I'm a knight. That's why.\"</p>, <p>\"I am too.\"</p>, <p>Aoife didn't seem to be satisfied with the answer but left it there.</p>, <p>There was a fundamental difference between those that belonged to the [Body] category and those that belonged to the [Mind] and [Elemental] category.</p>, <p>To be classified as a knight, one had to belong to the [Body] category which focused on enhancing the human body.</p>, <p>Aoife was proficient in both [Mind] and [Body]. However, unlike him, she focused most of her attention on [Telekinesis] which belonged to the [Mind] category.</p>, <p>It was understandable that his senses were sharper than hers.</p>, <p>After all, his only talents lay in the [Body] category.</p>, <p>\"Isn't he late? How much longer are we supposed to wait for him?\"</p>, <p>A voice suddenly broke Leon out of his thoughts. When he looked back, Wesley, who was similarly leaning against a nearby tree, frowned.</p>, <p>\"It's been an hour since we arrived here and he's still not here. Are we sure he's coming?\"</p>, <p>Leon frowned but still answered.</p>, <p>\".....He should be coming.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, well, if you say so.\"</p>, <p>Leon thought he'd leave it at that, but he suddenly continued.</p>, <p>\"You don't think anything happened to him on the way?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"I mean, he did go by himself. And like I said, he's not very strong. It wouldn't be out of the question.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"What if he got hurt and can't make it? How much longer should we wait for?\"</p>, <p>'He talks too much.'</p>, <p>It was starting to become more and more apparent to Leon. This hadn't been the first remark he had made toward Julien.</p>, <p>For the past three days, he had been throwing random jabs at him.</p>, <p>Nobody said a thing considering that they were a group and none of the group members had anything to say about him.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p> It was starting to grow on Leon's nerves.</p>, <p>\"You, c—\"</p>, <p>Rustle—</p>, <p>A gentle rustle halted Leon mid-sentence as he turned his head in the direction of where the sound came from.</p>, <p>Then, a figure slowly emerged from the other side of the trees.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>The moment he appeared, the expressions of all those present changed. This was especially so for Wesley who couldn't help but cover his mouth.</p>, <p>\"Pftt. \"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A weird mixture of expressions greeted my sight the moment I managed to clear the forest and arrive at the meeting area.</p>, <p>I couldn't blame them.</p>, <p>While I wasn't injured, my clothes were a mess with tears all over the place. Dry blood stained my attire, adding to the disarray.</p>, <p>I had been so immersed in my training that I had almost forgotten about the meeting.</p>, <p>Thankfully, I managed to make it in time.</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>A certain sound caught my attention and when I looked up, I found someone staring at with me a look of mockery.</p>, <p>'Who is this guy?'</p>, <p>With long black hair, hazel eyes, and handsome features, he appeared somewhat familiar, but I couldn't quite put it where.</p>, <p>\"You're here.\"</p>, <p>My attention shifted away when I noticed Leon approach me.</p>, <p>He sported a small frown on his face but didn't say anything about my clothing and started to brief me on the situation.</p>, <p>\"Near here there's a Nyxfernal nest.\"</p>, <p>I raised my brow.</p>, <p>'Nyxfernal nest?'</p>, <p>Having studied the books before coming here, I was well learned on Nyxfernals. They were an underground creature that loved to dig tunnels. Highly toxic, and nimble with sharp claws, they were monsters that the Academy recommended avoiding.</p>, <p>....So why was he telling me this?</p>, <p>\"I've already scouted the area beforehand, and there's only one Junior ranked one. The rest are infant ranked.\"</p>, <p>\"And?\"</p>, <p>\"Within the nest, there is a handful of Lumicore Fungi.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>\"It may not be useful for you, but it can fetch a high price if you were to sell it on the market. If you help us, we will give you a share of the gains.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer immediately. Staring into Leon's eyes for a brief moment, I proceeded to lower my head.</p>, <p>Lumicore Fungi. I knew about them. They weren't exactly useful for me. They were resources more fit for those who practiced the [Body] category.</p>, <p>However, that didn't mean they were worthless.</p>, <p>No, rather, they were worth a lot of money. I wasn't sure exactly how much, but each gram was worth at least multiple dozen Rend.</p>, <p>I was in desperate need of money.</p>, <p>To become stronger faster, I needed more resources. Money was the key to gaining access to such resources.</p>, <p>I had no other choice but to accept.</p>, <p>And when my thoughts paused there, I looked up to Leon and nodded.</p>, <p>\"Alright. I'll accept.\"</p>, <p>Just briefly, I noticed Leon's lips pull up slightly. But it left as fast as it came, and I had a hard time figuring out whether I had seen it wrongly or not.</p>, <p>In the end, I let it be.</p>, <p>\"....Get ready. We will be leaving soon.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>Located deep into the [F] Zone was a certain web of tunnels that one could enter from a few spots above.</p>, <p>Somewhat familiar with the area, Leon guided us toward a dark cave that one couldn't see the end of.</p>, <p>\"Is this the place?\"</p>, <p>Luxon glanced around with a frown.</p>, <p>\"Do we have some light? Or do you-\"</p>, <p>\"There's no need.\"</p>, <p>Leon casually looked back before stepping in.</p>, <p>\"You'll see once we reach deeper inside.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...\"</p>, <p>His figure disappeared into the cave. Aoife followed right after him. Though confused, Luxon sighed and followed right after. I was just about to follow when someone turned to face me.</p>, <p>He appeared friendly.</p>, <p>\"Make sure you stay behind me.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>\"I have no idea why Leon wanted you to come, but...\"</p>, <p>He lowered his head to scan my body.</p>, <p>\"....I can protect you if you stay behind me. Since you seem to be struggling so much, I thought it'd be best if you stayed with me. I'm a sharpshooter so I've got great eyesight.\"</p>, <p>What is this guy...</p>, <p>\"If you stay next to me you won't get in the way of others and might even be able to contribute.\"</p>, <p>Every word that he spat was spat with a friendly smile, and yet... All I felt was a strange sense of disgust.</p>, <p>I was just about to respond to him when he turned around and entered the cave.</p>, <p>\"Just make sure you listen to me. It'll do all of us good.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence for a short moment before lowering my head to stare at my hand.</p>, <p>Struggling?....Might be able to contribute?</p>, <p>This...</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>I almost laughed.</p>, <p>What sort of situation was this? I wasn't even mad. I was just baffled. He couldn't even hide his own dislike towards me.</p>, <p>I shook my head.</p>, <p>I had thought people would finally leave me alone after what I had done, but there were still a few who were not convinced.</p>, <p>Most likely, he had some basis behind his confidence. Given that I could somewhat recognize him, he must've had some strength to back up his confidence.</p>, <p>Still...</p>, <p>\"What a pain.\"</p>, <p>Just when was it going to be enough?</p>, <p>Scratching the side of my head, I entered the cave and embraced the darkness. I had just taken several steps when I stopped.</p>, <p>The air was thick with the scent of earth and dampness, and the sound of dripping water echoed softly in the distance.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>However, off in the distance I took notice of a strange glow.</p>, <p>I didn't hesitate to follow the light and soon enough I was left shocked by the sight that greeted me. Covering the walls and ceiling of the cave was an unusual blue moss, emitting a soft glow that illuminated the entire cavern.</p>, <p>'Wow.'</p>, <p>It looked like a scene straight out of a movie and I had to take a moment to observe the area.</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>I only looked away when I felt someone call my name. Looking up, I saw everyone looking at me. I briefly paused my gaze on the black-haired kid before turning it back to Leon who pressed his hand against his mouth and nudged me forward.</p>, <p>\"We're near the nest so be careful. If you—\"</p>, <p>BOOOM—!</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>The cavern shook all of a sudden. Unable to keep it steady, I lost my footing and fell against the ground.</p>, <p>I was the only one that fell as almost everyone was able to keep their footing.</p>, <p>\"Hiek!\"</p>, <p>Someone else did fall on me as my vision was covered by a set of purple hair.</p>, <p>The moment she fell on me, I felt her body turn rigid and our eyes met. I hardly reacted given that I knew that this was an accident, but she didn't think so as her eyes darted all over the place but me.</p>, <p>Then, just as she was about to say something, I caught sight of a massive figure headed in our direction from the distance and I pushed her off of me.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>A tremendous pressure that made it hard to breathe emitted from the creature's body as I tried to get my bearings.</p>, <p>Just as I was about to move forward, a hand pushed me back.</p>, <p>\"Don't interfere.\"</p>, <p>\"Get ready!\"</p>, <p>Leon's voice reached me shortly after. With his glowing sword, he pushed his feet forward and dashed forward.</p>, <p>His figure blurred forward as it headed toward the distant creature. Following him right behind was Aoife who was just a tad bit slower.</p>, <p>The others also got into position as they readied themselves to face the creature.</p>, <p>I was the only one who did nothing as I met a pair of hazel eyes.</p>, <p>\"We discussed it before, right? Stay with me so that we don't interfere with them.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Just then, I deeply stared into his eyes. He met them back. As if he was trying to challenge me. However... that didn't last for long.</p>, <p>He soon started to grow uncomfortable with my gaze. So much that his eyes started to dart away from me.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I kept at it until he couldn't bear it anymore and finally looked away.</p>, <p>I knew then the reasoning behind his attitude.</p>, <p>.....He was afraid of me.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>....He was afraid of me?</p>, <p>Was that the case....? I thought so at first, but surely that couldn't be the only reason for his hatred and dislike towards me.</p>, <p>There had to be something else.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Thinking things through I realized that I hadn't exactly been the friendliest of people.</p>, <p>I tended to mind my own business and avoided interacting with others. It was mainly so that my cover wouldn't be blown but at the same time because I didn't want to get attached to anyone.</p>, <p>But still...</p>, <p>For him to be afraid of me. There had to be a more concrete reason.</p>, <p>BOOOM—!</p>, <p>The cave shook as Leon's sword came into contact with Nyxfernal—a large creature with a stout body and thick, fur-covered form. Its sharp claws gleamed under the light from the moss as its small, beady eyes fiercely glared at us.</p>, <p>\"Kh....!\"</p>, <p>Upon coming into contact with the Nyxfernal, Leon's sword ricocheted back. Just as he was about to lose balance, Aoife raised her hand and his body halted mid-air.</p>, <p>\"....Thanks.\"</p>, <p>She followed up with another wave, stopping the beast's claws from slashing at him.</p>, <p>Kacha!</p>, <p>Lighting burst from out of nowhere, landing on the Nyxfernal thick fur. Evelyn, who stood by the side, held both hands forward as her uniform and hair fluttered.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>That too seemed like a futile attempt as Evelyn let out a small curse.</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>\"Let me.\"</p>, <p>A figure rushed the creature. His speed was fast, and within moments, he appeared right beneath the creature's body. Two magic circles formed around his fists as he punched out with everything he had.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>Even that seemed like a meaningless attempt as his fists stopped right after making contact with the creature's underbelly.</p>, <p>Luxon immediately panicked as he looked behind.</p>, <p>\"Shit, Aoife! Save me....!\"</p>, <p>Just as he said those words, the Nyxfernal's body flexed and its tail swung right at Luxon who crossed his arms to brace for impact.</p>, <p>Thankfully, Aoife was quick enough to react as she pulled him back just in time to avoid the attack.</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>The cave shook even more fiercely as Luxon skidded several meters back.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaaa... Thanks.\"</p>, <p>\"Try again.\"</p>, <p>With cold focus, Aoife lifted her palm and continued to support from behind. She wasn't the only one supporting.</p>, <p>Xiu!</p>, <p>An arrow flew at fast speeds, hitting the tough fur of the Nyxfernal. Sparks flew, but nothing came out of it.</p>, <p> Aoife frowned and turned her head slightly.</p>, <p>\"....Aim for its eyes.\"</p>, <p>\"Got it.\"</p>, <p>He pulled the string of the bow back and prepared to attack again.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stood quietly beside him. Until this moment, I remained standing without doing a single thing. I had no business interfering.</p>, <p>I knew the extent of my skills. There wasn't much I could do. At least, not yet.</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and extended the threads towards the ground, splitting them in three. I looked around to locate the best area to set them up.</p>, <p>BOOOM—!</p>, <p>I ignored the chaos around me and guided the threads carefully around the walls of the cave.</p>, <p>My head twitched as I felt a sharp pain. However, I ignored the pain and continued to guide the threads around the walls of the cave.</p>, <p>I was waiting for the right time to act.</p>, <p>For...</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>I felt a sudden vibration and opened my eyes.</p>, <p>\"What...\"</p>, <p>There was something odd about the vibration. It wasn't coming from the Nyxfernal in the distance. It was coming from somewhere else...</p>, <p>\"Beneath...?\"</p>, <p>I looked down.</p>, <p>It was then that it happened.</p>, <p>!</p>, <p>Something exploded from beneath me and the ground split. The area it covered was small, and it was right beneath where I stood.</p>, <p>The footing I held disappeared, and my body jolted with a weird sensation as gravity started to pull me down from beneath.</p>, <p>In that split second, I felt the world around me slow down.</p>, <p>I managed to catch a glimpse of everything around me. From the changing expressions of Leon, Evelyn, Aoife, Luxon... to the look of panic on Wesley's face as he fell alongside me.</p>, <p>.....I caught all of it in my mind before everything turned dark.</p>, <p>The last thing I remembered was recalling the threads and creating new ones.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Julien...\"</p>, <p>It all happened so fast that nobody was able to react on time.</p>, <p>BOOOM!</p>, <p>All Leon felt was a subtle trembling of the ground behind. When he turned his head, he caught a glimpse of Julien.</p>, <p>....As usual, he seemed unperturbed. Even as the ground beneath him quaked, he stood with a frown. As if this had nothing to do with him.</p>, <p>Or maybe things had happened too fast for him to react.</p>, <p>Even so...</p>, <p>His figure, alongside Wesley's disappeared from their sight.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>He could hardly make a sound before his ear detected an odd whistling noise heading right in his direction.</p>, <p>Instinctively, he moved back and just barely managed to avoid the tail of the Nyxfernal.</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>\"Get a grip.\"</p>, <p>A cold voice echoed beside him. When he looked, he saw Aoife staring at the monster with a tight frown.</p>, <p>\"I know you're his knight, but you need to focus on the monster in front of us. We can look for them later. They should be f—uh!\"</p>, <p>Her words halted and she raised both her hands.</p>, <p>Leon looked at the creature which stopped mid-motion before nodding his head. She was right.</p>, <p>There was no point in thinking about Julien. He was going to be fine.</p>, <p>There was no way his instincts would lie to him.</p>, <p>He...</p>, <p>Was definitely fine.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>I opened my eyes. Darkness embraced my vision as my head throbbed. I hung suspended in the air as the threads kept me in place.</p>, <p>\"Where am I....?\"</p>, <p>I looked up.</p>, <p>There was hardly any light.</p>, <p>It seemed like I had fallen into a deep hole.</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and felt the threads. There were a total of two left. The other one had snapped. I focused on creating another one and safely planted it into a crack on the wall.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>I tried pulling myself up, but that seemed to be impossible given my current abilities.</p>, <p>The threads were still fragile. It was already a miracle that I was safe.</p>, <p>\"....Looks like I have no choice but to go down.\"</p>, <p>It was the only thing I could do.</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>In the darkness, I slowly and carefully extended the threads, guiding my body toward the bottom of the hole.</p>, <p>I thought back on the situation and frowned.</p>, <p>There was someone who had fallen with me. What had happened to him? Had he died...? Or was he still alive? I pursed my lips and continued to guide myself down until I eventually felt my feet touch a surface.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>The air felt damp and a still silence filled my surroundings. A strange tension lingered over my surroundings as I felt my muscles tense and my skin grow cold.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I took a quiet breath and took out my bag where I reached for my torch.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>A pair of eyes immediately greeted my sight the moment I lit up the torch and my heart almost stopped. Thankfully, I was able to keep myself composed.</p>, <p>....I was somewhat used to fear.</p>, <p>\"Took you long enough.\"</p>, <p>A familiar voice reached my ears, and when I got a better look, I stood frozen by the sight that bore before me. The only thing I could recognize were his hazel eyes. Everything else was different.</p>, <p>The contours of the face were distorted, with areas of puckered flesh. The color was uneven, ranging from red to mottled shades of brown and gray.</p>, <p>What had...</p>, <p>Happened to him?</p>, <p>\"You're alive.\"</p>, <p>That was all I managed to utter in the end.</p>, <p>He smiled then.</p>, <p>\"What's with your expression, phecda? Are you mad at how I told you to stick close to me? I had to do it. You didn't pick up any of my messages. We're supposed to start soon.\"</p>, <p>\".....?\"</p>, <p>Phecda? Message? Start soon?</p>, <p>I felt my blood grow cold and my fingers twitched.</p>, <p>'No, this...'</p>, <p>All of a sudden, an idea sprouted in my mind.</p>, <p>\"This isn't the first time you've seen my face. But right, yeah...\"</p>, <p>His expression twisted slightly.</p>, <p>\"I guess you were disgusted by the way I looked. You made that pretty clear back then when you beat me up.\"</p>, <p>A lot of things started to click in my mind all of a sudden. The reason for his fear, and his antagonism towards me.</p>, <p>'Ah, this...'</p>, <p>\"Why aren't you speaking....? You were rather vocal back at the camp when you killed your way to the top. I'm supposed to be following your orders, but you went and outdid yourself didn't you?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>His eerie smile stuck right close to me. His hazel eyes turned, and I felt the back of my neck tingle as my heart started to beat faster.</p>, <p>Slowly my head lowered, and my eyes fell on his forearm.</p>, <p>His clothes were ripped so I could see it well. However, much to my shock, I saw nothing. As if noticing my actions, he frowned and followed my line of sight.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing? Uh? Why are you...\"</p>, <p>He stopped and looked at me.</p>, <p>His expression changed all of a sudden.</p>, <p>But it was too late.</p>, <p>In that split second, my threads were already at his throat. Before he could even react, I clenched my hand as a fountain of red sprayed on me.</p>, <p>Pfttt—</p>, <p>The scent of iron lingered in the air as I felt my face grow wet.</p>, <p>\"Ukh.\"</p>, <p>I took several steps back.</p>, <p>My stomach churned and I hastily closed my eyes.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>....I had to do it.</p>, <p>I repeated such thoughts in my mind. It hardly worked as my stomach continued to churn, but it didn't stop me from repeating it.</p>, <p>'I had to do it.'</p>, <p>It was either me or him...</p>, <p>That much I knew.</p>, <p>My thoughts were further confirmed the moment I opened my eyes again and my gaze once again fell on his forearm. The once clean forearm suddenly changed as a black clover appeared.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I knew then that my guesses had been right and I turned to stare at the tattoo on my arm.</p>, <p>\"What is the meaning of this...?\"</p>, <p>New pieces of information entered my mind.</p>, <p>Pechda? Camp? What sort of situation was this...?</p>, <p>I thought about keeping the conversation going to get more information, but I realized it was a stupid idea. I knew nothing about the organization. A simple slip-up and he would've noticed that I wasn't Julien.</p>, <p>What would happen to me then?</p>, <p>I didn't care to find out and acted swiftly. His guard was down, and his attention was away from his surroundings.</p>, <p>All it took was a simple moment.</p>, <p>....While I didn't expect him to be helpless against my attack, I was still ready for any counter he might've made. His death seemed surprising.</p>, <p>Perhaps, he really didn't think I would kill him.</p>, <p>'Is there some sort of harsh rule that forces members to not kill each other? Is that why his guard was so down?'</p>, <p>If not for that, I didn't think I would've been able to kill him so easily.</p>, <p>Still, his death only brought more questions. There was also the fact that I had to deal with the aftermath of this.</p>, <p>Thankfully, I was the only one aware of Etherwave. I could place the blame for his death on the monsters here. Perhaps even hide the traces of the threads...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>My mind continued to spin in the silence as I forced myself to look at the headless body in front of me.</p>, <p>I took a deep breath and looked at my forearm.</p>, <p>Or more specifically, toward the second leaf.</p>, <p>It was once again shining.</p>, <p>'He may not be alive, but there was a way for me to find more information...'</p>, <p>I pursed my lips and quietly looked up. I didn't want to do it. I hated the sensation that came with understanding another's emotions. But... I had to do it.</p>, <p>To get some clues... I had to do it.</p>, <p>\"I have to.\"</p>, <p>I lowered my hand and placed it over his body.</p>, <p>That's when I pressed the leaf and my world darkened.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Sorry for bad upload rate.

His eyes, though innocent, carried a certain clarity to them as they looked at me.</p>, <p>\".....You're not Julien.\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes before nodding.</p>, <p>\"I am not.\"</p>, <p>The child nodded his head as if understanding the situation.</p>, <p>He looked around him.</p>, <p>\"These were memories I had long forgotten.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I listened in silence.</p>, <p>\"My memories of my family are rather fuzzy. How are they doing right now? Are they healthy? Is my sister okay? Do they still think about me...?\"</p>, <p>His face suddenly changed and I felt my jaw clench.</p>, <p>\"You saw my memories, right? How I got my face.\"</p>, <p>The way he was looking at me...</p>, <p>It made my skin crawl.</p>, <p>\"That hand...\"</p>, <p>His head tilted and I felt my breath stop.</p>, <p>A variety of emotions flooded my chest all of a sudden.</p>, <p>But primarily...</p>, <p>\"....Was it for me or my sister?\"</p>, <p>All I felt was anger.</p>, <p>A strange suffocating feeling overtook me as my chest grew heavy.</p>, <p>\"You've seen her face. Who was the one she was trying to save?\"</p>, <p>His face remained stoic and unchanging, but his anger didn't. It boiled even more ferociously.</p>, <p>\"Was it because she reached faster than me? Was that it? What would've happened had I reached for the hand first?\"</p>, <p>My chest felt like it was ripping apart as his eyes remained glued to me.</p>, <p>\"....Would she have taken my place? Or would I still have been discarded?\"</p>, <p>He disappeared right then as the world turned dark.</p>, <p>But even then, his face didn't.</p>, <p>It remained stuck in my mind. His voice whispering at the back of my mind.</p>, <p>'Who was she trying to save?'</p>, <p>'Me?'</p>, <p>'...Or her?'</p>, <p>In the end...</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 1. [Anger] EXP + 13%</p>, <p>I was never able to answer his question.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>But I had no time to dwell on the question. The moment I regained my vision, I was met with a dozen different eyes staring in my direction from the distance.</p>, <p>I knew then that my path was blocked.</p>, <p>But I didn't care.</p>, <p>I brought my hand forward where five threads slowly came out. A purple magic circle floated above as the threads changed color.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>Staring at the incoming creatures, I clenched my hand.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"....Do you think they're waiting for us down there?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's voice echoed through the empty tunnels, mingling with the sound of their footsteps as they rushed towards the hole up ahead.</p>, <p>She was the furthest one back as Leon led the group from the front.</p>, <p>His expression was hard to read. However, it was clear that he was concerned.</p>, <p>\"I don't know.\"</p>, <p>Leon shook his head.</p>, <p>It had been just a minute since they had managed to defeat the Junior Ranked Nyxfernal.</p>, <p>They held off on collecting the fungi and directly headed down the hole to search for Julien and Wesley.</p>, <p>Thud. Thud.</p>, <p>The moment they touched the ground, all they were met with was darkness. The air was moist, and a putrid smell lingered in the air.</p>, <p>\"Ugh...\"</p>, <p>\"What is this smell?\"</p>, <p>The smell was so horrid that Evelyn had to cover her nose to prevent herself from gagging.</p>, <p>Though she didn't show it directly, Aoife also appeared to dislike it as her nose wrinkled.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...!</p>, <p>There was a faint rippling sound in the distance that caught everyone's attention. It shattered the silence that gripped the surroundings.</p>, <p>Without hesitation, Leon reached out for his bag to take out his torch. He wanted to get a better look at his surroundings.</p>, <p>....And when the light finally shined, he froze.</p>, <p>So did everybody else.</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Looking at the corpses that were littered on the floor, Leon's head slowly raised to stare at the person sitting on top of them.</p>, <p>Drenched from head to toe with blood, his figure twitched the moment light shined upon him.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>His head slowly raised to stare at them and his hoarse voice echoed.</p>, <p>\"You're here...\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"Hey, why did you sto—\"</p>, <p>Evelyn almost bumped into Leon's body as she swiftly stepped to the left in time. She was just about to complain when she found herself stopping at the sight that greeted her eyes.</p>, <p>\"Ah, this...\"</p>, <p>Aoife, Luxon, and the others followed shortly after.</p>, <p>They too wore similar expressions.</p>, <p>\"You did this...?\"</p>, <p>The one who seemed to be in the most shock was Luxon who looked at the corpses littered on the ground in shock.</p>, <p>While they weren't exactly strong monsters, judging from the aura they gave off, there were still a lot of them. Even he felt that it would be difficult for all of them to handle these many of them at once. So for him to be able to do it all by himself...</p>, <p>\"How?\"</p>, <p>He found that hard to believe.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Such was the reality of the situation as Julien calmly stood up from his spot to brush his clothes which were covered in blood.</p>, <p>A strange silence gripped the surroundings as all eyes fell on him.</p>, <p>That was until...</p>, <p>\"Ah...!\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's shout brought everyone back.</p>, <p>\"What? What's going on?\"</p>, <p>The first to react was Luxon who looked at her with a frown. She was looking toward the distance with wide-open eyes as she pointed toward a certain area.</p>, <p>\"T-that...\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>From there, everyone could see what she was pointing at, and their expressions shifted once more.</p>, <p>\"Wesely...?\"</p>, <p>A headless corpse. One that wore a distinctive uniform that could only belong to those who belonged to the Haven Institute.</p>, <p>Almost immediately, all eyes fell on the figure that stood in the middle.</p>, <p>He seemed completely nonchalant about the situation. His eyes weren't even on the corpse or them.</p>, <p>It was his behavior that made all of them grow wary as a sudden thought crossed their minds.</p>, <p>What if...?</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>Leon was the first to call him out. Of everyone present, he was the only one who didn't jump to conclusions.</p>, <p>\"....What happened?\"</p>, <p>Finally, Julien's head turned and their gazes met. As if he understood what he was talking about, he slowly answered.</p>, <p>\"He died.\"</p>, <p>\".....I can see that.\"</p>, <p>Leon slowly blinked.</p>, <p> \"How did he die? Did you...?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Shaking his head, Julien pointed toward a certain direction. Following his line of sight, Leon's eyes jumped up.</p>, <p>It was there that he managed to catch a glimpse of a severed head. One that was badly burned.</p>, <p>\"I wasn't the one who killed him. I'm not capable of doing that.\"</p>, <p>\"No, that makes no sense.\"</p>, <p>Aoife cut the conversation short as she moved towards the severed head. She closely examined it before turning to look at Julien with a frown.</p>, <p>\"These scars... They're obviously healed.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Julien calmly stared at her for a short moment before turning to look at the severed head. For the briefest of moments, Leon saw Julien's face contort. However, he was quick to hide it.</p>, <p>\"Possibly. I didn't have the time to check...\"</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>Aoife glanced at the surroundings briefly before nodding. She didn't seem too convinced but accepted the explanation. Especially when considering how differently the monsters had been slain compared to the corpse.</p>, <p>He could've perhaps done that on purpose, but there was no denying the burned-up face before them.</p>, <p>Julien...</p>, <p>He wasn't capable of doing such a thing.</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, Aoife looked at Leon who looked back at her.</p>, <p>\"For now, let's head back. We'll report this to the institute. They'll do the investigating.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>Leon readily agreed and turned his attention away from Julien.</p>, <p>The same was true for the others who looked anywhere but his direction.</p>, <p>.....There was something about his current demeanor that threw them all off. His eyes especially.</p>, <p>They were cold. Almost detached.</p>, <p>But within them, they could feel a certain rage that they didn't want to address.</p>, <p>They felt...</p>, <p>Maddening.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Please come with us. We will need to detain you until we manage to get a clear understanding of the situation.\"</p>, <p>\".....I understand.\"</p>, <p>The moment we returned from the cave and the situation was reported, I was immediately brought away by the Academy security.</p>, <p>I didn't complain and obliged.</p>, <p>\"Please place your hand over the orb.\"</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>\"Test results... 1.897.\"</p>, <p>\"Mana Density... Tainted.\"</p>, <p>As I continued to undergo testing, a familiar set of results appeared in front of me. This pattern persisted for several hours until I was finally led to a small room furnished with a wooden desk and chair.</p>, <p>\"Someone will come in shortly. Make yourself comfortable in the meantime.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I sat down and closed my eyes.</p>, <p>The lingering traces of the anger I had perceived from the vision began to fade, and I started to feel normal again.</p>, <p>I was confident in my chances of making it out without any problems. I didn't use curse magic when dealing with Wesley. Had I used it... There would've been a strong chance his death would've been linked to me.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>There wasn't. I made sure that to be the case.</p>, <p>It was likely that the Academy would attribute his death to one of the monsters.</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>But that wasn't the only thing they'd be worried about.</p>, <p>The fact that his true face had been revealed probably was what the Academy was investigating.</p>, <p>....They probably didn't care about his death as much as his real identity.</p>, <p>I couldn't blame them. After all, he had managed to sneak in right under their noses. It made me think deeply about the organization I was dealing with and their strength.</p>, <p>Surely, an organization that could sneak in 'spies' in such a prestigious institute had to be extremely powerful. Several times more than the Institute itself.</p>, <p>'The Inverted Sky.'</p>, <p>Was what they called themselves. At least, from what I had managed to glimpse from the memories.</p>, <p>They appeared to be a group of fanatics who kidnapped young children to brainwash them.</p>, <p>Even now...</p>, <p>Thinking about what I had seen, my stomach churned in disgust.</p>, <p>'Evil bastards...'</p>, <p>The memories of the vision remained glued to my mind. Constantly reminded of what I had seen, and just what atrocities they had committed.</p>, <p>There were a lot of things that I had managed to learn from the vision. However, what bothered me the most was the fact that I... No, Julien was part of this very organization.</p>, <p>And he wasn't simply a small member.</p>, <p>'Phecda'</p>, <p>Such was the name I was referred to back in the cave.</p>, <p>What did it mean, and what did it signify...?</p>, <p>I wasn't exactly sure, but... I knew that it meant a rather important position.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I sat in silence staring at the empty desk before me as I felt my back tense.</p>, <p>'They're probably going to come for me soon.'</p>, <p>Wesley and I were supposed to carry a mission.</p>, <p>The fact that he had died and I was present was rather suspicious. However, I knew the moment that I was part of this organization that there was no point in trying too hard to make it seem as though it was an accident and that I wasn't involved.</p>, <p>They weren't stupid.</p>, <p>I was sure they knew I was in some way involved in his death.</p>, <p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>, <p>I drummed my fingers over the wooden desk.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'It's not exactly a bad position.'</p>, <p>This situation...</p>, <p>I could make use of it.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Within this area where the institute's discipline was upheld, several school board members tasked with administering disciplinary measures for the cadets were present.</p>, <p>The accused sat on the other side of the \"invisible glass,\" awaiting his judgment.</p>, <p>He sat quietly behind a desk with a calm face.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus. The Black Star.\"</p>, <p>The accused name and title were read out to the members of the room.</p>, <p>\"How deeply is he involved in this matter?\"</p>, <p>The disciplinary elder, a rough man with a thick frame and bald head stood at the center of the formation.</p>, <p>Besides him, a young man who appeared to still be a cadet held up a piece of paper as he spoke.</p>, <p>\"The results have come back negative. The likelihood of him being the culprit is unlikely. There are no traces of curse magic, and given how cleanly the head had been severed, it is also unlikely to be done by a magician. The biopsy suggests that it's more likely a monster who did it.\"</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>The elder had also read the biopsy and after having observed the corpse, he also believed that to be the case.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>There was something off about the situation.</p>, <p>Something simply didn't add up.</p>, <p>He eventually turned his head toward his right where a woman sat. She had been silent the entire time, and her attention had been on Julien from the start.</p>, <p>\"Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>He called out to her.</p>, <p>Only then did she turn her head to meet his gaze. The elder felt his breath leave his body the moment their gazes met, as an intense pressure bore down on him.</p>, <p>Thankfully, as a high wizard, he was able to remain composed.</p>, <p>Forcing those feelings down, he managed to ask.</p>, <p>\"What do you think about the situation....?\"</p>, <p>A strange silence filled the room shortly after he asked that question.</p>, <p>With her gaze lingering over him for the briefest of moments, she turned her attention back to Julien who seemed to have felt their gazes as he lifted his head.</p>, <p>Then, with a slight tug of her lips, she leaned her cheek on her propped-up fist.</p>, <p>\".....I wonder.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\".....Did you kill him?\"</p>, <p>A familiar woman sat on the opposite end of where I sat. Her presence felt suffocating, and her deep eyes seemed to lure me in the more I looked into them.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Even so, I kept calm. While pressuring, my mind was firm. The vision had messed up with my mind and the resentment I felt from Wesley was still present.</p>, <p>The current me...</p>, <p>Couldn't be fazed by this much.</p>, <p>\"I didn't.\"</p>, <p>My voice came out rather dry.</p>, <p>Delilah's blank face suddenly cracked as her lips gently pulled up. Then, amidst the silence, her finger pressed against the silence.</p>, <p>Tap—</p>, <p>A subtle whistle sounded as the space between the two of us froze.</p>, <p>\"....Alright, you're free to go.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>I thought nothing could faze the current me, but this was an unexpected development.</p>, <p>\"Are you surprised?\"</p>, <p>\".....I wouldn't say I'm not.\"</p>, <p>Surely, while I had hidden my traces quite well, there was still a reason to suspect me as the culprit. At the very least, there was reason to believe I knew something about Wesley's death.</p>, <p>She had even more reason to think so.</p>, <p>Especially when I knew she had seen the tattoo on his arm and that his true face had been revealed.</p>, <p>I thought she was going to mention it during our talk, but she didn't. Rather, she didn't even bring the topic up once and just let me go.</p>, <p>Why?</p>, <p>\"There's not enough evidence to assume you did anything. All of our tests suggest that it's unlikely for you to have done it.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...?\"</p>, <p>\"....We're not unreasonable. Since it seems like it was an accident, we don't have any right to detain you for any longer. You're free to go.\"</p>, <p>Just like that...?</p>, <p>I stayed rooted in my seat for a few moments, attempting to comprehend the situation. I gazed intently at her expression, which resembled that of a blank piece of paper, before gradually rising from my seat.</p>, <p>\".....Okay.\"</p>, <p>There were a lot of things that I wanted to ask, but decided otherwise.</p>, <p>I knew she had some answers to some of the questions I had, but I chose to remain silent. It was still too risky. I didn't have enough leverage for myself, and how would I even explain to her my situation?</p>, <p>For what reason would she even believe me?</p>, <p>It was with such thoughts that I stood up from my seat and bid her farewell.</p>, <p>For now...</p>, <p>I needed to thread carefully.</p>, <p>It wasn't the right time yet. I knew it was going to come soon.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p> In the ensuing silence following Julien's departure, Delilah continued to fix her gaze on the door of the room.</p>, <p>She could see the surprise etched on the faces of the school board members from the other side of the door as they closely stared at the leaving Julien. She didn't blame them. The choice to release him rested solely on her shoulders.</p>, <p>But it wasn't without any reason.</p>, <p>Primarily, she knew that it would've been a wasted effort. If he did do it, there was no chance he was going to come clean.</p>, <p>There was also not enough evidence to pin the blame on him...</p>, <p>Since that was the case, why hold him in for longer?</p>, <p>Delilah cared a lot for her time.</p>, <p>Since it was just going to be a massive waste of time, she let him go. As if she was going to let those old bastards take her weekend again.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Delilah kept those thoughts to herself.</p>, <p>But outside of that, there was something else that intrigued her.</p>, <p>\".....An internal conflict?\"</p>, <p>While she couldn't prove Julien's role in the cadet's death, she was more or less certain that he had played a part in it.</p>, <p>And... if that was the case, then did that mean that there was some sort of internal conflict within the organization?</p>, <p>Or maybe, he was someone who had betrayed the organization.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Delilah couldn't fathom why Julien had never bothered to conceal the tattoo on his arm. Despite the organization being known to only a select few important figures within the empire, she was certain that if anyone discovered the tattoo on his arm, he would have hell for it.</p>, <p>The fact that he never intended to hide it was what aroused Delilah's curiosity the most.</p>, <p>She felt like there were a lot of possibilities for such a situation. Perhaps there was an internal conflict between the groups within the Inverted Sky.</p>, <p>....Or perhaps he was a traitor.</p>, <p>Maybe it was just a random tattoo he got and he had no part in all of this at all.</p>, <p>Delilah wasn't exactly sure the exact reason, but...</p>, <p>\"....I'll know soon.\"</p>, <p>Of that she was sure.</p>, <p>Regardless of what he did, his actions were sure to bring those from the Inverted Sky over to the Institute.</p>, <p>All would become clear then. Whether he was with them or not, or a traitor... It would all become clear the moment they came.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that she let go of him.</p>, <p>Whether he was an enemy, she wasn't so sure anymore.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>That didn't matter anymore. She had to get ready now. They were coming, and while she didn't know when or how she knew it was only a matter of time.</p>, <p>\"Finally...\"</p>, <p>Delilah's eyes flashed coldly.</p>, <p>\"....I've got something.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>In light of the events that happened, I was given a day off.</p>, <p>I took that chance to leave the Academy. I had a certain destination in mind. Taking the train from the Academy to Lens, I took a change and headed for 'Rosea'.</p>, <p>Located two hours from Lens, Rosea was a much smaller town located near a sizable mountain range.</p>, <p>The air was fresh and greenery covered the surroundings.</p>, <p>I retraced my memories and walked along a small path. It was a place I had never been before, but I knew exactly where I was and the path I was following.</p>, <p>Soon enough, the remains of a large mansion appeared within my sight.</p>, <p>\".....I'm here.\"</p>, <p>I could still picture the mansion in my mind.</p>, <p>It stood tall and grand, capturing the attention of all that passed.</p>, <p>....Such was how it was before the vision.</p>, <p>Right before the flames came.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>The silence that gripped the surroundings felt stifling, but I paid no attention to it.</p>, <p>I just felt like I had to be here.</p>, <p>It brought me a strange peace of mind. Especially towards the anger and rage that was gripping my chest.</p>, <p>Even now...</p>, <p>I was still under the effects of the vision.</p>, <p>The anger that had been transmitted to me refused to leave.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>I stepped around the mansion and looked around. The entire structure lay in ruins with charred spots all over the place. Vegetation had already started to reclaim the remnants of what was once a grand and imposing mansion.</p>, <p>Eventually, my steps halted.</p>, <p>I stood before a headstone.</p>, <p>[In loving memory of William Kenneth]</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I gripped my chest.</p>, <p>The anger that resided in my chest threatened to boil all over all of a sudden. A voice echoed within the depths of my mind.</p>, <p>'Which one was she trying to save...?'</p>, <p>'Me.'</p>, <p>'....Or her?'</p>, <p>'Who?'</p>, <p>The voice continued to whisper within my mind as I had the sudden urge to break the headstone apart in front of me.</p>, <p>Unknowingly, my jaw clenched tightly and so did my fists.</p>, <p>'Who?'</p>, <p>Even I was starting to question this.</p>, <p>But it all stopped by a sudden voice.</p>, <p>\"Who... are you?\"</p>, <p>I turned my head to see a young girl with long black hair standing not so far from where I was. Her appearance seemed vaguely familiar.</p>, <p>\"....What are you doing in front of my brother's tomb?\"</p>, <p>Brother...</p>, <p>I closed my eyes for a brief moment.</p>, <p>'Right, it's her.'</p>, <p>Eleonora Kenneth.</p>, <p>William Kenneth's sister and the little girl in the vision.</p>, <p>I lowered my hat to hide my face.</p>, <p>\"I was just passing by when I saw this place. It seems like an unfortunate event has happened here.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes. It's been over a decade since.\"</p>, <p>She walked up to the tombstone and sat down. Then, under my watch, she placed a rug over the stone and started cleaning it.</p>, <p>The way she cleaned the stone seemed to be extremely thorough. As though she was treating an extremely precious object.</p>, <p>I broke the silence between us.</p>, <p>\"You must really care about your brother.\"</p>, <p>\"....Uh?\"</p>, <p>Her movements stopped and she turned to look at me.</p>, <p>I didn't mind and continued.</p>, <p>\"How old was he?\"</p>, <p>She was hesitant at first, but glancing at the headstone in front of her, her eyes lowered and she answered.</p>, <p>\"...My brother was just eight then. I was six.\"</p>, <p>\"You must've forgotten about the incident then. So long has happened.\"</p>, <p>I could hardly remember anything from back when I was six.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Unexpctantly, Eleonora did.</p>, <p>\"....I remember everything. I've never forgotten.\"</p>, <p>Perhaps because the topic was brought up, she recalled the events in her mind.</p>, <p>Her lips pursed, and her arms trembled slightly.</p>, <p>\"I... can never forget that day. It haunts me every day.\"</p>, <p>She blinked rapidly to hide her tears.</p>, <p>But I could see them from where I was.</p>, <p>\"It's my fault... I-f I hadn't started to fire... If Mother had taken his hand instead of mine...\"</p>, <p>Tears welled up in her eyes as she started to choke on her words.</p>, <p>\"I shou—\"</p>, <p>\"He never resented you.\"</p>, <p>I cut her off dryly.</p>, <p>\"Ah...?\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"What are y—\"</p>, <p>\"Not once.\"</p>, <p>I stared at the headstone in front of me.</p>, <p>He had never once resented his sister for taking the hand.</p>, <p>\".....He was happy you were safe.\"</p>, <p>He resented the idea of her going through something he had had he taken the hand.</p>, <p>Not that she had taken the hand instead of him.</p>, <p>\"And he's also happy that you still think about him.\"</p>, <p>His mother may have abandoned him.</p>, <p>But she hadn't.</p>, <p>The feelings that boiled within my chest started to ease.</p>, <p>It no longer felt as suffocating.</p>, <p>\"W-why are you saying this...?\"</p>, <p>Eleonora choked on her words. Her eyes were red, and her hands were trembling. I could see that the events of the past had been eating at her every day as well.</p>, <p>He wasn't the only one.</p>, <p>I smiled then.</p>, <p>I didn't need to pretend to be Julien. I could smile now.</p>, <p>\".....I know because I felt what he felt. It's part of my ability. I felt it in his soul right now.\"</p>, <p>I didn't mind lying a little.</p>, <p>Because it was partly true.</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>The rug fell and she began to cover her eyes with both hands as tears finally streamed down her face.</p>, <p>\"B-brother... Ah...\"</p>, <p>Her sobs echoed quietly in the surroundings.</p>, <p>I felt my lips quiver slightly and I looked up at the sky.</p>, <p>'Neither one resents each other for what happened.'</p>, <p>They truly were...</p>, <p>Siblings.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I had no obligation to do this. I didn't feel responsible for his death. I had done what needed to be done to survive.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I was also human.</p>, <p>I needed to do this for myself.</p>, <p>\"T-thank you...\"</p>, <p>Suddenly, I heard a soft whisper.</p>, <p>For some reason, it hit my feelings.

            "[<p>It was a quiet journey back to the Academy.</p>, <p>I allowed myself to sink into my thoughts, gazing blankly at the shifting scenery outside the window of the moving train.</p>, <p>Before I knew it, the sun had started to set and I was finally back at the Academy.</p>, <p>I took in my surroundings before finally heading for the dorms.</p>, <p>The walk wasn't very long. About a five-minute walk. The surroundings were quiet, and I basked in the silence that surrounded me.</p>, <p>It felt oddly peaceful.</p>, <p>That was until...</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I passed a certain figure and I found my steps pausing.</p>, <p>I turned around and our eyes met. Long platinum hair, red eyes, and a face that one wouldn't forget even if they tried.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>Kiera Mylne.</p>, <p>She looked at me with her usual scowl.</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>Then, with a click of her tongue, she tapped the cigarette in her hand against the ground.</p>, <p>Tzzzz—</p>, <p>\"Happy now?\"</p>, <p>\".....I didn't say anything.\"</p>, <p>I was starting to learn to not let such things bother me. While the smell that lingered in the air still made me feel nauseous, I was starting to learn to take it.</p>, <p>I had no right to force someone to do something against their will.</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>But Kiera didn't seem to think the same way as me.</p>, <p>\"Your fucking expression says it all.\"</p>, <p>\"Does it...?\"</p>, <p>And here I thought I had kept my expression firm.</p>, <p>\"...Tsk.\"</p>, <p>She clicked her tongue again and flicked the cigarette away.</p>, <p>\"Whatever, I don't feel like smoking anymore. You've ruined the mood for that.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I didn't say anything to that.</p>, <p>All I did was pause for a second and suddenly she lost all interest in smoking.</p>, <p>That was on her not me.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right.\"</p>, <p>Kiera paused all of a sudden as she recalled something. Rummaging through the pocket of her skirt, she took out something and tossed it to me.</p>, <p>\"Here. I think this is yours.\"</p>, <p> I caught it with one hand and looked at it.</p>, <p>\"What is this?\"</p>, <p>It appeared to be a torn shoulder pad.</p>, <p>Was this...</p>, <p>\"It's yours.\"</p>, <p>It sounded like she was quite certain of it.</p>, <p>\"I saw you when you were coming back from the expedition. You were missing a shoulder pad. I found it in an area where a lot of monsters were killed. Gruesome shit.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I remained quiet and took my gaze away from the shoulder pad and back to her.</p>, <p>\"You know what's crazy?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"The injuries of the monsters I found coincide with that guy's death. You know, that Weasel guy?\"</p>, <p>Weasel guy?</p>, <p>\"Wesley.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, right. Yeah, that guy.\"</p>, <p>She traced her thumb across her neck.</p>, <p>\"Clean as shit. Never seen anything quite like it. Well, I did. The wound looked eerily similar to the ones from the monsters I found the shoulder pad in\"</p>, <p>I knew then what she was trying to imply and I felt my muscles grow tense. Though I didn't show it outwardly, Kiera still smiled. It was as if she could read my inner thoughts.</p>, <p>I thought she was going to push things further from there, but surprisingly, she didn't.</p>, <p>\"Whatever though. None of my business.\"</p>, <p>Yawning, she stretched her body.</p>, <p>\"None of my fucking business. Was just saying.\"</p>, <p>Then, as if the conversation had never happened, she left.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence for a brief moment before staring at the shoulder pad in my hand. I thought this before, but she really was a...</p>, <p>\"Crazy bitch.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>Darkness engulfed the room as the door closed. Kiera blinked twice before reaching for the switch and turning the light on.</p>, <p>The dark.</p>, <p>She didn't like the dark.</p>, <p>The moment the light came on she felt her chest lighten.</p>, <p>\".....Ah.\"</p>, <p>She looked at her room. It was extremely clean. Contrary to her messy appearance, Kiera liked to keep things organized. If even the slightest thing was disorganized, she'd lose focus over everything and would think about it all day.</p>, <p>It was something she was born with.</p>, <p>\"Uh...\"</p>, <p>She had just taken a step into her room when she noticed something.</p>, <p>Fiddling with her pockets, she smacked her head.</p>, <p>\"Fuck.\"</p>, <p>Without hesitation, she rushed towards one of the drawers in the room and opened it.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>But there was nothing inside.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>The same was true for the drawers beneath.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>They were completely empty.</p>, <p>\"Fuuuuck.\"</p>, <p>She...</p>, <p>Had run out of cigarettes.</p>, <p>And it was too late for her to get any because it wasn't the weekend yet.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Kiera slumped down on her bed and blankly stared at the ceiling. She was fucked. Royally fucked. Cigarettes were like medicine to her... They were what kept her panic attacks from occurring.</p>, <p>Without them, she was...</p>, <p>\"Fuck, it's all that bastard's fault.\"</p>, <p>No, it wasn't.</p>, <p>But she wanted to blame someone. At the very least, it would make her feel better.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus. He was like a piece of wood. His expression was hard to read. She had been sure about her accusations. That it was not an accident. He was the one who had killed Weasel.</p>, <p>On the outside, he appeared to be a victim just like him, but Kiera was confident of her conjecture.</p>, <p>\"But who am I to care...?\"</p>, <p>It was none of her business to begin with.</p>, <p>All nobles were like that. Rotten on the inside.</p>, <p>She wasn't one to rat out people like that. Especially since the evidence she gathered wasn't going to hold up well.</p>, <p>It was just...</p>, <p>Interesting.</p>, <p>\"....He's stronger than he lets out.\"</p>, <p>Right, he was the Black Star. The number was on within the first years, but it was a general consensus within the first years that he was the weakest.</p>, <p>His results proved that to be the case and a reason why there was doubt about his involvement in Weasel's death.</p>, <p>Kiera thought so too.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>As she recalled the images she'd witnessed back in the mirror dimension, she found herself smirking.</p>, <p>\"What a load of bullshit.\"</p>, <p>The guy was a snake.</p>, <p>There was more to what he let on than people thought. For what reason was he hiding his strength, she wasn't sure.</p>, <p>Nor did she particularly care.</p>, <p>So long as he didn't involve her in his bullshit she was going to not care.</p>, <p>Still, it was an interesting thought.</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>Mumbling his name, Kiera closed her eyes.</p>, <p>\"....You owe me one.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The next day.</p>, <p>While Leon was waiting for the Professor to come.</p>, <p>\"How many funghi did we manage to collect?\"</p>, <p>\"About seven.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn and Aoife were busy discussing the splits of their finds.</p>, <p>\"Seven...? That would mean that there's one in excess.\"</p>, <p>\"Hmmm. We would've been even if he...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn paused there, but the meaning behind her words was clear. Had Wesley still been alive, then all shares would've been equal.</p>, <p>The only problem was that he wasn't.</p>, <p>Aoife, while staring at the mushrooms displayed on the table, suddenly turned her head and asked,</p>, <p>\"What do you think?\"</p>, <p>\"I don't know. I'll think about it later.\"</p>, <p>Class was about to start soon.</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned before nodding her head. Then, recalling something, she quietly asked,</p>, <p>\"There's work experience next week. Have you selected which place you want to go to?\"</p>, <p>\"....I'm a knight.\"</p>, <p>Leon answered flatly.</p>, <p>Of all the people present, he was the only one who didn't need to attend the mandatory work experience that everyone had to attend.</p>, <p>Why?</p>, <p>Because he was already working.</p>, <p>\"Ah, right.\"</p>, <p>Aoife turned her head to briefly stare at the front where a lonesome figure sat.</p>, <p>As always, he was by himself. He was staring at the front with no particular expression.</p>, <p>\"Is it tough to be his knight?\"</p>, <p>The question attracted the attention of those around.</p>, <p>They all seemed somewhat curious.</p>, <p>Leon thought about the answer. Had it been before, he would've answered yes without a doubt, but the current Julien...</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Right, the current Julien was different.</p>, <p>However, the two of them still needed to keep their act.</p>, <p>\"Doesn't surprise me.\"</p>, <p>Aoife deliberately sighed.</p>, <p>\"Oh, looks like the class is full~\"</p>, <p>A middle-aged lady entered the classroom all of a sudden. She was tall, and despite her aging features, she still was quite beautiful.</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette. In charge of today's class, [Understanding of Spells], the students favored her due to her bubbly personality.</p>, <p>Arriving by the podium at the front, she set her files down and cleared her throat.</p>, <p>\"Before we start the lecture, I have an announcement that I want to make. Please pay attention.\"</p>, <p>Her words seemed to have had an effect as the class quieted down. She smiled as a result and continued.</p>, <p>\"As you may know, in a month the Guild Lantern Festival will begin.\"</p>, <p>Leon's eyes narrowed upon hearing the name of the event.</p>, <p>His body slightly tensed as his gaze wandered to Aoife who was staring at the front with a straight face.</p>, <p>'Looks like there isn't much time left.'</p>, <p>Something big was going to happen on that day.</p>, <p>And it was something that directly involved Aoife. He was sure of it.</p>, <p>\"A lot of important figures will be coming, and we must set a good impression on them.\"</p>, <p>The Guild Lantern Festival was an academy-wide event that was hosted by the academy each year and invited all the top officials from the fifteen major guilds.</p>, <p>They weren't the only people that were set to come as celebrities and important figures were also set to attend.</p>, <p>It was a 'must attend' event that couldn't be missed.</p>, <p>\"Outside of the combat analysis that will take place, I've discussed it with the other departments and we've got several events that you can take part in for extra credits.\"</p>, <p>The classroom immediately became rowdy at that. In order to pass the first year, one had to accumulate a total of 110 credits.</p>, <p>Each class held different weights. For example, this class held about 8 credits. And they could only be accumulated through passing the examinations.</p>, <p>It was tough to collect credits.</p>, <p>It was also for this reason that the eyes of the many people in the class lit up at the mention of possible credits.</p>, <p>Even Leon felt his back straighten.</p>, <p>\"The events are as follows.\"</p>, <p>Unfurling a piece of paper, Professor Bridgette began to read.</p>, <p>\"Food preparation. Your job will be to host a stand and sell food that you produced.\"</p>, <p>Leon shook his head.</p>, <p>Wasn't very interested.</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>He turned his head to see Aoife sweating. She seemed to be glaring in a particular direction. Following her line of sight, he was surprised to see her looking at Julien.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Why...?</p>, <p>\"Next up is play. The Language department is looking for suitable people to carry out a play in English.\"</p>, <p>He didn't pay further attention as the professor continued to list the events.</p>, <p>That too didn't sound very interesting.</p>, <p>Leon felt that his English was decent at best.</p>, <p>\"Next up is Parade. You can help out the seniors who are planning on....\"</p>, <p>\"Cultural exchange. Create or bring some products of your hometown to share with...\"</p>, <p>\"Children's activities. There will be a lot of younger...\"</p>, <p>The list went on and the more Leon listened the more he shook his head.</p>, <p>Parade? Didn't care.</p>, <p>Cultural Exchange? The Evenus Barony hardly had any cultural products.</p>, <p>Children Activities? He already had a hard time dealing with Julien.</p>, <p>There wasn't anything that was suitable for him.</p>, <p>He frowned.</p>, <p>'Should I just choose something easy...?'</p>, <p>At this rate, it would be his only option.</p>, <p>Or so he thought.</p>, <p>\"Talent activity. Display your talent at the theater. From special talent, to even a stand-up routine....\"</p>, <p>From the corner of his eyes, Leon caught a glimpse of Julien's figure.</p>, <p>He had been rather calm the entire time while listening to the events. However, the moment the 'stand-up routine' was mentioned, his body twitched.</p>, <p>It was as if he was planning something.</p>, <p>\"....It can't be.\"</p>, <p>Leon unconsciously muttered those words out loud.</p>, <p>\"Leon?\"</p>, <p>Enough to warrant the attention of Evelyn who was close to him.</p>, <p>But he didn't care.</p>, <p>No, he couldn't care.</p>, <p>\"It's an event that's hosted by the comedy club, but they didn't specify who can participate. So long as you want to participate, you can sign up and...\"</p>, <p>Julien's head raised again.</p>, <p>\"Oh, no...\"</p>, <p>Leon felt his body grow cold and the hair at the back of his neck stood.</p>, <p>\"If anybody is in—\"</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>\"Leon!?\"</p>, <p>Leon found himself standing abruptly.</p>, <p>He could feel the gazes of everyone in the classroom directed his way. But he didn't care. He stared straight at the professor who tilted her head at him.</p>, <p>\"The comedian part...\"</p>, <p>Leon slowly started to say as his gaze lowered to meet Julien's.</p>, <p>Julien wore an expression that seemed to say, 'You? A comedian? What joke is this...?'</p>, <p>Leon felt even more reassured about his decision as he firmly gripped the side of the desk and muttered through his clenched teeth.</p>, <p>\"...I'll do it.\"</p>, <p>For the sake of everyone present.</p>, <p>\"The stand-up. I'll do it.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>'Has this guy lost it...?'</p>, <p>Such were the thoughts of everyone in the classroom as they stared at Leon who had abruptly stood up at the opportunity of becoming the stand-up for the talent show.</p>, <p>I shared similar thoughts with the others.</p>, <p>'This guy is biting more than he can chew.'</p>, <p>What comedian?</p>, <p>He hardly even changed his expression. Furthermore, he always seemed to be against my jokes.</p>, <p>With someone who had no sense of humor, how could he even be a comedian?</p>, <p>\"Are there any objections?\"</p>, <p>The class was quiet from that point. Nobody seemed to have any objections. Mainly because it was Leon who had volunteered.</p>, <p>One could argue his voice held more weight than mine.</p>, <p>On the other side of the classroom, Professor Bridgette seemed shocked by Leon's sudden decision to take part in the role.</p>, <p>But she was quickly delighted.</p>, <p>\"If it's you, then it would be amazing! With your reputation and look, the seats will be filled in no time.\"</p>, <p>\"....Ah, yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded. Was it just me or did it seem somewhat awkward?</p>, <p>'Wait...?'</p>, <p>A sudden thought crossed me and I felt my brows furrow.</p>, <p>I turned to look at the professor who was mumbling to herself.</p>, <p>\"Yeah, this is great... I'll let the organizers know so that they can put it on the list...\"</p>, <p>\"Professor.\"</p>, <p>I interrupted her thoughts.</p>, <p>All of a sudden I felt the eyes of all present directed towards me.</p>, <p>\"Julien? Is there something you'd like to add?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>I nodded and turned to look at Leon whose eyes started to widen slightly.</p>, <p>\".....I'm just a little skeptical. Is he capable of making jokes? I would like to hear something fro--\"</p>, <p>Snap--</p>, <p>I was interrupted by a small snapping sound. When I turned to look, I noticed that the pen in Leon's hand had snapped in half.</p>, <p>His expression remained the same.</p>, <p>\"Leon...?\"</p>, <p>When Professor Bridgette addressed him, his expression changed a little as he looked at his pen.</p>, <p>\"It snapped.\"</p>, <p>\"I can see that.\"</p>, <p>\"A mystery.\"</p>, <p>The fuck is this guy on about?</p>, <p> He was about to say something else when she cut him off.</p>, <p>\"But Julien has a point. Do you have anything to share? A small sample?\"</p>, <p>I added fuel to the fire.</p>, <p>\"I'd be willing to take his place if he doesn't wa--\"</p>, <p>Snap--!</p>, <p>The pen snapped into smaller pieces.</p>, <p>\"I'll do it.\"</p>, <p>I held onto my stomach. It was cramping for some reason.</p>, <p>\"Kh.\"</p>, <p>\"That's great.\"</p>, <p>The Professor seemed even more excited. Clap--! Clap--! She clapped twice to gather the attention of everyone in the class.</p>, <p>\"If everyone would quiet down for a second. I'd like us to hear a sample.\"</p>, <p>The classroom fell silent then. With all eyes on Leon, he stood rigidly on his spot.</p>, <p>I too looked at him.</p>, <p>I was curious. He seemed to always trash my jokes. How much better were his jokes to think that?</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>He silently swallowed before looking around. Then, clenching his fists, he lowered his head to mumble something.</p>, <p>\"...do... call... fish... eyes...\"</p>, <p>Given how low his voice was, it was hard to understand what he was trying to say.</p>, <p>\"I couldn't quite catch that. What did you say?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I watched as Leon's jaw tensed under the Professor's words. Then, as if he has resigned himself to his fate, he spoke,</p>, <p>\"What do you call a fish with no eyes?\"</p>, <p>I felt my eyes widen all of a sudden.</p>, <p>It couldn't be...</p>, <p>\".....fsh.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>The entire class was engulfed in a strange silence as the eyes of all those present widened.</p>, <p>The way some people looked at Leon changed. Especially Professor Bridgette who seemed taken aback.</p>, <p>Leon on the other hand tried his best to keep his expression straight.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>In the silence that ensued after he said his joke, I found myself frowning intensely. I felt a sudden sense of crisis.</p>, <p>This guy...</p>, <p>\"...He stole my joke.\"</p>, <p>What bullshit.</p>, <p>It was one of my favorites too.</p>, <p>\"Ah, this...\"</p>, <p>Following the awkward silence that plunged the classroom, Professor Bridgette forced a smile.</p>, <p>\"Well, it was a great attempt.\"</p>, <p>Her words also seemed rather forced.</p>, <p>\"Ehm, so... I'll talk to the comedy club. We'll.. ah, see how things will go from there. I'll let you know then, okay?\"</p>, <p>\"...Yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon quietly nodded his head before sitting down. I took a moment to look around me. Everyone was staring at Leon with complicated expressions. It was as though they couldn't believe he had actually done what he did.</p>, <p>I was taken aback.</p>, <p>'Was the joke not good...?'</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>And then I understood.</p>, <p>Delivery.</p>, <p>\".....He messed up his delivery.\"</p>, <p>Snap--!</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>The class proceeded from there. For now, Professor Bridgette left the festival selection list by the podium saying something along the lines of, 'We'll figure this out later... I'll talk with the other departments. You can come fill it up whenever you want. Even after class.'</p>, <p>Nobody brought up the situation since.</p>, <p>The class began.</p>, <p>\"Spells. What do we know about spells?\"</p>, <p>A hand raised immediately the moment the Professor asked the question. I didn't need to turn to know who it was.</p>, <p>\"Aoife.\"</p>, <p>Who else would it be but her?</p>, <p>With stellar grades in almost everything, she would've been the Black Star if not for me and Leon.</p>, <p>\"As we know, there are five stages to a spell. Beginner, intermediate, advanced, superior, and perfected.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes, and what else?\"</p>, <p>\"The difference among spell categories lies in the number of runes each possesses. Beginner spells comprise twelve runes, while intermediate spells include eighteen. Advanced spells entail twenty-four runes. Superior spells contain thirty runes, and finally, perfected spells consist of precisely forty runes.\"</p>, <p>I paid close attention to the words that were being said. Although I knew it, it was still important.</p>, <p>\"Correct.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette clapped enthusiastically.</p>, <p>\"As expected of you Aoife. Well done.\"</p>, <p>Just then, when I turned around, faintly, I saw the corner of Aoife's lips pull up. She tried to hide it, but it was obvious that she was happy with the praise.</p>, <p>It was kind of cute.</p>, <p>\"Now then...\"</p>, <p>The lecture continued.</p>, <p>\"Since everyone already knows the basics, I'll ask a different question.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette looked around the classroom.</p>, <p>\"Who here can tell me the requirements for learning an intermediate spell and up?\"</p>, <p>A hand raised up again.</p>, <p>It was Aoife again.</p>, <p>\"....Aoife.\"</p>, <p>\"The requirement corresponds to your tier.\"</p>, <p>She went on to give a detailed explanation.</p>, <p>\"An Apprentice is restricted to learning beginner-type spells due to their low mana capacity. A Master Mage can advance to learning Intermediate ranked spells. High wizards are eligible for advanced-ranked spells. Arch-Wizards have access to superior ranked spells, while only a Monarch can harness a Perfected ranked spell.\"</p>, <p>I frowned all of a sudden.</p>, <p>There was something about her explanation that didn't quite make sense to me.</p>, <p>Her next words served to prove that.</p>, <p>\"It's crucial not to waste too much time learning too many spells. After all, mastering even one spell requires a significant investment of time, and as you progress, the number of spells you'll need to learn only increases.\"</p>, <p>What sort of...</p>, <p>I felt my brows furrow further.</p>, <p>A lot of the information that was being said I knew. However, it wasn't as though I knew everything.</p>, <p>I had been learning a lot of stuff, but not everything.</p>, <p>That was why I suddenly raised my hand. There was something that was bugging me.</p>, <p>\"Julien? Do you have a question?\"</p>, <p>\".....I do.\"</p>, <p>Sorting out my thoughts, I suddenly asked.</p>, <p>\"Can spells be upgraded?\"</p>, <p>The thing was...</p>, <p>I actually was already capable of using an intermediate-ranked spell.</p>, <p>[Sadness]</p>, <p>At tier 1, I was still an apprentice-ranked mage. To become a Master Mage I needed to reach Tier 3.</p>, <p>Was it just because the Emotive Field was different? But then...</p>, <p>Hands of Malady — Lvl. 1 [18%]</p>, <p>Chains of Alakantria — Lvl. 1 [0%]</p>, <p>Why...?</p>, <p>Why was there a Lvl. 1 written beside the two spells? No, all my spells...?</p>, <p>Could it be...</p>, <p>\"Upgrade a spell?\"</p>, <p>My thoughts were broken by the Professor who tilted her head and looked at me strangely. She wasn't the only one who looked at me like that. Half of the class was.</p>, <p>Some were frowning, while others were looking at me weirdly.</p>, <p>I knew the answer then.</p>, <p>But the Professor continued.</p>, <p>\"....It's not possible. You can't upgrade a spell from beginner to intermediate. As you know, spells have different sets of runes. All runes are connected and form a perfect balance. Adding more would simply destroy the spell.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I unknowingly let out a strange sound.</p>, <p>It suddenly struck me then.</p>, <p>My spells...</p>, <p>\"I see, thank you.\"</p>, <p>I could upgrade them.</p>, <p>'This...\"</p>, <p>I felt my heart race at the thought and all noise from my surroundings drowned out.</p>, <p>'I didn't pay much attention to it because of everything else that I was learning, but my spells..... they can be upgraded. And I'm the only one that can do it...'</p>, <p>What did that mean? Why me?</p>, <p>And what would happen if the spells upgraded?</p>, <p>Would they change to a fundamental level, or would they remain the same but stronger?</p>, <p>The sadness spell went from only working when touching to working with just my voice.</p>, <p>What would happen if it were upgraded further?</p>, <p>\"Huh.\"</p>, <p>The thought suddenly made my breath feel heavier.</p>, <p>I quietly called up the status window to look, and another thought suddenly crossed me.</p>, <p>Would it be possible for me to learn intermediate-ranked spells as an Apprentice? If so...</p>, <p>I silently gulped.</p>, <p>Clap—! Clap—! It was the sudden sound of hands being clapped that broke me out of my thoughts and I looked up. Professor Bridgette was smiling, looking at the clock on the right side of the classroom.</p>, <p>\"We've got thirty minutes left to class. I think that's enough for me today. I'll give you the remaining thirty minutes to practice your spells for yourself.

            "[<p>The thirty minutes we had at our disposal flew by faster than I had anticipated.</p>, <p>Tzzzz—!</p>, <p>Immersed in my practice, I barely heard the Professor's words.</p>, <p>\"Would you look at that? The class has ended. You may leave if you wish to. If there are any questions you can ask me. I'll be here for a few more minutes.\"</p>, <p>She went on to press her hand against the podium.</p>, <p>\"If you haven't by now, please put your name on the list. I'll leave it here for today. I'll be here to collect it tomorrow morning.\"</p>, <p>The class became rowdy then, and it was only once I heard the noise that I fully realized it was the end of the class.</p>, <p>\"Hua… I'm so tired~\"</p>, <p>\"Tell me about it. Good thing I don't have anything after this. I think I'll go eat something at the canteen.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh, I'll join you.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, right. Before we leave let's sign up for the event.\"</p>, <p>\"Alright.\"</p>, <p>I frowned and looked up.</p>, <p>The conversations were disrupting my concentration. I sighed then and leaned back on the chair.</p>, <p>I thought back on what I managed to accomplish in class.</p>, <p>And…</p>, <p>'…..Not much progress.'</p>, <p>I was still stuck at eleven runes.</p>, <p>I hardly accomplished anything in the thirty minutes that were given to me.</p>, <p>The last rune simply just refused to connect.</p>, <p>Unlike last time though, I was able to learn to manage my frustration. The more well-learned I was about an emotion, the more I could control it.</p>, <p>For this reason, I wasn't disheartened. Having already experienced the intense frustration that came with failure, it took a lot more than this to get me frustrated.</p>, <p>\"Hmmm.\"</p>, <p>I looked at my timetable.</p>, <p>There was no other class that I needed to attend.</p>, <p>\"Should I….?\"</p>, <p>I looked around me. The noise in the classroom was starting to quiet down. The place was big, and I felt more refreshed staying here.</p>, <p>Since I didn't feel like going back, I decided to stay behind and practice more.</p>, <p>As the class started to empty, I felt the gazes of the other cadets on me as they left, probably wondering why I was still there.</p>, <p>It felt a little disturbing, so I waited for all of them to leave before resuming my practice.</p>, <p>Only then did I feel at peace and once again started to practice.</p>, <p>Rune One—Rune Two—Rune Three…</p>, <p>This time...</p>, <p>\"....I'm going to succeed.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p> In life, there were highs and lows that one experienced.</p>, <p>It was something that came with age. The older one got, the higher the chances of them experiencing a low.</p>, <p>Leon today experienced a low.</p>, <p>\"What the hell was that…?\"</p>, <p>Feeling Evelyn's gaze, he found himself turning his head away from her. She was the only one who even bothered to stay back to talk to him. Everyone else just left.</p>, <p>\"Did you seriously think that was funny?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Leon pursed his lips.</p>, <p>How could he tell her that he had no jokes prepared and panicked? The only reason he had volunteered in the first place was to stop Julien from joining.</p>, <p>He hadn't expected Julien to retaliate like that.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Leon frowned and found himself clenching his fists.</p>, <p>If only he had been ready...</p>, <p>He wouldn't have used Julien's joke had he been ready.</p>, <p>Though…</p>, <p>\"Heh.\"</p>, <p>He felt his stomach cramp a little recalling the face Julien made when he stood up to volunteer.</p>, <p>The look of hurt and betrayal on his face…</p>, <p>\"Hehe.\"</p>, <p>It made him chuckle unknowingly. All until he felt a certain gaze. It bore through his face and stung quite a lot.</p>, <p>\"You…\"</p>, <p>As expected. A horrified Evelyn met his gaze. Her face was pale, and she took several steps back.</p>, <p>\"Don't tell…\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Leon cut her off and tried to explain himself.</p>, <p>'I was laughing at the face Julien made.'</p>, <p>But stopped himself from speaking.</p>, <p>How exactly could he say that...?</p>, <p>Misunderstanding his inner struggle, Evelyn took another step back as realization dawned on her.</p>, <p>\"So you really did laugh at Julien's joke back then.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's face scrunched up. She seemed to want to say something but stopped and sighed.</p>, <p>\"Promise me something, Leon. Just… don't sign up for the stand-up. I don't know why you want to do it, but you're just not fit for it.\"</p>, <p>Before he even had the chance to say anything, Evelyn left.</p>, <p>The only thing he could remember as she left was the disappointment in her face as she looked at him.</p>, <p>It...</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>At that moment, Leon raised his head to stare at the tall ceiling.</p>, <p>There was only one thought that ran through his mind then.</p>, <p>\"…..I saved them.\"</p>, <p>Yeah.</p>, <p>He was a hero.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Late into the evening.</p>, <p>It was already dark outside and the training grounds were empty.</p>, <p>Mostly.</p>, <p>Clank!</p>, <p>A large metallic noise resounded throughout the expansive grounds as a large black box dropped on the ground with a loud sound.</p>, <p>The surroundings shook slightly as it bounced on the hard ground.</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip.</p>, <p>The sound was accompanied by the patter of sweat dropping and the sound of heavy breaths.</p>, <p>\"Haaa… Haa...\"</p>, <p>Aoife stared at the box in front of her with a pale face.</p>, <p>\"Fifty kilograms…\"</p>, <p>That was her current limit. It was the heaviest her telekinesis powers could go up to.</p>, <p>However, it was meaningless.</p>, <p>While it was indeed the heaviest she could go, her control was not there.</p>, <p>35kg was her comfort weight. The weight where she could freely control the box. It wasn't much, but as a borderline Master Mage, this was her limit.</p>, <p>Any more and she would lose all control. That would mean she'd only be able to lift the item, but not move it.</p>, <p>Drip! Drip…!</p>, <p>Sweat continued to drip down her face as she brushed her hair away from her face. It was sticky from all the sweat.</p>, <p>\".....I think it's time.\"</p>, <p>Aoife checked the time. It was 10 P.M, almost curfew time.</p>, <p>'Right, I need to fill in the form.'</p>, <p>The one for the festival.</p>, <p>Her original plan was to do it after dinner, but she had been so immersed in her training that she forgot.</p>, <p>\"Hopefully, the list is still there.\"</p>, <p>It should be.</p>, <p>She was just about to clean up when her pocket vibrated. Frowning, she reached into it and took out a small orb.</p>, <p>Her brows immediately jumped up and she hastily tapped onto the orb.</p>, <p>An illusionary face appeared. A handsome man with short red hair and distinctive yellow eyes appeared.</p>, <p>\"Brother?\"</p>, <p>He was none other than her brother, Gael K. Megrail.</p>, <p>Immediately, Aoife cleared her throat and fixed her hair. It was something she did unconsciously.</p>, <p>\"Is there a reason for why you've called me?\"</p>, <p>—Is there a reason for me to call my little sister?</p>, <p>An all-familiar smile greeted her. Aoife attempted to smile back but found herself unable to.Especially when she noticed how pale his expression was.</p>, <p>Her fists clenched.</p>, <p>\"How are you doing...?\"</p>, <p>—Haha, I'm fine. What are you so worried about?</p>, <p>He raised his right arm and flexed.</p>, <p>—My mana may be sealed, but my body isn't. Look at this!</p>, <p>All Aoife saw was a skinny arm. There was hardly any muscle.</p>, <p>She forced a smile again.</p>, <p>\"Looks good...\"</p>, <p>—Oh, come on. I can tell you're lying.</p>, <p>\"I'm not.\"</p>, <p>He cocked his head.</p>, <p>—It's obvious.</p>, <p>\"It's not. \"</p>, <p>Aoife insisted while trying to keep her face straight.</p>, <p>—Haaa... What am I going to do with you?</p>, <p>In the end, he resigned himself and sighed.</p>, <p>—Fine, you win. You weren't lying.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Aoife finally found a small smile. However, it didn't last for very long. Especially when she took note of his cheeks which had started to sunken.</p>, <p>'....Brother.'</p>, <p>She secretly bit her lips.</p>, <p>He hadn't always been like this. There had been a time when he was the center of attention. The crown prince and the next in line for the throne.</p>, <p>If only...</p>, <p>Her fists clenched tightly and an image appeared in her mind.</p>, <p>With an arrogance that was fitting of someone of her talent, she stood before her father.</p>, <p>'Seal his mana.'</p>, <p>He, the Emperor of the Empire, could do nothing but helplessly stare at her.</p>, <p>Her talent was too dazzling.</p>, <p>The stronghold her family had was starting to shatter. A new power started to emerge and they could do nothing about it.</p>, <p>'Remember. I know my worth. If you want to keep me in this Empire then you're better off meeting my demands. You can try eliminating me now, but I doubt you'll be able to. When the time comes, I'll join another Empire.'</p>, <p>Even now she could recall her arrogant voice as it echoed throughout the halls of the royal palace.</p>, <p>'I'm not being unreasonable. I just want to see how committed you are in wanting to keep me. Suppress his mana just as you did to the commoners. Do it for five years and you'll have my loyalty.'</p>, <p>A figure stepped up.</p>, <p>'I'll do it, father. Please let me do it.'</p>, <p>Aoife clenched her fists.</p>, <p>She had only been fifteen then. Three years had passed since, and every day those memories haunted her.</p>, <p>She remembered everything. From the helpless expression of her father to the resigned look of her brother who, despite being more talented than her, had no choice but to stop practicing mana for the next five years.</p>, <p>Five years didn't sound like much, however, for someone like her brother who had a large mana pool, sealing his mana was equivalent to crippling him.</p>, <p>His body which was accustomed to the high mana started to fail him, resulting in his current condition.</p>, <p>—Cough...! Cough!</p>, <p>\"Brother!\"</p>, <p>Aoife's face changed.</p>, <p>—Cough... I'm fine. Don't worry. It's just... the usual.</p>, <p>However, seeing how adamant her brother was, she could only bite her lips and watch as he held a tissue next to his mouth.</p>, <p>—Anyways... cough... I just wanted to see how you were doing at the institute. Seeing your current state, you must've been training. I guess I won't take any more of your time.</p>, <p>\"Ah, no it's fine.\"</p>, <p>—Just do your thing. Call me whenever you need something.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>—Oh, and...</p>, <p>He paused to look at her. Aoife met his gaze back.</p>, <p>—....Don't resent your father for the decision. It's something I agreed to do as well.</p>, <p>Aoife frowned.</p>, <p>—Just focus on yourself and don't think about revenge. She... isn't someone you are capable of catching up to.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Aoife clenched her teeth tightly. She was just about to rebuke him when his face disappeared.</p>, <p>—Remember my words. Make sure you eat well and don't resent father too much! The last thing Aoife saw was his smiling face.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Silence plunged her surroundings as she stood in the training grounds without saying a word.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>In the end, all she could do was out a long sigh.</p>, <p>\"....As if I can forgive him.\"</p>, <p>her father...</p>, <p>He was just as guilty as she was.</p>, <p>That much was clear to her.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Cleaning up after herself, Aoife headed straight for the Dorset Hall.</p>, <p>There were several activities that she had in mind for the festival, but in the end, she settled for the 'Guide' position.</p>, <p>Her job was rather simple.</p>, <p>All she had to do was guide people around the Academy campuses.</p>, <p>It was an important position. One that many coveted. With many important figures attending, the 'Guide' was the role that enabled cadets to interact with them.</p>, <p>Of course, Aoife didn't need such a position given her background.</p>, <p>However, it was also because of her background that she felt compelled to do this job. She was, after all, acquainted with most of the attending people.</p>, <p>It wouldn't hurt to choose it.</p>, <p>\"It should be this classroom.\"</p>, <p>Her feet stopped in front of a familiar door. The corridors were empty, and it was pretty dark.</p>, <p>Reaching for the door, she opened it and prepared to enter when she stopped.</p>, <p>\"Mh?\"</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip...!</p>, <p>A certain dripping sound caught her attention and when she looked inside to see where it was coming from, her eyes shot open.</p>, <p>\"Almost...\"</p>, <p>Off by the far end of the classroom, a familiar figure sat. His back was straight, and his facial features could only be described as 'flawless'.</p>, <p>He was a man Aoife struggled to understand, as he rarely displayed any expressions.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>\"....Again.\"</p>, <p>Here he was, sitting in the middle of the classroom, wearing a different expression than his usually stoic one.</p>, <p>His focus was on his hand where a set of runes were floating in the air. They were slowly interconnecting with each other to form a circle.</p>, <p>'Is he trying to unlock a spell...?'</p>, <p>That was what it seemed.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Why is he bleeding?\"</p>, <p>Unlocking a spell wasn't that difficult. At the very least, it wouldn't need someone to force themselves to the point of bleeding.</p>, <p>As she counted the number of runes, she was also sure that it wasn't an intermediate-ranked spell.</p>, <p>'He's struggling with unlocking a beginner rank spell...?'</p>, <p>Was that even possible?</p>, <p>Tzzzzz--!</p>, <p>Aoife frowned after witnessing the circle shatter.</p>, <p>Drip...!</p>, <p>More blood dripped down from his nose.</p>, <p>'Is this the limit to his talent?'</p>, <p>It wasn't as though she didn't expect this, but it was somewhat disappointing given the many surprises he had given her.</p>, <p> She thought he was going to stop there, but...</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>He continued.</p>, <p>\"Uh?....Is he crazy?\"</p>, <p>Aoife felt her eyes widen. Staring at his arms which were trembling, his pale face, and bleeding nose, Aoife forgot all about her goal and stood rooted behind the door.</p>, <p>She started to grow curious all of a sudden.</p>, <p>For how long was he going to keep this up?</p>, <p>\"Again...\"</p>, <p>Another circle shattered.</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip...!</p>, <p>More blood dripped down from his nose.</p>, <p>His usually stoic expression was replaced by one of pure focus and determination.</p>, <p>It was as if he was a completely different person than how he normally showed himself.</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>Regardless of how many times he failed, he'd wipe his nose and continue.</p>, <p>It was as if he didn't care at all about himself.</p>, <p>Even as his entire body trembled, and his eyes turned bloodshot, he continued. The only thing he could mutter seemed to be, 'again'.</p>, <p>\"....Crazy. Lunatic.\"</p>, <p>It was all Aoife could think about when staring at him. She couldn't understand why he was putting himself through such trouble.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>Even though she thought all of that, she found herself unable to tear her gaze off of him.</p>, <p>There was something about his current appearance that struck her deeply.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Time continued to pass.</p>, <p>\"Again.</p>, <p>Failure became the norm, and blood continued to drip down his nose. Even so, Aoife continued to watch in silence as he tried each time.</p>, <p>Even as he failed, he continued to try.</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>Nothing changed.</p>, <p>He still failed.</p>, <p>And just as she thought he was going to fail again, something happened.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>Bang--</p>, <p>Julien abruptly stood up.</p>, <p>He stared at his hand where a magic circle formed.</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>An expression she had never seen him make before.</p>, <p>A smile she had never thought was possible.</p>, <p>\"Hahaha.\"</p>, <p>And laugh that she never thought he was capable of making.</p>, <p>Aoife stood dumbfounded in her spot.</p>, <p>Taking in his expression, she unknowingly found herself mumbling something under her breath.</p>, <p>\"....So he can make a face like that too?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"I... did it....\"</p>, <p>I stared at the completed circle resting on my hand.</p>, <p>I couldn't believe it...</p>, <p>....I had actually done it.</p>, <p>\"Hahaha.\"</p>, <p>I laughed. I didn't know why I laughed, but I just did.</p>, <p>Drip...!</p>, <p>Feeling my nose run again, I wiped the blood away and finally started to pack up. I looked around and saw that it was completely dark outside.</p>, <p>How long...?</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>I checked my watch and realized it was almost past curfew. I hastily packed up my stuff and dashed to the dorms.</p>, <p>Even as I returned back to the dorm, I was still shaken by the sudden development. I hadn't expected myself to succeed. I had grown so used to failure that when success did come, all I felt was bafflement.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I looked at my hand and a purple magic circle was slowly starting to form.</p>, <p>The mana inside of my body started to drain at a rapid pace but I didn't mind it as something was starting to form in my hand.</p>, <p>Clank. Clank. Clank.</p>, <p>A peculiar metallic rattle resounded as purple chains began to materialize within the grasp of my hand.</p>, <p>Clank!</p>, <p>The process took no longer than several seconds and by the time all was said and done, I found myself holding a long chain.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stared at the chains with a frown.</p>, <p>\"How does this work?\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes for a moment and followed the link that connected my mind to the chain. In the darkness of my vision, all I saw was a long purple line. It was bent in a '∩' shape.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Finding the connection, my brows twitched and my hand shook slightly.</p>, <p>Clank...! Clank...!</p>, <p>The chains started to move.</p>, <p>At my will, they followed everything my mind told them to do.</p>, <p>They could both lengthen and shorten at my command. However, the mana consumption for such a move was rather high. Frowning, I settled for just the right length. About the size of my arm.</p>, <p>I opened my eyes and stared at my arm where the chains were coiling.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I clenched my hand into a fist. The chains glowed a strange purple hue. I knew from the description of the spell that it had a similar effect to [Hands of Malady] in the sense that it weakened an opponent upon contact.</p>, <p>However, unlike [Hands of Malady] it wasn't a long-range skill.</p>, <p>\"Not that it matters.\"</p>, <p>I slowly clenched my fist and stared at the chains coiling my arm. I started to think about all the possibilities that came with the skill when I suddenly felt lightheaded.</p>, <p>\"....Ah, right.\"</p>, <p>The chain shattered and I sat down on my bed.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>The mana expansion was no joke.</p>, <p>Just a few minutes and I was already low on mana.</p>, <p>\"I guess I'll put it off for now.\"</p>, <p>My mind was not in the right state of mind to figure the skill out. I planned on leaving it for tomorrow.</p>, <p>There was something else that I needed to pay particular attention to at the moment.</p>, <p>I reached out to grab a paper from the desk and stared at it.</p>, <p>\"Work Experience.\"</p>, <p>Who would've thought I'd be looking for a job again?</p>, <p>Work Experience. It was a mandatory event that we needed to take part in according to the Professors. It was an event that was supposed to last for a week, and depending on our performance, credits would be awarded to us.</p>, <p>\".....Looks like I have to do it.\"</p>, <p>I needed as many credits as possible.</p>, <p>My knowledge was rather 'primitive' compared to the other cadets. Coupled with the amount of time I spent each day training, I hardly had enough time to study.</p>, <p>I tried my best, but...</p>, <p>\"It's not enough.\"</p>, <p>I was desperate for credits.</p>, <p>\".....What should I choose?\"</p>, <p>The list wasn't very long. About a single page with over thirty listings. I was just about to go through the list when the world around me froze.</p>, <p>'Uh?'</p>, <p>I lost my voice and a familiar feeling gripped me.</p>, <p>'A vision....? All of a sudden?'</p>, <p>No, when did they ever have a good time? They always came randomly and when I least expected them to. I sighed and embraced the incoming vision.</p>, <p>\"It was a disaster.\"</p>, <p>An unfamiliar voice echoed, and my surroundings started to change. It was dark, and the air felt damp.</p>, <p>'A room...?'</p>, <p>No, it felt more like a cell. A prison cell.</p>, <p>Why would...</p>, <p>\"How many have managed to escape?\"</p>, <p>\"Five in total. Two Extreme-risk, one High-risk, and two low-</p>, <p>risk.\"</p>, <p>Escaped? Five...? Extreme risk, high risk, low risk? The information, while scattered, did make sense in some way.</p>, <p>My surroundings started to become clearer as I found myself inside an empty prison cell. It was just as I expected it.</p>, <p>This was a prison.</p>, <p>Two people stood by the cell looking around. Wearing similar uniforms, they were probably rather high-up in the prison system.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... This is a fucking mess. Central has been calling non-</p>, <p>stop demanding some answers. The same is true for Haven.\"</p>, <p>Haven...?</p>, <p>Why would Haven...</p>, <p>\"Ten cadets died in the escape. They're demanding answers. I don't blame them. They were here for work experience, and nothing should've happened considering our reputation, but...\"</p>, <p>The individual sighed again.</p>, <p>\"....What an embarrassment. Not only were we able to keep our prisoners in check, but we also got students involved in this mess.\"</p>, <p>Students?</p>, <p>'Oh god.'</p>, <p>Realization dawned on me and I felt my tighten.</p>, <p>A quest was coming, wasn't it?</p>, <p>\"Not only did we fail at our jobs, but we also got children involved in our incompetence.\"</p>, <p>He was clearly distressed by the situation, but it wasn't what I wanted to hear at the moment. I wanted to hear more. More information about the situation.</p>, <p>I had a few leads at the moment.</p>, <p>The event was set to happen in a week. During the work exchange. It was in a prison, and five inmates escaped.</p>, <p>I knew the danger level of the inmates but didn't know their identity.</p>, <p>This...</p>, <p>It wasn't enough.</p>, <p>I strained my ears to listen more.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right.\"</p>, <p>With a sudden halt of his steps, one of the guards suddenly looked up. He seemed to have something to say.</p>, <p>I strained to listen even more carefully.</p>, <p>\"One of the prisoners that escaped...\"</p>, <p>My heart dropped when I noticed a change in my surroundings.</p>, <p>No, not yet!</p>, <p>The surroundings began to darken, and the guard's voice started to fade. In that moment, I knew the vision was about to end.</p>, <p>But I hadn't heard enough.</p>, <p>Not yet!</p>, <p>I used every little bit of willpower to strain my ears to listen.</p>, <p>Just a little more...</p>, <p>A little...</p>, <p>\"....Wasn't he a Professor from Haven?\"</p>, <p>The vision ended there and I found myself back in my room.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haa...\"</p>, <p>My breath was heavy, and my head felt light. However, thinking back upon the vision, I found the corner of my lips gently pulled up.</p>, <p>\"...I heard it.\"</p>, <p>The last few words.</p>, <p>I had managed to hear them.</p>, <p>My vision flickered moments after and a notification appeared.</p>, <p>[ ◆ Side Quest Activated : Prison Escape.]</p>, <p>: Character Progression + 21%</p>, <p>: Game Progression + 3%</p>, <p>Failure</p>, <p>: Calamity 2 + 7%</p>]\n",

The quests...</p>, <p>They revolved around the three calamities.</p>, <p>\"There might be more to it.\"</p>, <p>For now, that was all I knew.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I didn't do anything rash like tipping the prison about a possible prison break. Even if I did send it anonymously, I doubted they would truly believe my words.</p>, <p>And even if they did believe me, who was to say that it was the end goal of the mission...?</p>, <p>\"I can't act rashly.\"</p>, <p>At least, not yet.</p>, <p>\"Hmm...\"</p>, <p>As I continued to stare at the quest window, a sudden thought broke my attention and I felt my brows jump.</p>, <p>\"Character progression twenty-three percent.\"</p>, <p>That...</p>, <p>I hastily looked at my current experience and felt my heart pause.</p>, <p>Level :19 [Tier 1 Magician]</p>, <p>Exp : [0%—[18%]100%]</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>With the Blue ranked book and my increasing mastery over it, my rate of progress was about 5% a day.</p>, <p>'If I focus my entire attention on it I might be able to push it to 8 to 9 percent, but that would require I drop everything else and reduce the amount of time I sleep...'</p>, <p>With the 23% character progression upon completing the quest, then...</p>, <p>\"I'd be able to move to the next tier.\"</p>, <p>The idea caused my heart to beat a little faster. It brought a strange sense of excitement.</p>, <p>According to what I had been told, leaping to the next tier was a monumental stride. My strength would undergo a large change.</p>, <p>Not only would my mana capacity increase but so would my control and speed at which I could create the spells.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Thinking about the pains I would go through in the coming week, I let out a long breath. I knew it was going to be a painful and boring week for me, but...</p>, <p>\"I have to do this.\"</p>, <p>It was about time that I progressed to the next tier.</p>, <p>I was tired of being stuck at tier 1.</p>, <p> ***</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>Reflected between Kiera's ruby-red pupils was the orange tip of her cigarette as she sat by the window to stare at the night sky.</p>, <p>The moon shined bright, casting a white land over the land beneath.</p>, <p>It felt oddly peaceful.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>Kiera basked in the sight, her red pupils flickering slightly as they fell on the piece of paper by her desk—[Work Experience Selection Program].</p>, <p>There was a long list of possible jobs one could select for the program. Some were easy, and some were hard.</p>, <p>It didn't particularly matter to Kiera though.</p>, <p>Since the start, she already had one in mind.</p>, <p>\".....Redknap Penitentiary.\"</p>, <p>Two words escaped her lips as she took another drag of the cigarette. As the bitter taste lingered on her tongue and the burn coursed down her throat, she exhaled slowly.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>She chewed on those words.</p>, <p>There was someone waiting for her there.</p>, <p>Someone who she hated with every fiber of her being. Even Aoife didn't stand a chance against her.</p>, <p>Just the thought of her made her chest burn with intense hatred.</p>, <p>\"I'll kill her.\"</p>, <p>That much she promised to herself.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>With one last drag, Kiera flicked the cigarette away and exhaled, the smoke covering the view in front of her.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Her ruby-red eyes gleamed brightly beneath the veil of smoke that covered her face. A frigid cold lay hidden beneath those beautiful eyes as she went on to mutter,</p>, <p>\".....If it's the last thing I'll do.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A week passed without any trouble.</p>, <p>\"Huaam.\"</p>, <p>Yawning to myself, I stared at the experience bar in front of me.</p>, <p>Level :19 [Tier 1 Magician]</p>, <p>Exp : [0%[79%]100%]</p>, <p>I felt proud staring at the experience bar in front of me. Having dedicated every little hour that I had to achieve this, I cut down on my sleep and spell training.</p>, <p>Though work experience was set to last a whole week, I didn't think that I would be able to get much time to practice for myself. It was for this reason that I tried my best to get to this point.</p>, <p>I didn't want to take any risks.</p>, <p>\"Looks like everyone is here.\"</p>, <p>The Professor in charge was someone I was unfamiliar with. He stood tall, with long brown hair framing a chiseled face, and a muscular physique. His hair was somewhat disheveled and he wore a lazy expression. He looked like someone who didn't want to be here.</p>, <p>No, maybe he really didn't want to be here.</p>, <p>Wearing the same uniform all professors wore, he scanned the group which consisted of about fifty cadets.</p>, <p>'There's quite a lot.'</p>, <p>I looked around me to scan the faces of all those present. I was looking for either Kiera or Aoife. Whoever was set to be here had to be the second calamity.</p>, <p>So who...</p>, <p>\".....Eh.\"</p>, <p>I paused to look ahead. Two figures stood out from the rest, and I felt my face stiffen slightly.</p>, <p>Right, as if my life was supposed to be easy.</p>, <p>Massaging my forehead, I sighed.</p>, <p>\"They're both here.\"</p>, <p>Aoife and Kiera.</p>, <p>Leon too.</p>, <p>He had been avoiding me for the entire week for some strange reason. I tried to talk to him several times, but he'd just silently stare at me before leaving.</p>, <p>His attitude was confusing.</p>, <p>So was his appearance here.</p>, <p>'No, not really.'</p>, <p>As the main character, it made sense for him to be present. But why were both Kiera and Aoife present...?</p>, <p>There were so many other jobs that they could select, yet almost everyone chose to work at the prison.</p>, <p>Was there something that I was missing, or was this just the power that Leon held?</p>, <p>'I guess I just have to be patient.'</p>, <p>I was bound to find the answer sooner or later.</p>, <p>With such thought, I looked up at the Professor who had started to speak.</p>, <p>\"We will now be departing for the penitentiary. We've already discussed matters with them, and your role will involve assisting the guards in patrolling the perimeter. Due to safety concerns, you will only be assigned to guard the low-risk areas. Please ensure that you do not provoke any trouble during your time there.\"</p>, <p>The Professor's gaze turned stern.</p>, <p>\"Don't be swayed by their words, and do your utmost to avoid interaction with the prisoners. You're not dealing with ordinary individuals. You're dealing with scum—people who have forsaken their humanity.\"</p>, <p>There was an obvious disgust in his tone as he spoke about the prisoners. A bad experience maybe? Or was it that he had been there so many times and seen many things to speak like that? I wasn't quite sure.</p>, <p>But I didn't pay further attention to his words. My gaze continued to linger between Kiera and Aoife.</p>, <p>Between the two of them...</p>, <p>Who was the second calamity?</p>, <p>Wooom—!</p>, <p>The gentle humming sound snapped me out of my thoughts, and I turned to see the Professor extending his hand to his right.</p>, <p>The space in front of him folded, and a gate the same size as him appeared.</p>, <p>'Wait, could that be...?'</p>, <p>\"I've set up a portal. You can enter from here and you will find yourself in front of the penitentiary. Please enter one at a time.\"</p>, <p>I found my mouth parting slightly at the sight that bore before me.</p>, <p>A portal...?</p>, <p>Such a thing was possible?</p>, <p>No, it made sense for it to exist, but still...</p>, <p>'Can I do that in the future?'</p>, <p>It was a thought that stuck with me even as I lined up behind the other cadets and waited for my turn in line.</p>, <p>In the meantime, I overheard the conversation between a few cadets ahead of me.</p>, <p>\"What do you think?\"</p>, <p>\"I'm kind of scared, I won't lie. Do you think we'll get to see the high-security prisoners? There's quite a few big names in there.\"</p>, <p>\"Hu... I'm getting shivers thinking about them.\"</p>, <p>\"Haha, what can happen? This is a maximum security prison. There's no way they can escape.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The more I listened, the more I felt the urge to smack my forehead.</p>, <p>What the hell was this conversation? Was it just some dialogue written in the script of the game to foreshadow what was set to happen?</p>, <p>If so...</p>, <p>I wasn't sure how to feel. Surely, there were better ways, right?</p>, <p>\"Next.\"</p>, <p>Before I knew it, it was almost my turn.</p>, <p>I was just about to step forward when I noticed a figure standing beside the portal.</p>, <p>She was staring at it with incredible focus.</p>, <p>'Aoife?'</p>, <p>I stepped near her and asked,</p>, <p>\".....Are you not going in?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>She looked at me before frowning.</p>, <p>\"I am.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>I extended my hand.</p>, <p>\"You can go first.\"</p>, <p>Suddenly, her frown deepened and she made a disgusted expression.</p>, <p>\"What? I don't need your pity. I can go when I want to.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>The hell was her problem?</p>, <p>Similarly frowning, I was just about to ignore her when I suddenly realized something.</p>, <p>\"It can't be that you're too sca—\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>She cut me off before I could finish my sentence.</p>, <p>I looked at her in surprise.</p>, <p>\"Really...?\"</p>, <p>\"I said no.\"</p>, <p>Aoife appeared adamant.</p>, <p>I nodded.</p>, <p>\"Then you can go first.\"</p>, <p>\"Why should I?\"</p>, <p>\"Because you were ahead of me in line.\"</p>, <p>At that, a vein popped on Aoife's temple. She stepped back to look at me.</p>, <p>\"....Like I said, I'll go when I want to. I don't need the likes of you to tell me what to do.\"</p>, <p>Her eyes briefly glanced at the portal where they shook. It was only slightly, but I caught it.</p>, <p>Oh.</p>, <p>She really was scared.</p>, <p>But how...? Wasn't she a Princess? Wasn't something like this normal for her?</p>, <p>\"Go. Stop wasting everyone's time.\"</p>, <p>\"Alright...\"</p>, <p>\"Good.\"</p>, <p>She appeared satisfied then.</p>, <p>\"It wasn't so hard was it?\"</p>, <p>I was just about to step in when I stopped and frowned.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>I continued to stare at the portal with a frown.</p>, <p>\"There's something...\"</p>, <p>\"Something?\"</p>, <p>It was enough to warrant Aoife's curiosity as she too looked at the portal.</p>, <p>\"What? Where—Uh!!?\"</p>, <p>As soon as she turned to gaze at the portal, I pushed her.</p>, <p>\"Hieek...!\"</p>, <p>She let out a shriek as her body lurched forward and vanished into the swirling vortex.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Looking at the Professor who pretended to not have seen a thing, I nodded at him and stepped in.</p>, <p>For some reason...</p>, <p>That felt satisfying.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>There wasn't much that I knew about the penitentiary.</p>, <p>The location was undisclosed, and only a select few knew the exact coordinates of the place. Some speculated that it was located in the middle of an island while others speculated it was located inside a mountain range.</p>, <p>There were a lot of rumors about the place, but nobody knew the real location.</p>, <p>Wooom—</p>, <p>I came out of the portal feeling a little wobbly.</p>, <p>It felt as though my organs had flipped over. Thankfully, nothing came out of that and I was able to recover rather quickly.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I looked up to stare ahead.</p>, <p>Before us a large wall loomed, stretching across several kilometers. At its forefront, imposing gates greeted our sight, flanked by stationed guards.</p>, <p>'So this is the entrance of the penitentiary.'</p>, <p>It was rather imposing.</p>, <p>\"Follow along... Follow along...\"</p>, <p>I never had the chance to properly admire them before the Professor's lethargic voice brought me back. Scratching his head, his eyes drooped slightly.</p>, <p>\"Let's get you all registered...\"</p>, <p>Scratching his hair, he just seemed tired of life.</p>, <p>I couldn't blame him. I was feeling the same way. Especially when I felt a pair of eyes burning holes at the back of my head.</p>, <p>I paused and looked back.</p>, <p>\"Get over it.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"It was an accident.\"</p>, <p>\"An accident?\"</p>, <p>Aoife, who was glaring at me, clenched her teeth and finally spoke.</p>, <p>\"Do you really expect me to believe that?\"</p>, <p>\"Sure you can. You tripped over your feet.\"</p>, <p>At that, Aoife's usual blank look showed signs of cracking. She appeared to be on the verge of losing it, but...</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, she suppressed her anger and left.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stared at her for a brief moment before tilting my head.</p>, <p>'She's definitely mad.'</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>It was worth it.</p>, <p>\"By the way...\"</p>, <p>Her steps continued even as I spoke.</p>, <p>\"....If you're scared, I can help you out agai-\"</p>, <p>\"Uht!\"</p>, <p> She ended up tripping on her feet and losing balance. Just barely, she managed to keep herself from falling face flat and recovered rather quickly. Her head flicked back as she glared at me.</p>, <p>\"I wasn't scared.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Sure she wasn't.</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>I nodded, ready to leave things be, when suddenly, I felt the back of my blazer get pulled, and her face appeared inches away from mine. Like a wild animal, she bared her teeth at me.</p>, <p>\"I. was. not. scared.\"</p>, <p>Her teeth didn't open once as she spat those words out.</p>, <p>\"Not.\"</p>, <p>Just then...</p>, <p>Almost faintly, I felt the corners of my lips pull.</p>, <p>\".....if you say so.\"</p>, <p>\"I say so.\"</p>, <p>Her face inched closer.</p>, <p>I nodded.</p>, <p>\"Sure.\"</p>, <p>\"I wasn't.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>\"Good.\"</p>, <p>\"Perfect.\"</p>, <p>\"Excellent.\"</p>, <p>Where was this conversation going? Perhaps realizing this too, Aoife finally let go and stepped back.</p>, <p>\"Good that you know.\"</p>, <p>Then, acting as if nothing had happened, she proceeded to head into the penitentiary.</p>, <p>Of course, she didn't forget to add a few words before leaving.</p>, <p>\"....Remember, I wasn't scared.\"</p>, <p>I stared at her back for a short moment before shaking my head and following from behind.</p>, <p>'Sure you weren't.'</p>, <p>That small incident aside, as soon as we passed through the gates, our bodies were subjected to a comprehensive check. I was stripped down to my underwear and thoroughly searched by the guards who used a device that scanned my entire body.</p>, <p>For obvious reasons, males and females were separated.</p>, <p>The process was rather quick and lasted less than several minutes. However, those short minutes felt like forever as I felt uncomfortable the entire time.</p>, <p>\"Has everyone been checked?\"</p>, <p>Another door greeted us the moment we stepped out of the checking room.</p>, <p>After doing a head check, the professor began to give a final speech.</p>, <p>\"Behind me are the doors that lead to the lower security hall of the prison. It's where you all will be staying and guarding the place. Like I said before, try your best to minimize your contact with the inmates. They are not good people. Don't fall for their sweet temptations.\"</p>, <p>As he spoke, a guard stepped up and took out a large set of keys which he quickly inserted into the door.</p>, <p>Click!</p>, <p>It was sealed shut so I couldn't see what was behind it, but seeing the tense expressions the guards were making, I knew it was going to be something I wouldn't forget.</p>, <p>\"For your first day, you won't need to do much.\"</p>, <p>As the door was getting unlocked, the Professor continued to give us instructions.</p>, <p>\"All you have to do is get familiar with the place. The current area is called the Manticore Residential Area. It's where the Low-risk prisoners will be held. You are to not step outside of this zone.\"</p>, <p>Click— Click—!</p>, <p>\"While you won't be in danger if you step out of the zone, there is still a risk that something might happen. We will not be held responsible for your safety if you wander around in areas you aren't supposed to be. Of course, we'll try to stop you from leaving, but if you somehow can go out undetected, if anything happens to you, then it's on you.\"</p>, <p>The Professor's eyes fell on each and every one of us before turning back to face the door which slowly started to open to reveal what was behind.</p>, <p>\"....Welcome to Redknap Penitentiary.\"</p>, <p>\"Huuuuuuu!\"</p>, <p>As the door to the inmate's residential area swung open, a torrent of shouts and jeers engulfed us like a tidal wave.</p>, <p>\"The rats are back!\"</p>, <p>\"Hahahaha, you fuckers aren't tired of seeing my face already?\"</p>, <p>\"Look! There's a bunch of kids behind them.\"</p>, <p>\"Hahahaha.\"</p>, <p>Amidst the jeers and shouts, a palpable sense of intimidation settled in as the prisoners regarded us with eyes brimming with malice.</p>, <p>It felt rather discomforting. Especially when I started to become the subject of a few jeers.</p>, <p>\"Hahaha, look at that pretty boy!\"</p>, <p>\"His face is stiff as a rock! Hahaha, he must be pissing his pants from fear.\"</p>, <p>\"Been a while since I've seen such beautiful girls. Come to me. I'll let you have a great time. Kakaka.\"</p>, <p>The ones who seemed the most uncomfortable were the girls who showed looks of disgust.</p>, <p>Well, most of them...</p>, <p>There was one exception.</p>, <p>\"Keke, look at these fuckers. They know a looker when they see one.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Kiera.</p>, <p>She was...</p>, <p>Enjoying this?</p>, <p>\"Haha, little miss, why don't you come to my cell?\"</p>, <p>\"Pftt, please. Take a look at yourself dickhead. You look like an oversized ball sack.\"</p>, <p>\"What did you call me?!\"</p>, <p>\"Kakaka.\"</p>, <p>Smacking her thigh, she started to laugh.</p>, <p>\"Holy shit! I didn't think you could make yourself look ever worse than that, but here you are...! Kakaka.\"</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>\"You bitch!\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I tried my best to ignore her, but she really was a...</p>, <p>\"Crazy bitch.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, the Professor intervened.</p>, <p>\"Don't rattle them. Your job is to keep them in line, not anger them.\"</p>, <p>\".....T-ah.\"</p>, <p>Just then, she was about to click her tongue but stopped herself when realizing who she was talking to. I couldn't help but find her expression amusing as her face scrunched up as a result.</p>, <p>It looked like she had just eaten shit.</p>, <p>Snap— Snap— Snapping his fingers to gather our attention, the Professor spoke.</p>, <p>\"You may disperse and start to familiarize yourselves with the surroundings. For now, your role won't be anything big. If you see any of the inmates starting a fight, it's your job to break it up. All of them have their mana sealed so it shouldn't be a problem for you to deal with them.\"</p>, <p>Or so he said. However, knowing what I knew, I didn't let my guard down and made sure to be on full alert the entire time.</p>, <p>\"Alright, off you go. Wander around and familiarize yourself with the surroundings. If you have any problems come find me. I'll be at the guard station.\"</p>, <p>With a lazy wave of his hand, the Professor finally left.</p>, <p>\"He's finally gone.\"</p>, <p>\"Hey, do you want to team up with me?\"</p>, <p>\"Let's go.\"</p>, <p>From there, all the cadets went their own separate way. Most of them went in groups of four that they formed after the Professor's absence.</p>, <p>I was one of the only few who remained alone.</p>, <p>Well, it was something that I had expected and desired. I looked around me.</p>, <p>\"For now, I need to get a better idea of my surroundings.\"</p>, <p>I planned to meticulously learn all the details of my surroundings. While I didn't know exactly where the escape was going to happen, every little bit of information helped.</p>, <p>In fact, there was something that I needed to prioritize before that.</p>, <p>There was a certain person that I wanted to meet.</p>, <p>That I had to meet.</p>, <p>\"Heh.\"</p>, <p>'I wonder if he still remembers me.'</p>, <p>I wasn't sure. Back then, all of it happened due to the skill. I was still not sure whether the time I spent with him was something that he remembered.</p>, <p>Was the person I met his subconscious or just a manifestation of it? Something that the skill had created to mimic how he'd react?</p>, <p>I wasn't sure, but I was about to find out.</p>, <p>However, if he truly did remember, then...</p>, <p>\"....It'll turn everything around.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>After separating from the other cadets, Kiera walked around to monitor the area. It had been several hours since, and she was somewhat starting to get accustomed to the surroundings.</p>, <p>As she scanned the surroundings, a voice echoed.</p>, <p>\"Look at you~\"</p>, <p>A whistle followed.</p>, <p>\"Come here and have some fun with me. I promise I don't bite.\"</p>, <p>It belonged to a skinny man with a buzz cut and sunken features.</p>, <p>\".....Is that so?\"</p>, <p>Kiera smiled as she neared one of the prison cells where the inmate appeared. Holding onto the bars, he brought his face closer.</p>, <p>\"What do you say? I'm not bad, right?\"</p>, <p>\"I wonder.\"</p>, <p>Brushing her hair behind her ear, she leaned forward a little.</p>, <p>\"I'm curious about something though.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh?\"</p>, <p>The inmate looked down slightly.</p>, <p>\"Ask away. I'll tell you anything. Hehehe.\"</p>, <p>\"How sweet of you~\"</p>, <p>The current Kiera seemed like a stark contrast to how she usually was. Normally, she would've insulted them back or thrown a middle finger, but such wasn't the case at the moment.</p>, <p>\"So, I was just curious... You are like the small dogs here, aren't you?\"</p>, <p>\"Small dogs?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah, you know. The low-risk guys.\"</p>, <p>The prisoners were separated into three ranks. They were ranked depending on the severity of the crimes committed, and their general strength; Extreme-risk, High-risk, and Low-</p>, <p>risk.</p>, <p>\"....Where are the really scary guys locked up?\"</p>, <p>The face of the prisoner changed at the inquiry. No longer did he seem as keen to talk to her as he was before.</p>, <p>\"Why are you asking about them?\"</p>, <p>He almost seemed wary.</p>, <p>Kiera could even sense some lingering fear in his tone.</p>, <p>'As expected, he might know something...'</p>, <p>She hadn't selected him for no reason. Having talked with the other inmates, she more or less came to learn about the general hierarchy within the prison.</p>, <p>The inmate before her was an 'informant'. He was someone who knew a lot, and the exact person that Kiera was looking for.</p>, <p>\"Dunno, I'm just curious. Heard a lot of stories about them before coming here.\"</p>, <p>\".....I see.\"</p>, <p>He seemed to have bought that, but...</p>, <p>\"Sorry, can't talk.\"</p>, <p>\"You can't...?\"</p>, <p>\"Well...\"</p>, <p>He glanced at her, the meaning of his gaze clear.</p>, <p>Kiera smiled and looked around her. Then, making sure nobody was looking, her hand flashed forward and reached for the inmate's shirt before she thrust it back and pulled him along.</p>, <p>\"Hey, wa...!\"</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>A loud banging sound echoed. Several gazes fell on her the moment the sound echoed, and she returned them with a glare.</p>, <p>\"What are you looking at?\"</p>, <p>Only then did they look away and she returned her gaze to the inmate. She discussed it with the other guards, and so long as she had a proper reason, she could use some 'force' against the inmates.</p>, <p>So long as it wasn't excessive...</p>, <p>\"Ukh... You!? What are you....!\"</p>, <p>Her head reached into the cell again and she once again pulled.</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>\"Akh...!\"</p>, <p>Drip... Drip!</p>, <p>Blood started to drip down from the inmate's nose as he looked up to Kiera.</p>, <p>\"Wh!\"</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>He was never able to get a word out as each time she'd trust his head towards the bars.</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>It went on for several times before his expression contained nothing else but fear.</p>, <p>\"Huu... Hu..... Y-you...\"</p>, <p>Her cold gaze bore down on him as she looked at him from above.</p>, <p>\".....Looking at me doesn't come cheap, you know? Time for me to collect my payment.\"</p>]\n",

There was nothing out of the ordinary.</p>, <p>He was taking his job seriously.</p>, <p>Although he technically didn't have to be here considering that he already had a job, he chose to participate. Mainly because his 'instincts' told him that something was going to happen here.</p>, <p>What exactly, he wasn't sure.</p>, <p>That was why he was looking around and taking note of everything.</p>, <p>It was so that he could detect the abnormality and stop it before it was too late.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing?\"</p>, <p>As he walked, a figure suddenly walked up to him.

The Professor said that it doesn't really matter.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>If that was the case...</p>, <p>He took out a pen and started to scribble a few things. A dumbfounded Aoife looked at him with wider eyes.</p>, <p>\"You've already got complaints?\"</p>, <p>\"Several.\"</p>, <p>The prison was generally well run, but there were still things that it could improve on. Having observed for over the past few hours, he had already made a short list in his mind.</p>, <p>\"Overcrowded. The place has far too many inmates. There are over five inmates per cell. A situation like this is bound to create problems in the future. The nutrition is also not up to par with the meal composition missing a lot of fiber and protein. Ideally, it would be best if...\"</p>, <p>He didn't shy away and started to write all the complaints he had.</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>He was suddenly distracted by a loud banging sound. When he raised his head, he saw Aoife looking in the same direction as where the noise came from.</p>, <p>He followed her gaze.</p>, <p>\"....Ah.\"</p>, <p>There, in the far distance, they spotted Kiera glaring around at everyone who was looking in her direction. The two of them weren't spared from her glare as she had a gaze that seemed to say, 'What? Mind your fucking business.'</p>, <p>\"Crazy bitch.\"</p>, <p> Aoife muttered in a voice audible enough for Leon to hear.</p>, <p>Leon was taken aback.</p>, <p>'Did I hear, right...?'</p>, <p>The usually quite and refined Aoife swore?</p>, <p>\".....You don't like her?\"</p>, <p>For quite a while, Leon noticed a strange tension between the Aoife and Kiera. Sparks flew whenever the two interacted with each other.</p>, <p>\"I don't.\"</p>, <p>Aoife's words served to confirm this.</p>, <p>Leon was curious but decided to keep his curiosity to himself. It was none of this business, and he wasn't sure if his inquiry would annoy her.</p>, <p>But much to his surprise, it was her who elaborated...</p>, <p>\"Do you know what the first thing she did to me when we met?\"</p>, <p>\".....No.\"</p>, <p>How would he know?</p>, <p>Aoife massaged her temples. From the frown on her face, it appeared that the memory was a rather unpleasant one.</p>, <p>\"She told me to fuck off and threw a middle finger at me.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>That sounded oddly a lot like something Kiera would do...</p>, <p>\"So if you ask me whether I like her, the answer is no. I don't like her. She's crazy.\"</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Leon found himself unable to refute her words. Staring into the distance, and seeing her beat up one of the inmates into a bloody pulp, he could only shake his head and ignore the commotion.</p>, <p>It wasn't his job to stop her.</p>, <p>He was about to go back to his job when his chest suddenly tightened.</p>, <p>\"....Um?\"</p>, <p>A familiar sensation washed over him, prompting his gaze to drift slowly towards the distance where a solitary cell came into view. His eyes settled on an inmate seated calmly in a chair, absorbed in reading a newspaper.</p>, <p>With his legs crossed, and his calm poise, there seemed to be nothing strange about him, and yet...</p>, <p>\".....Why.\"</p>, <p>Why were his instincts telling him that something was wrong?</p>, <p>All of a sudden, as if sensing the gaze, the inmate put the newspaper down and looked up.</p>, <p>Their gazes met, and Leon felt the hair at the back of his neck stand.</p>, <p>'This...'</p>, <p>Who was this guy?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The residential hall was rather large. It took me several hours to walk the place, and even then, I couldn't find who I was looking for.</p>, <p>\"….Is he not here?\"</p>, <p>I was told that he had been imprisoned here. Furthermore, the vision also said something along the lines of a former Haven Professor being one of the few people to have escaped.</p>, <p>Was it perhaps not him and some other professor…?</p>, <p>\"Or is he locked up somewhere else?\"</p>, <p>I found myself frowning at the situation. It wasn't supposed to be like this.</p>, <p>\"…..Just where—\"</p>, <p>I stopped mid-sentence and turned to look back.</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>It was there that I finally spotted him. I peered beyond the large window at the end of the hallway, toward the outdoor area. A figure sat with their back turned, their hands moving in a familiar manner.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>Even though I couldn't hear from my vantage point, observing his movements and posture sparked my imagination as I heard the sound of the pieces falling against the board, and I found myself involuntarily smiling.</p>, <p>Even now…</p>, <p>He hadn't changed.</p>, <p>I stepped out of the residential area and onto the outdoor area.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>The nearer I got, the more pronounced the sound became. It was a sound that I hadn't heard in quite a while and felt rather nostalgic.</p>, <p>I eventually stopped a few meters away from him and asked,</p>, <p>\"….Can I play?\"</p>, <p>Surprised, Professor Bucklam turned his head and our eyes met.</p>, <p>It was at that moment that I finally found the answer to one of the questions I had been dying to know.</p>, <p>\"You remember, don't you?\"</p>, <p>He sat there, his face frozen in what seemed to be shock and surprise.</p>, <p>I sat down on the opposite end.</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>And started to fix the board.</p>, <p>\"I haven't played since then, but I'm still confident in my ability to beat you.\"</p>, <p>Even as I said those words, he didn't react. At least not immediately.</p>, <p>Eventually, he let out a soft smile and mumbled in a quiet tone,</p>, <p>\"….So it wasn't a dream.\"</p>, <p>\"What was?\"</p>, <p>I already knew what he was referring to, but I still chose to pretend like I didn't know.</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>\"Let's get started. I'll make this a quick one.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah…\"</p>, <p>With a soft sigh, he shook his head and reached his hand forward.</p>, <p>\"You've gotten very bold after beating me once. Things won't be as easy as last time.\"</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>He went on to move his piece.</p>, <p>\"Your habits are the same.\"</p>, <p>Tak. \"So are yours.\"</p>, <p>\"What makes you think I'm not doing it on purpose?\"</p>, <p>\"Same goes for me.\"</p>, <p>We went on to bicker like that for the next few minutes. Eventually, the area around us became quiet.</p>, <p>Strangely, the silence didn't feel at all uncomfortable as we both focused on the game.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>Though it had been a while, I still remembered how to play, and was able to keep up with his moves. Just barely...</p>, <p>This went on for the next few minutes until I eventually broke the silence.</p>, <p>\"Are you planning on escaping?\"</p>, <p>His hand froze halfway and his head flicked up. He looked at me with a look of genuine confusion.</p>, <p>I didn't lift my head and continued to stare at the board.</p>, <p>Judging from his reaction, it was clear that he knew something.</p>, <p>\"I won't stop you.\"</p>, <p>That was the decision I had come up with for myself.</p>, <p>\"You can escape. I won't do anything.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I couldn't quite tell what reaction he was making since I wasn't paying attention to him, but I was sure it was filled with surprise.</p>, <p>For the past week, I had been debating over the situation in my mind.</p>, <p>I was still uncertain of the goal of the mission, however, from what I knew, it was something related to the second calamity.</p>, <p>Things would surely become clearer to me with time.</p>, <p>However, if possible, I wanted to let him go. Of course, it wasn't because I felt pity for the Professor. I did to some extent, but not to the point where I'd help him escape the place.</p>, <p>.....I just needed someone on my side.</p>, <p>\"I can more or less tell why you did the things that you did. You were either promised a cure for your memory problems or threatened with your family...\"</p>, <p>Which one it was, I wasn't sure.</p>, <p>However, when I lifted my gaze to observe his reaction and saw his eyes quivering, I knew that I was right.</p>, <p>I continued.</p>, <p>\"It would be unfair for me to stop you. I know exactly how it feels to lose someone important to you.\"</p>, <p>Just slightly, my voice layered.</p>, <p>The Professor's expression cracked and his arms started to tremble.</p>, <p>I reached to hold it.</p>, <p>\"You must resent the people who did this to you, right?\"</p>, <p>The mana inside of my body started to drain. I kept my face composed and continued to make contact with him.</p>, <p>I felt a little disgusted with myself. Using my powers to manipulate his weakness, but... it had to be done.</p>, <p>For the sake of my goal.</p>, <p>I had to do it.</p>, <p>His expression started to distort and his fists started to clench. A fit of visible anger.</p>, <p>I continued.</p>, <p>\".....That's why I won't stop you. If possible, I want to help you.\"</p>, <p>What was my end goal in all of this...?</p>, <p>I realized quite a while ago that the organization that I was dealing with was a lot more dangerous than I thought.</p>, <p>Even now, I was clueless about the extent of their powers, and given how they had managed to manipulate a professor and succeed in getting five inmates out of one of the top prisons in this world, I knew they were powerful.</p>, <p>For this reason, I needed allies.</p>, <p>People who could help me from the inside.</p>, <p>Having seen all his memories, I knew exactly what type of person he was. What he cared about the most, and how desperate his situation was.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I believed he would make for the right person to use.</p>, <p>I squeezed his hand and my mana drained further.</p>, <p>I instilled even more anger within him.</p>, <p>\"I'm sure you have some resentment against the people that did this to you. That forced you to do things that went against your morals. I fully understand where you're coming from, and that's why I want to help you.\"</p>, <p>Finally, I let go of his hand and he lifted his gaze to meet my eyes.</p>, <p>I smiled.</p>, <p>\"Let's help each other.\"</p>, <p>Please...</p>, <p>\"Tell me everything that you know about the situation. In return, I'll offer you my help in taking revenge.\"</p>, <p>Join me.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"Akh…! G-get away from me…!\"</p>, <p>\"That's enough!\"</p>, <p>\"Stop struggling...!\"</p>, <p>Kiera was eventually stopped by the stationed guards who held her back from both sides.</p>, <p>\"I'm not done yet…! Let go of me. I still haven't beaten him enough!\"</p>, <p>However, she didn't seem satisfied enough as her body continued to trash.</p>, <p>\"Hold her back!\"</p>, <p>\"Akh!\"</p>, <p>\"Let go...!\"</p>, <p>Despite her protests, the guards didn't let go of her and eventually pulled her back from the inmate.</p>, <p>Only then did Kiera finally calm down as she looked around with heavy breaths.</p>, <p>\"Im-Haa…. Haa… fine… I'm calm… haaa…\"</p>, <p>The guards looked at each other for a brief moment before finally letting go of her.</p>, <p>\"Cadet. I understand you aren't very pleased with their words, but please hold some restraint. There's a limit to how much you can retaliate.\"</p>, <p>\"Haaa… yes, yes…\"</p>, <p>At a glance, it didn't seem as though she had gotten the message and the two guards looked at each other with bitter looks. In the end, warning her several more times, they finally left.</p>, <p>Kiera waited until they were completely gone before going on patrol again. This time, she could feel more eyes on her, all on high alert. They were clearly worried about the idea of her going on another rampage.</p>, <p>However, much to their surprise, she remained tame.</p>, <p>Perhaps it was because the jeers had gotten quieter due to her sudden outburst, or that she had taken the warnings to heart, she didn't lash out and diligently did her job.</p>, <p>This went on for several hours.</p>, <p>\"….It's time.\"</p>, <p>It was only when she could no longer feel the gazes on her that she made her move.</p>, <p>Glancing around, she left her post.</p>, <p>The residential area was split into four different areas; North, South, West, and East.</p>, <p>Her current objective was the Northern area.</p>, <p>According to what she'd heard, that was where she needed to be.</p>, <p>She silently pretended to patrol while moving toward the direction she wanted to be.</p>, <p>Her steps eventually stopped in front of a small door. There was no one guarding the place and for a very good reason at that.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>It needed a certain key to unlock.</p>, <p>One that Kiera managed to get from one of the guards who had reprimanded her just a few hours ago. Although a small part of her did indeed want to beat the inmate up for the way he looked at her, her true objective had been the key from the very start.</p>, <p>\"Huuuu…\"</p>, <p>Kiera took a deep breath. Finally, she was about to meet her. She hasn't come to this place just for credits.</p>, <p>There was something, someone, that she really needed to visit.</p>, <p>A person whom she held quite dearly, but at the same time despised.</p>, <p> Creaaaak…</p>, <p>The door opened and she stepped in.</p>, <p>Kiera was immediately greeted by a deafening silence and a long corridor. A stark contrast to the chaos that engulfed the main residential area.</p>, <p>\"….\"</p>, <p>There were hardly any guards around. She could see why. The cells were fully enclosed, leaving little room for observation except for small holes at the bottom and top.</p>, <p>But even that…</p>, <p>Wasn't where she wanted to be. She needed to go further. Deeper into the corridor. At the far end where she'd see what she came in for.</p>, <p>And so she did.</p>, <p>To Tak—</p>, <p>Her steps quietly resounded throughout the long corridor, their gentle rhythm quietly echoing in her mind as she continued forward.</p>, <p>She had to be careful.</p>, <p>There were guards stationed somewhere around. She didn't know exactly where they were, and how powerful they were, but they were here. Hiding somewhere and fully alert for any possible intrusion.</p>, <p>But that didn't matter to Kiera.</p>, <p>Her eyes flashed and her figure started to blend with the darkness. Gradually, her figure disappeared.</p>, <p>There were sensors set up around the perimeter. However, they were all meaningless. With the key on her body, the sensors had a hard time keeping track of her.</p>, <p>On the other hand, the guards that were present hardly felt her presence.</p>, <p>It wasn't because they were weak.</p>, <p>Most of them were stronger than her, but her mastery over the [Darkness] attribute was not something that they could detect. Only the truly strong guards would be able to detect her presence, but she was sure they weren't present at the moment.</p>, <p>At least, not to where she was headed.</p>, <p>Her steps eventually stopped. A large cell appeared in front of her.</p>, <p>She peered through the gap where she saw a figure slumped by the side of the wall. With her head lowered, her long blonde hair covered her face.</p>, <p>Clenching her teeth, Kiera called out.</p>, <p>\"Maste-No, Rose.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>The head raised to reveal two gleaming red eyes. They blinked slowly, trying to make sense of where the voice came from before finally catching a glimpse of Kiera who stood on the other side.</p>, <p>Immediately, a smile flashed across her features.</p>, <p>\"Oh my, if it isn't little Kiera?\"</p>, <p>Her head tilted to the side as she peered through the gap to meet Kiera's gaze. There were hints of amusement in her expression as she looked at her.</p>, <p>\"You've grown into quite the splendid woman since the last time I saw you.\"</p>, <p>All Kiera felt was disgust upon hearing the woman's voice.</p>, <p>It wasn't just her voice that disgusted her.</p>, <p>Her appearance, her poise, her hair, everything about her disgusted her…</p>, <p>\".....You know why I'm here. Spit it out. Tell me why you did it.\"</p>, <p>\"Did it...?\"</p>, <p>She pretended to fall into thought before eventually knocking the side of her head.</p>, <p>\"Sorry, I really don't know what you're talking about~ Can you clarify a little?\"</p>, <p>Kiera's fist clenched tightly. She was the same as she had been in the past. Easygoing and bubbly. Never taking anything seriously.</p>, <p>There was a time when Kiera used to like her for her personality.</p>, <p>However, now...</p>, <p>\"You disgust me.\"</p>, <p>All she could feel was disgust and loathing.</p>, <p>\"You think this is some sort of joke...? Is everything to you a joke? Was the death of my mother, your sister a joke?\"</p>, <p>Kiera venomously spat every word as she glared at the figure ahead.</p>, <p>Indeed, the woman before her was her aunt. Her master, and someone whom she had once regarded as the closest person in her life.</p>, <p>She was also the very same person that killed her mother.</p>, <p>Her very own blood sister.</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>It was all Kiera could ask.</p>, <p>\"Why did you do it...?\"</p>, <p>She wanted answers. She was desperate for answers.</p>, <p>But....</p>, <p>\"Hmm, who knows~\"</p>, <p>All she received was the same nonchalant attitude of hers.</p>, <p>It...</p>, <p>Pissed her off.</p>, <p>Right then and there, she almost banged on the door ahead. If not for the fact that she was worried she'd attract the attention of the guards behind her, she would've smashed it with everything she had.</p>, <p>Rose's mana was currently sealed. She was weaker than she was.</p>, <p>All it would take would be a simple spell to end her, and yet...</p>, <p>\"Kh.\"</p>, <p>The only thing Kiera could do was glare at her from where she was.</p>, <p>\"What a cute expression.\"</p>, <p>Rose licked her lips and finally moved her body, nearing the narrow gap that enabled the two of them to see each other.</p>, <p>Kiera stood still and watched as she approached.</p>, <p>Eventually, Rose stopped and Kiera got a good look at her face. It was no longer as pretty as it once was. With sunken cheeks and hollow eyes, it was clear that her time here hadn't been good. It made her feel a little better.</p>, <p>'If only her face wasn't so detestable...'</p>, <p>Kiera could hardly stand the sight of her.</p>, <p>\".....You've grown up so much.\"</p>, <p>Frowning, Kiera was about to rebuke when she continued.</p>, <p>\"You've gotten prettier and stronger than the last time that I've seen you. I'm proud of what you've managed to achieve, but...\"</p>, <p>With a look of disappointment, she suddenly smiled.</p>, <p>\"You're still as naive as ever.\"</p>, <p>\"What non—\"</p>, <p>\"Did you truly think you could've made it here with the level of your skill?\"</p>, <p>Kiera found herself losing her breath and her expression stiffened.</p>, <p>\"You've always been quite talented with the [Darkness] attributed, but that wouldn't be enough to get here. Most of the guards here are about your strength, if not a little stronger, but...\"</p>, <p>Rose suddenly brought her face closer.</p>, <p>\"Do you really think they wouldn't be able to have means to detect you? Hehehe.\"</p>, <p>With a sudden laugh, Rose's gaze shifted away from Kiera who stood petrified as she felt the presence of a figure behind her.</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>A single footstep reverberated through the silent hall.</p>, <p>Kiera felt her heartbeat quicken all of a sudden. A sense of crisis gripped her heart.</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>Another one followed shortly after.</p>, <p>It seemed to be approaching their direction. Her gaze naturally fell on her master who stared ahead with a smile.</p>, <p>Her stomach dropped and she got into a stance.</p>, <p>Whatever was coming, she was ready to put up a fight.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"....Uh?\"</p>, <p>Kiera's eyes widened at the sight of the figure that appeared.</p>, <p>Tall frame, curly black hair, deep hazel eyes, and a face that one wouldn't forget even if they wanted to. He appeared right before her, his cold gaze bearing down on her as his steps came to a halt.</p>, <p>Dazed, Kiera looked at him.</p>, <p>\"…You.\"</p>, <p>She was stunned.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing here?\"</p>, <p>And alarmed.</p>, <p>How could he be here? She had made sure to close the door the moment she had entered. It was therefore impossible for her to think he had followed her.</p>, <p>There must've been another reason for his appearance.</p>, <p>Kiera's head turned and the expression her aunt wore deeply etched itself in her mind.</p>, <p>\"Yo-\"</p>, <p>And just before she could say anything, she caught a glimpse of a thin thread heading for the narrow gap of the cell.</p>, <p>As Kiera's eyes traced over the thread that headed for the cell, her eyes widened all of a sudden as she hastily turned her head to stare at her aunt whose face suddenly changed.</p>, <p>\"You, wait, what are—\"</p>, <p>The last thing Kiera caught was the frozen expression of her aunt as her neck severed off cleanly from her body.</p>, <p>Pfttt—</p>, <p>Blood splurted all over, some of it making its way toward Kiera who stood frozen on the spot.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>The head fell and silence gripped the surroundings.</p>, <p>Only for it to be broken by a sudden blaring sound.</p>, <p>Wooooooooooooo—!</p>, <p>The prison alarm.</p>, <p>It had rang.</p>]\n",

The look on his face… it was as if he was seeing something interesting.</p>, <p>Leon didn't reply and looked around the cell. It was spotless. Everything was in order, and there didn't seem to be anything strange about the place.</p>, <p>And yet…</p>, <p>'Something's wrong.'</p>, <p>His instincts warned him of something.</p>, <p>He paced around the room, lifting the pillows, the mattress, and the furniture as he searched.</p>, <p>However, regardless of what he did, he found nothing.

In that moment, a sense of foreboding washed over him, and he thrust his fist forward.</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>The surroundings shook as he felt his fist collide with another.</p>, <p>\"….!\"</p>, <p>At that moment Leon finally understood what was wrong, and his expression cracked.</p>, <p>\"You… Your mana isn't restrained.\"</p>, <p>His words were met with a smirk.</p>, <p>\"It's too late.\"</p>, <p>Thump! Thump!</p>, <p>Muffled sounds echoed in the distance all of a sudden, and before Leon could react, the alarms blared to life.</p>, <p>Woooooo—!</p>, <p>Clank! Clank! Clank!</p>, <p>What followed after was a loud metallic sound and the sound of the inmate's voices.</p>, <p>\"Hahaha! What's this? Why are my cuffs suddenly off?\"</p>, <p>\"I can feel my body again…?!\"</p>, <p>\"My restraints are gone!\"</p>, <p> Leon's eyes widened all of a sudden and his head lowered to stare at the inmate.</p>, <p>\"You…\"</p>, <p>The inmate smirked.</p>, <p>\"It's too late.

I hadn't expected her to be here, but considering a little obstruction on the way, I understood how she had made it here.</p>, <p>The guards around the place had their senses restrained, making it extremely easy to move around. Even if I were to shout right now, the guards wouldn't notice.</p>, <p>It was a chilling thought.</p>, <p>Just what sort of organization was capable of such a feat?</p>, <p>However, I didn't dwell on this for long as my gaze fell on Kiera.</p>, <p>'She's the second calamity…'</p>, <p>It became clear to me at this moment.</p>, <p>'Then, that would mean Aoife was the first calamity.'</p>, <p>Two pieces of the long puzzle finally stuck into place.</p>, <p>\"Ah, this… fuck…what have you…\"</p>, <p>A certain stutter broke my thoughts.

So you knew…?\"</p>, <p>I turned back and immediately raised my left hand.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>Sparks flew as I felt the tip of a long blade touch the tip of my nose.</p>, <p>\"Chains…?\"</p>, <p>With a look of surprise, her red eyes widened slightly as she voiced her surprise.</p>, <p>\".....Is that your weapon, or a spell?\"</p>, <p>I didn't say anything and distanced myself a little.</p>, <p>Cra… Crack—!</p>, <p>A subtle cracking sound emanated from the chains wrapped around my arm. The mana within my body drained, and they slowly began to repair themselves.</p>, <p>Indeed, this was the method I had come up with to use my new spell [Chains of Alakantria].</p>, <p>My greatest weakness was my defense. I pondered long and hard on how to compensate for it, and this was the result.</p>, <p>Clank, clank—!</p>, <p>The chains moved, wrapping over my left fist as I slowly clenched it.</p>, <p>I turned my head to look at Kiera who was still in a daze.</p>, <p>\"....Get your act together. She's currently weakened.\"</p>, <p>Having had her mana sealed for so long, her current strength was a far cry from what it usually was.</p>, <p>There was no better time than to deal with her now.</p>, <p>Especially for someone who had been locked here. I didn't know the extent of her strength, but she was certainly powerful. A lot more powerful than the two of us combined.</p>, <p>\"The more time we waste, the more things are advantageous for her.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, shit, fuck…\"</p>, <p>Only then did Kiera snap out of her daze.</p>, <p>She went on to ruffle her hair.</p>, <p>\"Fuck.\"</p>, <p>Her face was filled with doubt, but considering the situation, she put those thoughts aside and raised her hand where a red magic circle appeared.</p>, <p>\"Try to buy me time.\"</p>, <p>She fell silent thereafter, but I sensed a tremendous surge of mana emanating from her. It became clear to me that she was preparing for a large spell.</p>, <p>\"Oh my~\"</p>, <p>The woman massaged her bruised wrist.</p>, <p>\"That's quite a powerful spell that you're preparing Ki. How about you go easier on me? I'm not in the best of shapes.\"</p>, <p>Even now she didn't seem to take the situation seriously.</p>, <p>It wasn't as though I didn't understand. To her, we probably looked like amateurs. Still, her talk was meaningless.</p>, <p>\"Her trait is [Body], and she specializes in the sword. Be careful in short-range combat. Keep a certain distance.\"</p>, <p>Kiera's voice reached me from behind.</p>, <p>The mana around her surged further.</p>, <p>\"….I can try.\"</p>, <p>There was no guarantee. I could see that with each second that passed, her strength was increasing.</p>, <p>I didn't have much time.</p>, <p>I quickly channeled my mana and pointed forward.</p>, <p>[Hands of Malady].</p>, <p>Hands sprouted from the area beneath her.</p>, <p>Swoosh—! I somewhat anticipated her to dodge and had strategically placed several threads around to impede her movement. However, it proved futile as she deftly maneuvered around the threads.</p>, <p>'Fuck!'</p>, <p>She appeared in front of me, her fist already near my face.</p>, <p>I once again raised my left hand to block the incoming attack, but…</p>, <p>Booom!</p>, <p>\"Ukeh….!\"</p>, <p>She altered the course of the fist mid-motion and directly hit me in the stomach.</p>, <p>I almost had the urge to puke as I took several steps back and glanced at Kiera who looked at me with a look that seemed to say 'The fuck are you doing?'</p>, <p>This…</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Ducking down to evade an incoming sword, I thrust my hand forward. A magic circle formed, and five purple threads burst out, hurtling directly toward her.</p>, <p>The distance between us was very close, and I was confident that I'd at least graze her, but…</p>, <p>Swoosh—! Swoosh—! As if she had eyes at the back of her head, she moved around and dodged everything.</p>, <p>\"...This is bullshit.\"</p>, <p>Her instincts and reaction time were no joke. And to add insult to injury, she was getting stronger and faster with each second.</p>, <p>\"You i-idiot... She can sense the mana trace from whatever that shit is.\"</p>, <p>Hearing Kiera's scolding, I felt my brows twitch. I wanted to tell her to switch roles with me, but considering that I didn't have a final move like she did, I could only grunt at her.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>The distance between us shrank.</p>, <p>I stared ahead and forced myself to remain calm.</p>, <p>This was clearly not working. I needed a new way.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Her blade thrust my way. The speed at which it was moving was extremely fast.</p>, <p>'Since she can sense my mana trace...'</p>, <p>I gritted my teeth and recalled everything. The chains, and the threads.</p>, <p>It all occurred in less than a second, and at that moment, I sidestepped and brought both my hands diagonally.</p>, <p>Sweat dripped down the side of my face as the blade neared.</p>, <p>It was only a few inches away.</p>, <p>....I could see it near my eyes.</p>, <p>Almost...</p>, <p>\"Now!\"</p>, <p>A translucent purple chain materialized on both my hands and I pushed to my left.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>Sparks flew and something grazed my check.</p>, <p>I was pushed back several meters.</p>, <p>\"Ukh…\"</p>, <p>Feeling a sweet sensation at the back of my throat, I let out a groan.</p>, <p>It was obvious that she had come out on top in the exchange and that I had clearly lost.</p>, <p>However…</p>, <p>\"...I did it.\"</p>, <p>I looked at the chains in my hand. Squeezing my hand, they shattered and I stared ahead where the woman was. She seemed surprised by the fact that I had managed to block her attack.</p>, <p>\"Yo—\"</p>, <p>I didn't let her talk. The more she talked and wasted time, the stronger she became.</p>, <p>I was quick to move and swung my hand in her direction.</p>, <p>Clank. Clank.</p>, <p>Simultaneously, chains materialized in the midst of the motion, prompting her to dodge backward.</p>, <p>\"....Uh.\"</p>, <p>The chains shattered before they could hit the ground.</p>, <p>In the meantime, I twisted my torso and swung horizontally using my left hand.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Once again, the chains materialized mid-motion, further complicating her ability to gauge the distance and sense the mana trace.</p>, <p>Once again, she was able to dodge the attack.</p>, <p>I wasn't disheartened.</p>, <p>In fact… I felt nothing but excitement.</p>, <p>\"This…\"</p>, <p>It was working.</p>, <p>I had found something new.</p>, <p>As the mana rapidly drained and my breath grew heavy, I found myself becoming more accustomed to this new fighting style. Despite the strain, I grew more adept at manipulating the chains, shattering and reappearing around my hands.</p>, <p>Call.</p>, <p>Recall.</p>, <p>Call.</p>, <p>Recall.</p>, <p>There was a lag between each set of actions, but it was becoming smoother by the second.</p>, <p>Finally, the distance was starting to create between us. Unlike before, it was starting to become harder for her to dodge. Even as her strength increased, so did my proficiency.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>I swung my hand again. She reacted before the chains appeared, ducking down, but…</p>, <p>\"Heh.\"</p>, <p>I smiled and swung my other hand. It was a fake.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>\"Ukh!\"</p>, <p>Finally, I made contact with her, and sparks flew through the air as the chains connected with her sword.</p>, <p>I wanted to celebrate but found myself unable to.</p>, <p>\"Haaaa… Haaa…\"</p>, <p>I was heavily out of breath, and my mind was starting to become blurry. It was clear to me that I was running out of juice.</p>, <p>I looked behind to stare at Kiera.</p>, <p>\"How long…?\"</p>, <p>She didn't respond, instead staring at her hands where an impressive magic circle appeared. Even from where I stood, I could feel the formidable power emanating from it.</p>, <p>That, however, proved to be a mistake as something flashed next to me.</p>, <p>It was headed straight for Kiera.</p>, <p>\"Shit…!\"</p>, <p>Reacting purely on instinct, I extended my right hand, conjuring five threads that swiftly enveloped the entire surrounding area.</p>, <p>\"Ukeh…!\"</p>, <p>A low grunt sounded as the threads snapped and I was pushed back. However, I just barely managed to halt whatever was attempting to pass me.</p>, <p>\"Move…!\"</p>, <p>I didn't even have time to catch my breath before I heard Keira's shout. Instinctively, I leaped to the side.</p>, <p>I was glad I did.</p>, <p>Woooom—!</p>, <p>A powerful flame surged forward, engulfing the entire corridor. A bright light covered everything as I felt the intense heat pressing against my back.</p>, <p>\"…\"</p>, <p>The pain was tolerable.</p>, <p>It burned my entire back and legs, but it was manageable. I had been through worse.</p>, <p>The flames continued to surge forward, persisting for several more seconds before finally dissipating.</p>, <p>\"Ah….\"</p>, <p>I raised my head after a few seconds.</p>, <p>\"That.\"</p>, <p>It was powerful.</p>, <p>Really powerful.</p>, <p>Would I have survived if I hadn't dodged in time? I was doubting my chances.</p>, <p>\"…..\"</p>, <p>The corridor was empty and a strange silence gripped our surroundings.</p>, <p>\"Did we do it…?\"</p>, <p>I heard Kiera's voice from behind. It sounded tired and haggard.</p>, <p>I pursed my lips.</p>, <p>\"…..I don't know.\"</p>, <p>I released a long breath and sat up, resting my arm over my knee. Calmly, I surveyed the corridor before muttering once more.</p>, <p>\"I don't know.\"</p>]\n",

I remained seated and stared in the distance.</p>, <p>\"....I'm tired.\"</p>, <p>I could hardly move my body.</p>, <p>Out there, on the opposite side, the guards were probably fighting against the inmates who had escaped.</p>, <p>I knew the plan from Professor Bucklam who had told me everything. At least, everything that he knew.</p>, <p>Five other people were aware of the plan. They all seemed to belong to the same organization.</p>, <p>....The one that I also seemed to be a part of.</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>I snapped out of my thoughts after hearing a certain voice. However, I didn't turn my head and continued to stare in the same direction.</p>, <p>\"....How come you're here?\"</p>, <p>In the end, that was all she managed to say.</p>, <p>I almost laughed then.</p>, <p>\"I'd like to ask you the same question.\"</p>, <p>No, really.</p>, <p>I was actually curious.</p>, <p>\"That's none of your-\"</p>, <p>She stopped upon realizing her own hypocrisy. Her expression crumbled, and she eventually clicked her tongue.</p>, <p>\"My aunt. That was my aunt.\"</p>, <p>\"....I see.\"</p>, <p>It finally made more sense to me.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"....So?\"</p>, <p>\"So, what?\"</p>, <p>I turned to look at Kiera who had her mouth open. As if realizing something, she ended up muttering something along the lines of, 'Would you believe this fucker...'</p>, <p>I could only hear because she wasn't trying to hide her voice.</p>, <p>\"I only said, 'I'd like to ask you the same question'. Didn't mean that I was planning on sharing after you shared.\"</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>She raised her fist and leaned her body slightly. It looked like she wanted to hit me. However, I didn't flinch and just stared at her.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing?\"</p>, <p>Her red eyes sparkled in the dark as she clenched her teeth.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>That fist never reached me.</p>, <p> With a long breath, she leaned back and cursed.</p>, <p>\"Fuck.\"</p>, <p>I silently shook my head and similarly leaned back. My body still ached, and my mana was recovering very slowly.</p>, <p>In the distance, I could still hear the muffled banging sounds. It seemed pretty intense out there.</p>, <p>\".....You're pretty strong.\"</p>, <p>My thoughts were once again broken by Kiera's voice.</p>, <p>\"Strong?\"</p>, <p>I looked at her and almost doubted her words.</p>, <p>Did she really just call me strong...?</p>, <p>I wanted to laugh. Strong? As if. I was currently still weak.</p>, <p>The only reason I was even able to keep up with her aunt was because her mana had been sealed for so long that her body was still getting accustomed to life without restraints.</p>, <p>I would've been killed with a flick of her finger had that not been the case.</p>, <p>Still...</p>, <p>\"....Thanks.\"</p>, <p>I received her words and didn't deny them.</p>, <p>Such was my persona.</p>, <p>\"Not a trace of humility, huh...? Well, I get it. Annoying as you are, you are pretty strong.\"</p>, <p>Kiera ended up shrugging her shoulders.</p>, <p>\"So yeah...\"</p>, <p>She proceeded to scratch the side of her face.</p>, <p>\"....Uh, yeah.\"</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>\"Yup.\"</p>, <p>Scratch—</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Repeating the same words, she struggled to get the words out of her mouth. Confused, I continued to stare at her when she ended up clicking her tongue.</p>, <p>\"Whatever, fuck. I just wanted to say thanks.\"</p>, <p>\"Thanks...?\"</p>, <p>I was taken aback.</p>, <p>This was the last thing I had expected her to say.</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>\"Killing that bit-my aunt...Thanks for helping me.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Even as she clarified, I had a hard time getting the words out of me. I thought I had gotten an understanding of her character, but...</p>, <p>Just what sort of situation was this?</p>, <p>Suddenly thanking me out of nowhere... I honestly never expected it.</p>, <p>'Maybe, she's the type that's really upfront about her feelings.'</p>, <p>The type that said what they thought. It made sense when I thought about it. However, I hardly knew her well enough to be sure.</p>, <p>I was just about to say something when Kiera's face scrunched up and she rubbed both sides of her arms.</p>, <p>\"Ah, shit... You're making me cringe at my own comments. Ugh, fuck. Goosebumps. All I feel are goosebumps.\"</p>, <p>With the help of the wall, she proceeded to stand up.</p>, <p>\"Whatever, I'm fucking leaving.\"</p>, <p>Without looking back, her steps echoed throughout. The entire way, she continued to run her arms while muttering 'goosebumps' over and over again.</p>, <p>As her back gradually shrank from my view, I managed to hear a few more words from her.</p>, <p>\"Where's my cigarette when I need it? Shit.\"</p>, <p>I saw her smack her own head.</p>, <p>\"That was so fucking cringe. Ugh-!\"</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>I stared at the scene and unknowingly found myself smirking.</p>, <p>It was funny.</p>, <p>And in a way... It was cute as well.</p>, <p>She was certainly a unique character.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I shifted my gaze to look up at the ceiling and gradually, I lost my smile. Would she really be thanking me if she knew the truth?</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.</p>, <p>Her aunt... The person that she wanted to kill.</p>, <p>She was still alive and kicking. I knew this because I was the one who helped her escape.</p>, <p>\"What a sick twist.\"</p>, <p>.....The fact that she was her aunt was a sick twist I hadn't expected.</p>, <p>Had I known, then...</p>, <p>\"Heh.\"</p>, <p>I suddenly laughed as realization hit me.</p>, <p>\"....I'd probably have done the same thing.\"</p>, <p>Of that, I was sure.</p>, <p>In the end, this was a necessary step that I needed to take.</p>, <p>'I wanted to only let the Professor escape, but that would indeed be a little too suspicious.'</p>, <p>After hearing what he had to say, I knew that if he had been the only one to escape, then my chances of getting what I wanted would decrease drastically.</p>, <p>Furthermore, given that he was no longer a professor at Haven, his value to the organization wasn't very high.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I went along with his idea and saved Kiera's aunt.</p>, <p>Or more like...</p>, <p>\"Allowed him to save her.\"</p>, <p>The figure that I had stopped with the threads was none other than the professor.</p>, <p>It was merely an act.</p>, <p>....A way to make her think he was on their side.</p>, <p>I wasn't sure about the price my action would have in the future. Whether it would make Kiera turn against me, or whether the professor would end up backstabbing me, but...</p>, <p>\"It's necessary.\"</p>, <p>I was alone. I needed allies. People I could use to help me uncover the secrets of this organization.</p>, <p>Exploiting the professor's weakness, I managed to get him to my side. However, how much trust could I really put in him?</p>, <p>The only thing I could rely on was his character.</p>, <p>Was he the same person that I had seen in the vision? If so...</p>, <p>\"It's worth the risk.\"</p>, <p>They were coming for me.

They could still feel the lingering heat from Kiera's spell as they immediately channeled their mana to cool themselves down.</p>, <p>Rose looked around in confusion. Then, as if realizing that they were no longer in the prison, she turned to look at Rober where she smiled.</p>, <p>\"It looks like you've saved me.\"</p>, <p>Catching his breath, he managed to say,</p>, <p>\".....I was only following the plan.\"</p>, <p>He glanced at the shattered glass in his hand. It was a one-time use relic that enabled him to teleport outside of the prison.</p>, <p>The organization had paid a massive price to get it into his hands.</p>, <p>There was also another inmate who had received the same relic.

It was rather unique.\"</p>, <p>Recalling the way the boy from before fought, and the emotionless expression he wore as he attacked her, Rose chuckled.</p>, <p>\"...An interesting one.\"</p>, <p>Such was her evaluation of him.</p>, <p>\"A very interesting one.\"</p>, <p>He definitely was.</p>, <p>\"But...\"</p>, <p>Rose looked around and tilted her head.</p>, <p>\"Are we the only ones here?

Entrusted with the Empire's administrative matters, the Megrail family not only tolerated their presence but also extended their support to them.</p>, <p>Central adopted a democratic approach, allowing the population to determine the allocation of seats among the houses within the organization.</p>, <p>Additionally, every four years, a new chairperson would be elected to assume control over the affairs.</p>, <p>Central.</p>, <p>A meeting was taking place.</p>, <p>\"What's the situation?\"</p>, <p>A tall man with sharp eyes and long black hair glanced around the oval table where several important figures sat. His husky voice seemed unfitting for his small frame.</p>, <p>He was a representative member of the Joltice House.</p>, <p>A Viscount family.</p>, <p>\"…..Everything is contained. All inmates have been locked up. However, we've received reports of several losses within the penitentiary. Over a dozen guards have been killed, and several cadets from Haven have died. It also appears as if several inmates have escaped the facility.

Representing the Verlice family, she was Johanna Verlice.</p>, <p>The conversation continued from there.</p>, <p>\"Do you know who is responsible for all of this?\"</p>, <p>\"Im not aware.\"</p>, <p>Massaging his chin, another member present within the room interjected.</p>, <p>\"…..From the reports I've received the organization is called the Inverted Sky.

It's strange. They're usually rather overbearing with stuff like this. Why are they suddenly so quiet?\"</p>, <p>\"It's because they can't do anything about them.\"</p>, <p>A crisp voice suddenly interjected and all members quiet down. Sitting at the end of the table was an enchanting woman with long black hair and deep black eyes. She was none other than Delilah.</p>, <p>The one closest to the Zenith.</p>, <p>\"The Inverted Sky is an organization that even the Royal Family has trouble dealing with.\"</p>, <p>Her words brought a certain shock to the room.</p>, <p>While she wasn't exactly a member of Central, her family was. She took advantage of the sudden situation to make an appearance.</p>, <p>\"Even the Royal family...? How come we've only heard about them now? How does that even make sense?\"</p>, <p>Delilah stared at the members and held back her smirk.</p>, <p>Witnessing such esteemed figures at the helm of the Empire appear so clueless, Delilah couldn't help but feel a certain sense of amusement about the situation.</p>, <p>\"We don't know much about the Inverted Sky. However, if there's one thing that I do know is that they are an organization that is much older than the Empire. They date back to the Era of the Shattered World.\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>The looks of shock on the faces of the members were something that Delilah took in with gusto.</p>, <p>It had to be noted that the Era of the Shattered World occurred several thousand years ago.</p>, <p> To put that into perspective, the Empire wasn't even half a millennium old.</p>, <p>\"You ask why the Megrail family hasn't done a thing yet...\"</p>, <p>With cracks appearing on her usually stoic face, Delilah suddenly smiled.</p>, <p>\".....What other reason than fear is there? The Megrail family fears the Inverted Sky, and so should you.\"</p>, <p>The temperature of the room dropped at her words.</p>, <p>Despite the esteemed status of everyone in the room, a palpable sense of unease descended as Delilah's words reverberated, casting a shadow of oppression over the gathering.</p>, <p>This was exactly what Delilah wanted to achieve with her words.</p>, <p>It was about time that the world was made aware of the organization that they were dealing with.</p>, <p>They had been in the shadows for far too long.</p>, <p>Now that they had started to show their fangs to the world, Delilah planned on dragging them out completely.

Frowning, Delilah turned her head to stare at the man seated beside her.</p>, <p>Meeting his eyes, her words remained stuck in her mouth and she turned her head away.</p>, <p>\"While my daughter's words are indeed true, there's no need to worry too much.\"</p>, <p>Despite being in the late sixties, his appearance was flawless. With two deep eyes that seemed to be able to suck in anything that looked into them, Orson Rosemberg, the current chair of Central, and Delilah's father spoke.</p>, <p>\"They may be strong, but the depth of their strength isn't as deep as Delilah is making them out to be. The one we should really be worried about is their leader.\"</p>, <p>His voice contained a certain magnetism that attracted the attention of all those who were listening.</p>, <p>\"Their gender remains unknown, and among the members of the organization, they are referred to as 'The one who walks among us',\"</p>, <p>Orson Rosemberg explained solemnly.</p>, <p>\"However, hardly anyone in the organization has ever seen how they look like or made contact with them.\"</p>, <p>He paused then and looked up to take in the expressions of all members in the room.</p>, <p>\"There's not much that we know about them. There are records dating back to the Era of the Shattered World. However, the records are inconsistent. I've yet to find anything concrete.\"</p>, <p>Narrowing his eyes, he interlocked his hands.</p>, <p>\"However, if there's one thing that I'm certain of is that...\"</p>, <p>He paused and took a small breath.</p>, <p>\".....A human can't possibly have survived for so long.\"</p>, <p>His hands gradually tensed.</p>, <p>\"It's impossible.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Haven.</p>, <p>In the end, the event proceeded as it did in the vision. There was no difference whatsoever.</p>, <p>—Clandice Brow. Jordan Watson. Emile Black…</p>, <p>Names began to flow forth, accompanied by a somber atmosphere that enveloped the surroundings. Subtle cries echoed in the otherwise silent air as Herman Chambers solemnly recited the names of the fallen cadets.</p>, <p>—This is a sad day for all of us. They were bright cadets with a bright future ahead. It's…</p>, <p>I looked around me and took in the sight.</p>, <p>A part of me felt responsible for this.Could I have saved them? Possibly.</p>, <p>However, that was a hard if. There were certain things that I could've done to ensure that at least one person could've been saved.</p>, <p>I knew that.</p>, <p>However, I also knew that such action would bring risk and danger to me.</p>, <p>.....I didn't want people to die.</p>, <p>However, I also knew that I wasn't someone capable of helping everyone. It wasn't my job to help everyone.</p>, <p>That job belonged to someone else.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I turned to look in the distance where a figure stood. Even now, his appearance attracted the attention of all those around him.</p>, <p>His face remained stoic and emotionless.</p>, <p>However, seeing how tightly his fists were clenched, I knew he was probably blaming himself for the situation.</p>, <p>'Right... It's your job to feel guilty for their deaths.'</p>, <p>I wasn't allowed to have such feelings. I couldn't allow myself to have such feelings. The world was ready to eat me at any mistake.</p>, <p>I couldn't be the hero.</p>, <p>That was something that I couldn't afford to be.</p>, <p>I was just…</p>, <p>A drifting pebble that was trying to stay afloat in this unfamiliar world.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\".....I should get ready.\"</p>, <p>Late into the night.</p>, <p>It had been a few hours since the ceremony, and people were slowly starting to head back into their dorms to mourn the losses of their friends.</p>, <p>I spent the time focusing on increasing my experience.</p>, <p>Having failed the mission, I didn't gain the required experience to rank up. The loss felt rather painful since it was going to set me back a week.</p>, <p>However, it was a loss that I was willing to take.</p>, <p>\"Failure is already something I'm used to.\"</p>, <p>Failing wasn't important.</p>, <p>Gaining something from the failure was the most important thing.</p>, <p>∎ EXP + 0.03%</p>, <p>∎ EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>∎ EXP + 0.02%</p>, <p>∎ EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>\"Huuuu.\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath and wiped the sweat from my forehead.</p>, <p>The progress was steady.</p>, <p>\"Fifteen left.\"</p>, <p>I looked at the experience bar and sighed.</p>, <p>I was currently at 85%.</p>, <p>Fifteen didn't sound like much, but when taking into account that I needed to reduce my sleep and drop everything else to even get a chance to get there, it wasn't something that I was keen on doing.</p>, <p>\"It's just not enough.\"</p>, <p>The Mana Synthesis book was too slow.</p>, <p>Well, at least for what I currently desired. I knew from the lectures that the effects of the book would diminish the higher the tier I was.</p>, <p>This meant that the moment I stepped into the next tier, things would progress even more slowly.</p>, <p>It was already rather slow for me. The idea of my progress slowing down didn't sit well with me.</p>, <p>\"....I need to get my hands on a better book.\"</p>, <p>That much became clear to me.</p>, <p>However, how could I do that...?</p>, <p>I had little to no money, and I had never played the game before.

            "[<p>72 Era of the Shattered World [2]</p>, <p>Chocolate...?</p>, <p>Why in the world would I have chocolate?</p>, <p>I stared at Delilah and shook my head.</p>, <p>\".....I don't.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>Delilah nodded her head with her usual impassive expression. However, for some reason, I could tell she was disappointed.</p>, <p>Call it intuition.</p>, <p>\"How may I help you?\"</p>, <p>I kept my cool and addressed her recently.</p>, <p>Surely she didn't come here in the middle of the night to visit me for the sake of it.</p>, <p>Looking around the room, Delilah sat down on one of my sofas and made herself comfortable.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I remained where I stood and quietly waited for her to say something. She eventually did speak, but the words that came out of her mouth stumped me.</p>, <p>\"It's four times now.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>Four times...?</p>, <p>What was that supposed to mean?</p>, <p>She elaborated.</p>, <p>\"It's four times now that you've found yourself in some sort of incident.\"</p>, <p>Holding up her fingers, she started to recount.</p>, <p>\"Survival training, Auction, Mirror Dimension, and now this...\"</p>, <p>Delilah raised her head to look at me.</p>, <p>\"Is it a coincidence?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>At that, I found the words that I had prepared in advance remain stuck in my mouth.</p>, <p>It was true. Now that I thought about it, I had indeed been in all of the incidents. For the most part, it was because of the quests.</p>, <p>But it was indeed rather suspicious.</p>, <p>\"...I am a very unlucky person.\"</p>, <p>Even I was surprised by the bullshit that was coming out of my mouth.</p>, <p>Well...</p>, <p>To some extent, there was some truth to those words.</p>, <p>I certainly wasn't a very lucky person. At the very least, I didn't think I was.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Delilah just stared at me with her deep eyes. I knew she didn't believe me. Eventually, her gaze lowered to stare at my right arm.</p>, <p> \"Show me your tattoo again.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I inwardly swallowed before obliging and rolling up my sleeve.</p>, <p>\"Oh?\"</p>, <p>It was to Delilah's surprise to see a cloth over the area around my forearm. Looking up, she meaningfully looked at me.</p>, <p>\"I don't know how to hide it.\"</p>, <p>And I truthfully answered.</p>, <p>It started to become clear to me that the tattoo on my hand wasn't something that I could randomly show off on a whim.</p>, <p>The organization that I was dealing with was slowly starting to reveal its fangs and more and more people were becoming aware of them. I didn't know much about them, and regardless of how much I tried to find anything about them, all I'd see was a blank road with no end in sight.</p>, <p>Nothing.</p>, <p>There was simply nothing.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I chose to hide the tattoo.</p>, <p>\"I believe this is the best course of action considering that it might get misunderstood for something that it isn't.\"</p>, <p>I carefully looked at Delilah when saying those words. I wanted to gauge her reaction or lack thereof.</p>, <p>She simply sat where she was with her legs crossed.</p>, <p>It was hard to tell what she was thinking.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She was just staring at me. Her deep eyes peered deeply into me, trying to suck me in. The longer this went, the more uncomfortable I grew.</p>, <p>Why isn't she speaking? What is she trying to do...?</p>, <p>In the silence that took over the room, her lips finally parted open.</p>, <p>\"I've asked you before, but does the words Inverted Sky mean anything to you?\"</p>, <p>Inverted Sky?</p>, <p>I thought about it long and hard before shaking my head.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Delilah silently nodded before standing up.</p>, <p>\".....I can't feel any lies coming from you.\"</p>, <p>Lies?</p>, <p>She can detect lies?</p>, <p>'Uh, right... Even last time she was like this.'</p>, <p>Tak—</p>, <p>Delilah placed a book on the table. I immediately felt my eyebrows raise at the sight of the book. Could it be...</p>, <p>\"Read this book. I'm not sure how much, but it'll help you out in the future.\"</p>, <p>\"Help me?\"</p>, <p>I looked at the cover of the book. It was completely blank and devoid of any illustration or font.</p>, <p>\"Don't think too much. It's a common book that you can find in the library.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...\"</p>, <p>\"You'll find it useful.\"</p>, <p>I didn't say anything from there. She seemed to want to help me, but at the same time, I wasn't sure what her real intentions were.</p>, <p>For now, I could only take her at face value and agree.</p>, <p>Either way, it wasn't going to hurt me. Whatever it was, it must have had some meaning to it. I planned on taking my time to closely examine the book.</p>, <p>\"Hm.\"</p>, <p>I thought she'd leave things there, but all of a sudden, she said something else.</p>, <p>\"As you've already probably guessed, I'm keeping you close to me to observe you.\"</p>, <p>Her words stunned me.</p>, <p>Although I had already managed to guess. For her to be so upfront about it...</p>, <p>'She really...'</p>, <p>Was someone I had a hard time figuring out.</p>, <p>If that wasn't shocking enough, all of a sudden, cracks formed on her face as her lips gently pulled up.</p>, <p>\"....I think I made the right decision.\"</p>, <p>\"What-\"</p>, <p>Before I even had a chance to say anything, her form scattered and she disappeared.</p>, <p>Like the wind, she simply scattered away.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>In the newfound silence that took over the room, I stood in a daze for a few seconds before eventually turning my gaze over to the book.</p>, <p>I picked it up and ran my hand over the hardcover. It felt cold to the touch.</p>, <p>Even now, I was still confused about her intentions. The more I thought about it, the more my head hurt.</p>, <p>\"Is she helping me, or using me?\"</p>, <p>I more or less knew the answer to that question, and I didn't mind it. So long as it benefitted me in some way, then I didn't mind getting used.</p>, <p>In the end, I had to just stop thinking about it and I flipped to the first page.</p>, <p>I was bound to find something from this book.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Laying my eyes on the first page, I read out loud.</p>, <p>\"Era of the Shattered World.\"</p>, <p>It was an interesting title, and it immediately gained my interest. I was just about to flip to the next page when all of a sudden something flashed before my eyes.</p>, <p>It was a simple notification.</p>, <p>One that I knew was bound to happen.</p>, <p>But even as it happened, I felt my shoulders grow heavy.</p>, <p>\".....I guess it's starting.\"</p>, <p>[Synchronizing]</p>, <p>Kiera Mylne : 2% ---&gt; 9%</p>, <p>The penalty of my decision.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A few minutes prior.</p>, <p>\"Ah, fuck... I forgot to buy them again.\"</p>, <p>Smack—</p>, <p>Kiera smacked her forehead and let out a curse. Rummaging through her pockets and finding nothing, she clicked her tongue and kicked one of the pebbles along her path.</p>, <p>Despite the darkness outside, the presence of lamps lining the path served to ward away her fear.</p>, <p>The thought made Kiera chuckle.</p>, <p>\"It's funny.\"</p>, <p>Her traits were purely [Elemental] with her skills rooted in [fire] and [darkness]. Despite her aversion to the darkness, her power was inexorably linked to it.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that she never used her other element.</p>, <p>She simply had a hard time using it.</p>, <p>But of course, that didn't apply to the events of the day prior when she went to visit her aunt.</p>, <p>Her anger had taken away the fear that she had towards the darkness.</p>, <p>\"Haaa.\"</p>, <p>Kiera suddenly felt her mood lift at the thought of her aunt.</p>, <p>Thinking about the death of that woman, Kiera felt like she was flying.</p>, <p>\"Finally, she's dead.\"</p>, <p>It sounded too good to be true. The woman who had haunted her for so long was finally dead. And to think, she was the one who ended up killing her...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Kiera felt an odd sense of relief.</p>, <p>Even though she had sworn to be the one to do it, she didn't think she'd have the opportunity to.</p>, <p>\"I can't believe it.\"</p>, <p>It still felt like a dream to her. A very nice dream.</p>, <p>In any case, Kiera's thoughts couldn't help but drift towards a certain figure. Had it not been for him, then she would've most likely died, or even worse, been kidnapped.</p>, <p>She hated to admit it, but...</p>, <p>\"I guess I owe him one...?\"</p>, <p>Tilting her head, she mumbled to herself.</p>, <p>\"Uh, no. Technically speaking he owes me one too.\"</p>, <p>Right...?</p>, <p>Kiera felt her face scrunch up and she ended up rubbing her head.</p>, <p>\"Ugh, fuck... This shit's so complicated.\"</p>, <p>Clearly, the values between their debts were quite different. He had saved her life, while she had... minded her own business?</p>, <p>There was an obvious mismatch in the level of their debts.</p>, <p>\"But still. What was he doing here?\"</p>, <p>Setting the fact that he had helped her aside, why was he there? She had sneaked in because she wanted to meet her aunt.</p>, <p>But what was the reason for his appearance?</p>, <p>He was also very strong. While it was indeed true that her aunt had her mana sealed and was just waiting to recover her strength, he had managed to keep up with her.</p>, <p>He was a far cry from how he was in class. He was definitely hiding his real abilities and intentions.</p>, <p>Of that she was sure.</p>, <p>The question was why he was doing all of this. What was his motive behind his appearance back at the lockdown cells and why had he helped her?</p>, <p>\"Surely he ha—\"</p>, <p>Kiera's words stopped all of a sudden. Her vision blurred and her surroundings started to change.</p>, <p>'What... What the...!'</p>, <p>A scorched smell lingered in the air.</p>, <p>The ruins of a familiar city and the lightning that crackled in the air. An air of oppression gripped the surroundings.</p>, <p>'....What's going on? Where is this place?'</p>, <p>Kiera found that she had also lost her voice.</p>, <p>However, she didn't need her voice to see what was going on. In particular, in the distance, she could see a figure.</p>, <p>They stood at the center of it all, their figure blurred.</p>, <p>Everything gravitated their way. As if the world revolved around them.</p>, <p>'What, why...'</p>, <p>There was something else that shocked Kiera outside of the blurred figure.</p>, <p>It was...</p>, <p>'Why am I feeling this way...?'</p>, <p>The intense feelings that were invading every part of her body.</p>, <p>All she could remember was feeling an intense hatred.A hatred that seemed to devour her entire body.</p>, <p>And all of it was directed toward the blurred figure in the distance. For what reason, Kiera didn't know.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>All she could think about at the moment was the hatred she felt towards the figure.</p>, <p>It was intense, and Kiera had a hard time containing it.</p>, <p>Suddenly, Kiera felt her mouth part open as a voice familiar with her own rang out.</p>, <p>\"You... You are the one who let her go... I trusted you, and yet...!\"</p>, <p>Kiera felt her teeth clench as her body moved on its own.</p>, <p>Darkness started to spread over every inch of the land. It covered everything in its path, devouring all light from the world.</p>, <p>\"….I'll kill you for it!\"</p>, <p>The voice ended there as the world froze.</p>, <p>Not long after, the world started to collapse and Kiera found herself back in the park.</p>, <p>\"W-what...?\"</p>, <p>Kiera found that her voice was back.</p>, <p>But that wasn't enough to shake off her confusion.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>With heavy breaths, she looked around her.</p>, <p>\"What... Haa... the hell was... Haa... that?\"</p>]\n",

I eventually closed the book and sighed.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>It was certainly interesting information, but I still struggled to comprehend Delilah's intent behind showing me this.</p>, <p>\"What sort of connection is there between the organization and this book?\"</p>, <p>There didn't seem to be any connection with it. In fact, it only left me with even more questions.</p>, <p>Still, it wasn't as if she had given the book to me for nothing. There had to be something important in the book.</p>, <p>There was no way Delilah would give it to me for no reason at all.</p>, <p>It was for this exact reason that I opened the book again and immersed myself in reading.

The sound of scribbling rang out in the classroom. The preparations for the festival that was set to take place in three weeks were already in full swing.</p>, <p>Everyone was busy. Especially the cadets who not only had to get performance ready for the festival but at the same time prepare for the upcoming examinations.</p>, <p>\"Kill me!\"</p>, <p>Some of the cadets were already having a mental breakdown.</p>, <p>Kiera to be precise.</p>, <p>\"....I want to die! Just stab me with a long sharp sword. Whatever it takes.\"</p>, <p>From the way she was talking, it was obvious that she wasn't very excited about the upcoming exams.</p>, <p>I didn't know exactly how good her grades were, but judging from her expression and words, they were probably not very good.</p>, <p>\"Slow, quick, I don't care. Anything is better than this...\"</p>, <p>\"Ey~ It's not that hard. Just memorize the book. You're so dumb.\"</p>, <p>Next to her, Josephine shook her head with a laugh. Surprisingly, she was one of the more studious cadets. Not that I knew much about her.</p>, <p>\"What did you say?\"</p>, <p>\"Hm? It's not that hard?\"</p>, <p>\"No, the part before that.\"</p>, <p>\"Memo—Uakh!\"</p>, <p>Josephine let out a strange sound as Kiera's fist smacked against her head.</p>, <p>\"Bitch, don't pretend like you didn't say it.\"</p>, <p>\"Akh... My head. Fuck, I think I'm starting to understand how it feels to be like you...\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?!\"</p>, <p>\"Can the two of you stop?\"</p>, <p>It was Evelyn who put a stop between the two. Leon, who sat a few rows back also interjected.</p>, <p>\"The Professor is about to come.\"</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>Only then did Kiera finally stop complaining and focus her attention back on the paper in front of her.</p>, <p>I watched them interact from my seat before turning my attention away from them.</p>, <p>Talking about the festival, I hadn't signed up for anything. I thought about the stand-up, but I still needed to work on my delivery.</p>, <p>It wasn't quite there yet...</p>, <p>There were so many activities to choose from that I struggled to pick any. In the end, I just left it blank.</p>, <p>In case someone left their selection empty, then they would be directly assigned a role by the Academy. The same was true for cadets that didn't make the cut in certain roles like 'Guide' as there could only be so many people that could be selected for such roles.</p>, <p>'Actually, now that I think about it, I should be assigned a role today...'</p>, <p>I was curious about what it was going to be.</p>, <p>\"Ah, it seems everyone is here.\"</p>, <p>As per last time, a cheerful voice echoed across the class as Professor Bridgette entered the classroom. Sporting her trademark smile, she glanced around the classroom before taking out a small stack of papers.</p>, <p>\"I've received everyone's files, and have sorted through them. I will now be reading the names of the activities you have been approved for.\"</p>, <p>Taking one of the papers, she started to read.</p>, <p>\"Anders, you have applied for the Guide Role. After careful review, the board decided to approve your request.\"</p>, <p>Raising her head, her gaze fell on two people</p>, <p>\"Josephine, the same goes with you. You will work alongside Anders to ensure that all the guests will be guided around the campus during the start.\"</p>, <p>\"Eh...?\"</p>, <p>Unable to contain her shock, Aoife raised her head and let out a strange sound.</p>, <p>'She must've applied for the role, I guess.'</p>, <p>Seeing the shock in her eyes, it was clear that she had also applied for the Guide role. There were only two spots for it, and therefore, it was clear that she hadn't been selected.</p>, <p>The Professor went on to list the other approvals without offering her an explanation.</p>, <p>I took in Aoife's shocked expression and made sure to stamp it in my mind. It felt oddly satisfying.</p>, <p>'Uh, shit... This feeling again.'</p>, <p>I looked away from her.</p>, <p>Was there something wrong with me?</p>, <p>\"Next up, Kyle....\"</p>, <p>One name after another started to be recounted as more and more cadets started to get assigned roles. Some were happy to get their selected roles, while others were left disappointed.</p>, <p>Strangely though, there was someone who seemed to be happy for no reason.</p>, <p>\"Haha, fuck yeah...\"</p>, <p>I felt her gaze burn the back of my head when the list for the cooking activity was listed. Her reaction came out of nowhere.</p>, <p>'Is she happy that she didn't get selected or something...?'</p>, <p>If so...</p>, <p>Why did Aoife also look relieved?</p>, <p>\"For the stand-up. Unfortunately, none of the members of the class made it.\"</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>I was taken aback again. Turning around, I saw Leon hold his fist close to his face. Though his expression appeared blank, he seemed strangely happy.</p>, <p>\".....Was he that embarrassed last time?\"</p>, <p>I was starting to feel sorry for him.</p>, <p>\"I think that's all for those that made it.\"</p>, <p>Putting the papers down, Professor Bridgette looked up again as her eyes scanned the classroom.</p>, <p>\"For those that made the cut, congratulations. For those that haven't, please don't worry. We've already assigned you all roles in the theater club.\"</p>, <p>Theater club?</p>, <p>\"Think of it as an honor. Haha, who knows? If you're lucky, you might even get a chance to participate in the upcoming play. Everyone will be watching.\"</p>, <p>While I was still confused by her words, she continued,</p>, <p>\"But don't get your hopes up. The group that will be performing are all renowned actors. Your main job will be to tend to their needs and set up the stage for them. That being said, the Director has agreed to let the more outstanding cadets participate as extras. If you end up doing well, you might receive bonus credits.\"</p>, <p>Clap— Clap— Professor Bridgette clapped her hands twice and directed everyone's attention towards the blackboard.</p>, <p>\"With that settled, let's continue with the lecture.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The class went on for an hour. Once it was done, all cadets dispersed and headed toward their designated Activity.</p>, <p>I looked at the slip in front of me and headed towards the Leoni Hall.</p>, <p>That was where the play was going to be held.</p>, <p>\"A play, huh...\"</p>, <p>I didn't know how to feel about the situation. From what I heard, the chances of us cadets getting selected for the play were almost slim to none.</p>, <p>Not that I minded since I wasn't interested in acting.</p>, <p>I wasn't a very good actor so it was only going to end up with me embarrassing myself.</p>, <p>That meant that my job was just setting up the stage and props. That sounded easy enough.</p>, <p>\"I'll take it.\"</p>, <p>All I cared for were the credits.</p>, <p>The Academy Campus was large. It took me about ten minutes to finally arrive at the destination, and when I entered the hall, I was surprised by the chaos that caught my sight.</p>, <p>\"Over here!\"</p>, <p>\"Yup! Place that here!\"</p>, <p>\"No, not that one!\"</p>, <p>\"The lights are centered! Set it up properly.\"</p>, <p>If there was one word I could use to describe the current situation, it'd be 'Chaotic'. With people talking over each other, and props being moved around everywhere, there was no semblance of order.</p>, <p>\"Ah, cadet!\"</p>, <p>The moment I came in, someone tugged my arm and I turned my head to meet the eyes of a young woman with blonde hair and green eyes.</p>, <p>Judging from the clothes she was wearing, she didn't seem to be a cadet. Perhaps an organizer?</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>\"Are you here for the theater activities?\"</p>, <p>I thought about it before nodding.</p>, <p>\".....I am.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay, good!\"</p>, <p>The woman seemed delighted and I was suddenly dragged away by her. I wanted to ask her where she was bringing me, but just let her be.</p>, <p>I soon came to regret that decision.</p>, <p>'What am I....'</p>, <p>Standing at the center of the stage, I directed my gaze toward the four figures seated at the far end, below the stage.</p>, <p>Holding onto a paper, I glanced at it for a brief moment before looking up again.</p>, <p>\".....You may begin.\"</p>, <p>The fuck...?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The 'Curtain Call Collective' was a renowned association within the Empire.</p>, <p>Continuously filling theaters with their performances, no one was unaware of them. They were celebrities amongst celebrities.</p>, <p>Every year, they'd host a performance at the Haven Academy festival.</p>, <p>With many important figures showing up, there was no greater place to perform. It was for this reason that everything needed to be set up properly.</p>, <p>\"No, that's not right! Put it to the right.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes! Like that... no! A little to the left, yup, shit you went too much to the left again...!\"</p>, <p>The organizer of the event was a middle-aged woman known as Olga. Not only was she the organizer of the event, but she was also the scriptwriter of the play.</p>, <p>Her fame was about the same, if not greater, than the lead actors of the play.</p>, <p>Throughout the Empire, there were only seven plays that were rated Five-Stars, which was the greatest and most honorable a play could receive.</p>, <p>The criteria to receive such a rating was extremely difficult, making it a very prestigious and coveted rating.</p>, <p>Olga had yet to receive her first Five-Star, however with several Four-Star plays under her name, she was set to be the next one to receive such a reward.</p>, <p>Her latest play, 'The Wounds of the Moon' was something she had been working on for the past several years. It was her masterpiece.</p>, <p>For this reason, everything had to be perfect.</p>, <p>\"No! That's not the right place!\"</p>, <p>From the major details to the little details.</p>, <p>Everything had to be perfect.</p>, <p>\"Madam Olga.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes, right there.\"</p>, <p>\"Madam Olga.\"</p>, <p>\"No, you're-\"</p>, <p>\"Madam Olga!\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? Ah!\"</p>, <p>Startled, Olga turned to her left where a young woman with glasses stood. Sporting an annoyed look, she glanced around and sighed.</p>, <p>\"Madam, we're about to audition for the extra roles in the play. Several cadets are waiting to audition.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, right. I have to select one of them...\"</p>, <p>Olga's expression crumbled. As a perfectionist, Olga hated nothing more than having to taint her play by granting permission to amateur actors and cadets into her play. Regardless of how small their role was, Olga hated the idea of having them in her play.</p>, <p>If not for the fact that she was forced to do it, she would've completely rejected the idea.</p>, <p>\"...Fuck.\"</p>, <p>Her distaste towards the situation reached a point where she ended up swearing.</p>, <p>\"I can't believe I have to allow this.\"</p>, <p>The performance was extremely important to her. It was because it was so important to her that she had trouble controlling herself.</p>, <p>\"Bring me to them...\"</p>, <p>Clenching her teeth, she headed for the main theater which was currently almost completely empty. Waiting for her near the stage were three other people.</p>, <p>\"Ah, madame Olga, you're here.\"</p>, <p>\"Madame.\"</p>, <p> They were key members of the Curtain Call Collective, and judging from their expressions, it was obvious that they too felt the same way as her.</p>, <p>Wearing a helpless smile, a middle-aged man with a protruding belly and thinning hair, handed her a paper.</p>, <p>\"We will hold an audition for the minor role of Azarias.\"</p>, <p>\"Azarias?\"</p>, <p>Olga frowned and almost swore again.</p>, <p>A serial killer from an exiled noble who enjoyed killing people. With his bloodthirsty tendencies and hard-to-decipher intentions, he was the first 'antagonist' of the play.</p>, <p>A 'minor villain' one could say.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"I can't agree to this.\"</p>, <p>He was a key character. While he was indeed a minor villain, he was someone who propelled the main character towards the path that he embarked on.</p>, <p>How could they let anyone take on such a role?</p>, <p>\"I can't allow it.\"</p>, <p>It was for this reason that Olga slapped the paper on the table and shook her head.</p>, <p>\"You should all know the importance of this character. I won't allow it even if you force me to.\"</p>, <p>\"Madam, but-\"</p>, <p>\"No, buts! I won't allow it. Even i-\"</p>, <p>\".....You have no choice but to allow it.\"</p>, <p>A deep voice suddenly interjected, forcing Olga's mouth shut. When she turned her head, she almost cursed.</p>, <p>Standing a few meters from her was a tall and lanky man with thick squared glasses. Wearing an undervest without his blazer, his deep dark eyes scanned the surroundings.</p>, <p>\"The rules are the rules. Since you have signed up for this, you have to go through it to the end.\"</p>, <p>\"But Azarias is...\"</p>, <p>\"What other character then?\"</p>, <p>\"That...\"</p>, <p>When Olga was unable to answer, the man coldly cut her down.</p>, <p>\"Since you can't decide, be quiet and start the audition. You don't have a lot of time. There's a chance you might get lucky and find someone worth consideration.\"</p>, <p>Find someone worth consideration?</p>, <p>Olga almost scoffed at the statement. However, she didn't let it show and merely clenched her teeth.</p>, <p>\".....Fine.\"</p>, <p>In the end, she relented.</p>, <p>How could she even disagree?</p>, <p>His name was Adonis, and he was the primary investor in the collective.</p>, <p>None of the plays would come to fruition without him. From the actors to the props. All was paid by him. His commands were absolute, leaving her with no choice but to quietly accept the situation.</p>, <p>'Damn bastards.'</p>, <p>Suppressing her fury, she sat down on her seat and looked up toward the stage where one of the attendees was waiting.</p>, <p>Olga waved her hand to signal the start.</p>, <p>\"Send the first cadet in.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes!\"</p>, <p>Immediately, a cadet appeared on the stage. Sporting short blonde hair, and blue eyes, he appeared quite handsome.</p>, <p>\"Oh, he's quite good-looking. The audience might like him.\"</p>, <p>\"He can make up his lack of skills with his looks.\"</p>, <p>While the other judges were praising his looks, Olga wasn't interested.</p>, <p>The only thing she cared about was his acting skills.</p>, <p>\"I'm-\"</p>, <p>Olga cut the cadet off before he could say anything.</p>, <p>\"You have five minutes to get ready and study the script in your hands. Tell us when you're ready to start.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Flustered, the cadet immediately looked down at the paper and started to memorize his lines. Olga sat quietly and watched his practice. From the way he tried to change his expressions, to the tone of his voice.</p>, <p>In the end, by the time it was time for him to perform, a minute into the performance she waved her hand.</p>, <p>\"Stop.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>\"You may leave.\"</p>, <p>Uncaring for the cadet's expression, she looked towards the assistant.</p>, <p>\"Send the next one.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes...!\"</p>, <p>A vicious cycle started from there. A cadet would appear, only for them to be shut down a minute after their performance started.</p>, <p>\"Stop.\"</p>, <p>\"Next.\"</p>, <p>\"Send another one.\"</p>, <p>\"Is this a joke?\"</p>, <p>Olga didn't care for the cadet's feelings. Even as they tried their hardest, she rejected them the moment they made a mistake, or acted in a way that didn't fit her image of the Azarias in her mind.</p>, <p>Her actions didn't go unnoticed by the other judges who simply shook their heads and let her be.</p>, <p>\"Get out.\"</p>, <p>This persisted for several hours until the sun started showing signs of setting.</p>, <p>Glancing at her watch, Olga asked.</p>, <p>\"How many cadets left for the tryouts?\"</p>, <p>\"Five left.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Rubbing her head, Olga suppressed her urge to swear and took a deep breath. Another five? Kill me already... Then, with a wave of her hand, she muttered,</p>, <p>\".....Let the next one in.\"</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>Tak—</p>, <p>His appearance instantly grabbed the attention of all present.</p>, <p>Clad in the standard attire worn by all cadets, his garments appeared to contour flawlessly to his physique.</p>, <p>Moving with deliberate and measured steps, he maintained a stoic expression, methodically surveying his surroundings with cool indifference.</p>, <p>In the moment he appeared, the judges found themselves unable to tear their gaze away from him.</p>, <p>....All except for Olga who frowned.</p>, <p>Staring at his flawless appearance, Olga only felt disappointment. His face, expressions... It was as if she was looking at a blank piece of paper.</p>, <p>There was simply, nothing...</p>, <p>'Another pretty face...?'</p>, <p>The more she looked, the more disappointed she became.</p>, <p>In the end, she leaned back on her seat and closed her eyes. Having seen her fair share of performances, a judgment had subconsciously formulated in her mind.</p>, <p>'....Another bust.'</p>, <p>With a wave of her hand, she recited the usual rules.</p>, <p>\"You have five minutes to look through the script. Once you're done, please start acting. Don't feel too pressured. It's just a minor role.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It all happened so quickly that I had a hard time understanding what was going on.</p>, <p>I was standing in the middle of the stage with a script.</p>, <p>\"You have five minutes to look through the script. Once you're done, please start acting. Don't feel too pressured. It's just a minor role.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I thought of refusing, but when I thought back at Professor Bridgete's words, all thoughts of refusal disappeared.</p>, <p>'Even if I do end up embarrassing myself, it's worth a shot.'</p>, <p>Those extra credits... I certainly needed them.</p>, <p>I wasn't confident I'd be able to do well in the written and combat exams. Maybe I could, but there was nothing wrong with getting a safety net.</p>, <p>\"The character you will be auditioning for is a minor villain for the novel.\"</p>, <p>One of the 'judges' said in a monotonous tone. From the moment I entered, her eyes never let me. However, there was a certain indifference in her gaze that felt uncomfortable.</p>, <p>\"His name is Azarias.\"</p>, <p>Another judge started to speak. From the start, he seemed friendlier as he started to recount the scenario to me.</p>, <p>I quietly listened without saying a word.</p>, <p>\"A once noble, now fallen, banished from his family for his psychotic nature. From youth, he relished in killing, finding increasing thrill with each life taken. I want you to encapsulate the rage and madness that he feels when killing his first human.\"</p>, <p>I stood still for a moment and took in the information. 'Encapsulate the rage and madness that he feels when killing his first human.'</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>This scenario...</p>, <p>'It's familiar.'</p>, <p>To the point, it felt creepy.</p>, <p>It reminded me an awful lot of the first time I had killed someone. I could still vividly remember the emotions I had felt back then.</p>, <p>The state of madness I was in. The various expressions I had made. The smells, the sounds of everything around me... And the desperation that led me to that point.</p>, <p>I could still remember everything as if it had been yesterday.</p>, <p>To the point where I felt confident I could call forth those emotions again.</p>, <p>\"Do you understand the role?\"</p>, <p>The voice of the judge once again rang in my ears, prompting me to raise my head. In a softer tone, he continued,</p>, <p>\"Remember, this is just a minor role. You don't have to feel too burdened. I understand you aren't an actor. We won't judge you too harshly.\"</p>, <p>He smiled slightly.</p>, <p>\"You have five minutes. Please take that time to learn your lines and adapt to the emotions the character feels.\"</p>, <p>Glancing at the script, I shook my head.</p>, <p>\"There's no need.\"</p>, <p>\"No need...?\"</p>, <p>The judges's expressions changed as they looked at each other. The same was true for the woman who appeared indifferent from the start. In fact, the moment those words came out of my mouth, her sense of indifference appeared even more prominent.</p>, <p>\"Are you sure?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>I silently nodded.</p>, <p>There were only a few lines in the script. There wasn't much that I needed to memorize.</p>, <p>The only thing that one would need time for was probably for the emotional adjustment, but...</p>, <p>'I already know it.'</p>, <p>I had experienced it before.</p>, <p>For this reason, I didn't need the five minutes provided by the judges.</p>, <p>\"I can start now.\"</p>, <p>I was ready to begin even now.</p>, <p>Looking at each other, the judges signaled for me to start.</p>, <p>\"....Alright, you may begin.\"</p>, <p>Taking in the expressions of all the judges, from indifference to slight interest, my mind sank into my memories as I closed my eyes.</p>, <p>Gradually, I lost myself in those memories of the past, and when I opened my eyes again, the world was red.</p>, <p>My face twitched, and my expression changed.</p>, <p>So did the faces of the judges ahead as they witnessed me fall into madness.</p>, <p>A madness I barely managed to retain as my mouth gradually opened and I recited the first line of the script.</p>, <p>\".....The foundation of all masterpieces is a great start.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>His stoic expression showed cracks and his lips gently pulled up.</p>, <p>At that moment, the atmosphere in the room changed. It was as if an entirely different person had appeared.</p>, <p>Julien's once cold and serious demeanor had vanished, replaced by a deranged and mad persona.</p>, <p>\"W-what are you doing....!?\"</p>, <p>A random line was thrown by one of the judges. It was to signify the start of the scenario.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Julien lowered his head and gazed beneath.</p>, <p>The image of a woman appeared in his mind. One that lay on the floor panicking. He soon replaced her image with that of the man in the past.</p>, <p>His first kill.</p>, <p>\".....The foundation of all masterpieces is a great start.\"</p>, <p>The words came smoothly out of his mouth. They came out evenly, and calmly. However, mixed with the calmness was a certain hint of madness. It was subtly hidden, only discernable by the subtle trembling of his voice towards certain words.</p>, <p>It was such subtlety that brought Olga out of her indifference. She felt the hairs on her hand bristle upright as goosebumps ran down her body.</p>, <p>'The subtle textures of his expressions and tone...'</p>, <p>For the first time in her long career, Olga felt uncomfortable. The more she looked, the more she found herself feeling like she was standing before Azarias.</p>, <p>A psychopath who thirsted for the death of his victims.</p>, <p>'Just... Why am I feeling this way?'</p>, <p>Olga wasn't the only one who felt like this. It was the same for the other judges who shifted and adjusted their postures continuously.</p>, <p>They too were uncomfortable by the man that stood at the center of the stage.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>None of them could take their eyes away from him.</p>, <p>\"All artists crave to create their own masterpieces. I'm no different.\"</p>, <p>Julien scanned the room, his gaze lingering on the judges, his shifting expression revealing the growing madness in his eyes.</p>, <p>His chest heaved up unevenly, and the sound of his breathing took over the air that was swallowed up by the silence that ensued.</p>, <p>\"I want to make a masterpiece. A piece that will be synonymous with my name.\"</p>, <p>He continued to address the judges.</p>, <p>His tone started to change, slowly becoming tenser and more hoarse. Gradually, his smile became more intense.</p>, <p>\"....And so, the first brushstroke of this masterpiece shall be none other than your life itself.\"</p>, <p>Tak—</p>, <p>The wood creaked under his steps as he moved forward.</p>, <p>He appeared to head for the judges, his eyes never leaving them. Under his intense gaze, a cold chill went past their bodies.</p>, <p>Their instincts told them to run.</p>, <p>That they were currently dealing with a psychopath.</p>, <p>However, their bodies refused to listen. They continued to stare as he took another step.</p>, <p>Olga sat on her seat frozen. The theater had long disappeared from her vision. An environment had already started to form in her mind.</p>, <p>A medium-sized room that belonged to a well-off-noble and was decorated neatly with all the right furniture.</p>, <p> A figure lay sprawled on the ground. Her expression was one filled with horror. She seemed to want to run, but her body refused to listen.</p>, <p>All she could do was stare up towards the man who slowly bent over to grip her throat.</p>, <p>The madness in his gaze intensified as his expressions underwent several changes.</p>, <p>A fleeting smile of excitement would flicker, only to be swallowed by the engulfing madness that danced in his eyes. Rationality struggled to hold its ground amidst the tumultuous storm within him, as subtle hints of guilt seeped through the wincing of his features.</p>, <p>Olga swallowed her saliva.</p>, <p>\"He...\"</p>, <p>Had flawlessly captured the essence of the Azarias character she had penned.</p>, <p>A low scream echoed. One that was quickly suppressed by a hand. The furniture scattered, and legs and arms flayed in the air.</p>, <p>But it was all futile.</p>, <p>Under the madness. His madness. All she could do was watch with horrified eyes as her life slowly came to an end.</p>, <p>A heart-wrenching scene.</p>, <p>One that inevitably ended with death.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Azarias's heavy breaths echoed as he stared at his hand, feeling the mix of guilt, madness, and excitement after his first kill. It was perfectly embodied in that moment.</p>, <p>The scene deeply carved itself into the minds of the four judges who remained silent the entire time.</p>, <p>\"....I'm done.\"</p>, <p>A low and cool voice broke them out of their daze. The madness that lingered in his eyes, the sense of joy from the kill, and the guilt had all vanished.</p>, <p>Once again, his expression returned to that of a blank piece of paper.</p>, <p>The performance ended there.</p>, <p>Olga and the other judges remained seated in their seats at a loss for words. The performance had left them all stunned.</p>, <p>From the wide range of emotions he displayed to the expressions he made to mirror them...</p>, <p>It was a flawless performance. There was no denying it, and Olga found herself licking her parched lips.</p>, <p>\"What is your name?\"</p>, <p>She found herself asking for the name of the cadet.</p>, <p>Tilting his head, the cadet turned his head to meet her gaze. Just as he entered, his expression hardly showed any changes. Taking her in for a brief moment, he eventually answered.</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>\"Julien...\"</p>, <p>The name rolled well on her tongue.</p>, <p>Standing up from her seat, she carefully made her way toward him, stopping only when she was a few feet away from him. Getting a closer look at him and liking what she was seeing, she eventually nodded her head.</p>, <p>The more she looked at him, the more she felt like she was looking at Azarias.</p>, <p>'It's as if he's standing right before me... How can someone portray the essence of what I wanted so well? It's gone beyond just copying the character. It's as if he became the character itself...'</p>, <p>If there was one problem that she had with the performance, it was that...</p>, <p>'It's too short.'</p>, <p>It almost felt like a pity for such a great character to only have a few scenes.</p>, <p>The problem was that the script was already perfect as it was in her mind. There was no way she could extend his role, right...?</p>, <p>\"Hmm \"</p>, <p>Her brows furrowed as she once again turned to look at Julien.</p>, <p>Slowly, she extended her hand towards him and said.</p>, <p>\"Congratulations on making the cut. I'll sign your name up for the play. For now, I will take some time to make some adjustments to the script. I will send you the finalized version by tomorrow.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Please come this way. There are a lot of things that need moving.\"</p>, <p>Aoife, Leon, Evelyn, and several other cadets were brought into the Leoni Hall where they were immediately put to work.</p>, <p>Because their applications had been rejected, they had</p>, <p>\"Make sure you line the lights properly.\"</p>, <p>\"Cadet please be careful with that. It's very expensive. You will be held liable for the damage.\"</p>, <p>The situation was chaotic, but Aoife didn't bother and followed the instructions diligently.</p>, <p>'....I didn't get the role.'</p>, <p>Her mind was still thinking about the role she failed to get.</p>, <p>\"How?\"</p>, <p>Realistically speaking, she was the most deserving of the role. Not only was she an extremely well-known figure given her family name, but she was also well-acquainted with most of the members attending.</p>, <p>She knew their likes and dislikes.</p>, <p>There was no one more perfect than her to tend to their needs.</p>, <p>So why...?</p>, <p>Why didn't she get selected?</p>, <p>However, Aoife wasn't left discouraged for long. Looking around, she realized that this was another opportunity for her.</p>, <p>'If I can get into the play then I can get extra credits...'</p>, <p>Her acting was quite good. Having participated in several plays in the past, she was somewhat confident in her skills.</p>, <p>Furthermore, she was quite familiar with the members of the collective.</p>, <p>If all went well, then there was a chance of her getting selected.</p>, <p>Aoife was so immersed in her thoughts that she didn't realize someone was standing in front of her.</p>, <p>\"Ah, careful!\"</p>, <p>A voice warned her in the distance, sounded like Evelyn's, and before she knew it, she bumped into something hard.</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>Despite her fast reflexes, Aoife was unable to completely avoid hitting whatever was in front of her and fell on her butt.</p>, <p>\"Uh..!\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, she was able to keep the items on her from hitting the ground.</p>, <p>But that came at the expense of herself.</p>, <p>'....That hurt.'</p>, <p>Feeling the pain on her butt, Aoife tried her best to not show it on her face. She prepared to raise her head to apologize, but when she did, her expression froze.</p>, <p>A figure stood before her.</p>, <p>Sporting the same unchanging expression of his, he looked down on her.</p>, <p>Aoife half-expected him to say something along the lines of, 'What were you doing?' or something like 'Whatch where you're going', but contrary to her expectations he, extended her hand towards her.</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>The sight was a shocking one for her.</p>, <p>'He's trying to help me?'</p>, <p>She almost couldn't believe it.</p>, <p>And yet, staring at the hand, the unbelievable sight was unfolding before her eyes.</p>, <p>Still...</p>, <p>\"I can help myself up.\"</p>, <p>Aoife rejected the offer and helped herself up. It wasn't as though she didn't appreciate the gesture, but she felt uncomfortable with the idea of touching another man's hand.</p>, <p>\"...I appreciate the—\"</p>, <p>\"No. You're misunderstanding my intentions.\"</p>, <p>Her words were cut by his cool voice.</p>, <p>Turning around, she saw him reach down for a piece of paper that had fallen down on the ground.</p>, <p>Picking it up, he briefly glanced at her.</p>, <p>\".....I just wanted this.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, uh...\"</p>, <p>Weird sounds came out of her mouth all of a sudden as her eyes lingered over the paper in his hand.</p>, <p>\"...Eh?\"</p>, <p>For the first time in her life, Aoife felt her face burn.</p>]\n",

In a way, it was a pleasant situation.</p>, <p>Not only would it guarantee me extra credits, but it also wasn't dangerous.</p>, <p>\"I think I'm starting to get tired of all the danger.\"</p>, <p>I needed a little bit of a break from that.</p>, <p>However, there was a slight problem.</p>, <p>\".....I don't know if I'll be able to handle the other parts.\"</p>, <p>The only reason I was able to do so well so far was because I resonated with the character, or to be precise, the scenario.</p>, <p>All the emotions he felt in the script. Scene. I could perfectly resonate with them as I had experienced them before.</p>, <p>It was also for that reason that I was able to put on such a performance.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"That's the extent of it.\"</p>, <p>What would happen if I were to be put in a scenario I was completely unfamiliar with? How was I going to replicate the scenario?</p>, <p>I wasn't very confident in my acting.</p>, <p>\"Ugh.\"</p>, <p>My head throbbed the more I thought about the situation.</p>, <p>In the end, I decided to leave things be.</p>, <p>I was going to receive the script soon. When that happened, I'd be able to tell if I was screwed or not.</p>, <p>\"For now, I should focus on training.\"</p>, <p>I checked my experience bar.</p>, <p>\"Ten percent.\"</p>, <p>....That was about two days of training. Following that, I'd finally be able to advance to the next tier.</p>, <p>I couldn't wait for that to happen.</p>, <p>To the point where I immediately sat down on the ground and started to practice the manual.</p>, <p>I made a vow then.</p>, <p>Tomorrow or the day after...</p>, <p>\"I'm going to advance towards the next tier.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Late into the night.</p>, <p>Kiera stood in her usual spot, staring at the night sky from the window. Her gaze reflected the stars that shone brightly in the sky.</p>, <p>\"....What a mess.\"</p>, <p>It had been a day since she had that strange vision, and for some reason, it had never left her mind.</p>, <p>It was as if it refused to leave her thoughts.</p>, <p>She tried to act like nothing had happened during class today, but the images and emotions continued to haunt her until now.</p>, <p> \"The fuck is wrong with me?\"</p>, <p>It was already 1 A.M. and she was still up. She had tried to sleep, but the images and emotions continued to flash in her mind preventing her from doing so.</p>, <p>Sitting by the window, her gaze continued to wander towards the outside.</p>, <p>It was quiet outside. The faint glow emitted by the lamps softly illuminated the pathway below, while the grass and foliage gently swayed in the night breeze.</p>, <p>As Kiera let herself sink into the sight beneath, her eyes caught a particular image reflected in the windowpane. It was a sight that made her brows furrow.</p>, <p>'How many times has it been Ki? Clean up after yourself!'</p>, <p>'Look at this mess!'</p>, <p>'Why do you never listen to me, Ki? Is it so hard to clean?'</p>, <p>'Wait until you grow old and have children in the future. I want to see how you tell them to clean.'</p>, <p>\"Ugh, fine... fine...\"</p>, <p>Taking her eyes away from the window, her gaze fell on a misplaced sock.</p>, <p>Clicking her tongue Kiera got out of her spot and tossed it in one of the baskets for dirty clothes.</p>, <p>Her eyes darted across the room, looking for anything that was out of place.</p>, <p>Only when she was certain that everything was in place that she let out a sigh of relief.</p>, <p>\"Thank fuck.\"</p>, <p>There was nothing that irritated her more than disorderliness in her room.</p>, <p>It had to be perfect.</p>, <p>Scanning the room one more time, Kiera eventually plopped back on her bed. Her ruby-red eyes blankly stared at the ceiling above.</p>, <p>Her thoughts once again drifted towards the vision, and her expression couldn't help but crumble.</p>, <p>\"Again...\"</p>, <p>For how long was this going to continue?</p>, <p>It was starting to get annoying. No, it was already annoying. To the extent that she contemplated doing something she typically avoided doing.</p>, <p>\"....Should I?\"</p>, <p>The memories and feelings resurfaced again.</p>, <p>It was memories like these that propelled her to do something she abhorred.</p>, <p>Closing her eyes, the world around her began to be engulfed in pitch darkness. It crept out from her body, enveloping the surrounding area.</p>, <p>In the darkness that started to take over her surroundings, Kiera's eyes shook. So did her body.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Despite her best attempts at keeping her breath in check, Kiera was having a hard time keeping herself from keeping her breath even.</p>, <p>With each passing second in the dark world, Kiera found herself increasingly unable to conceal the lingering traces of panic and fear that were slowly starting to grip her mind.</p>, <p>Her palms started to feel sweaty, and her vision started to blur.</p>, <p>'Hold on... I need to hold on.'</p>, <p>Kiera fiercely bit onto her lips. A metallic tang clung to her lips as she bit down with force. A sharp pain invaded her mind, but she kept a firm mind.</p>, <p>'I have to hold on...'</p>, <p>More.</p>, <p>Longer.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa...\"</p>, <p>With each passing second, the rhythm of her breath grew more strained, laboring against her chest. Her vision blurred as beads of sweat multiplied upon her brow.</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip.</p>, <p>Despite that, Kiera continued to persist.</p>, <p>'More... Not now. Not yet....'</p>, <p>The darkness...</p>, <p>It was something that Kiera feared and despised. It brought terrible memories to her mind. Ones that she wanted nothing more than to forget.</p>, <p>However, darkness was also a part of her power.</p>, <p>Rejecting the dark was the same as rejecting half of her.</p>, <p>\"F-for the sake of finding more, I need to...\"</p>, <p>Her aunt was merely the start of her hunt. Even now, Kiera could vividly remember the past. An image conjured up in her mind. It was an image of a certain room. Her room.</p>, <p>The room was destroyed and in chaos.</p>, <p>Shattered glass littered the floor as the furniture lay overturned, their contents spilled and scattered across the room.</p>, <p>Drawers had hung open, their contents rifled through and discarded on the ground.</p>, <p>The once-cozy atmosphere she called her room was completely taken over by chaos and disorder.</p>, <p>\"....They were definitely looking for something.\"</p>, <p>Of that, Kiera was sure.</p>, <p>But that wasn't the only thing she was sure of. She was also sure of the fact her aunt didn't do this by herself. Someone or an organization had helped her achieve this.</p>, <p>Kiera didn't know anything about the organization. Regardless of how much research she put in and how deep she looked, her efforts brought her nothing.</p>, <p>The reason why she visited her aunt was because she wanted answers.</p>, <p>Answers to who the organization was and why they had done what they did. Of course, what would come after was their destruction.</p>, <p>Kiera's mind was firm on that.</p>, <p>Her life goal was to take revenge. At any cost, she planned on eradicating all members of such an organization.</p>, <p>\"Kh...!\"</p>, <p>It was for this reason that she pushed her fear aside and endured the darkness that surrounded her.</p>, <p>It felt cold.</p>, <p>....And lonely.</p>, <p>But even when she was under such stress, Kiera's mind remained firm.</p>, <p>'More.'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>At the same time, in an unknown location within the Mirror Dimension.</p>, <p>\"You're in luck. It looks like the higher-ups are quite happy with your performance.\"</p>, <p>A tall woman with long flowing blonde hair and red eyes, Rose, addressed Robert with a smile.</p>, <p>\"You're not half-bad for an ex-professor at one of the most prestigious academies in the Empire.\"</p>, <p>She patted him on the shoulder.</p>, <p>\"Anyways, follow me, I've got a present for you.\"</p>, <p>\"A present?\"</p>, <p>Robert tilted his head in confusion.</p>, <p>He was still trying to get accustomed to the new environment. Everything felt new to him, and the scale of the place left him astounded.</p>, <p>Looking around, it felt as if he had entered a new world.</p>, <p>A large dome that covered the entire space.</p>, <p>Buildings that seemed to reach the tip of the dome.</p>, <p>Moving boxes of metals, and colorful lights.</p>, <p>The place appeared like a completely different world.</p>, <p>\"You'll get used to it.\"</p>, <p>Rose reassured him while continuing to walk forward.</p>, <p>\"I too was like that the first time I came. Most probably, everyone was the same. None of us really know the origin of such technology and its place beside our leader. It isn't even a very large space. However, it certainly leaves an impact, doesn't it?\"</p>, <p>\"....Yes.\"</p>, <p>Robert nodded absentmindedly.</p>, <p>Everything felt so new and fresh to him. But at the same time, it also felt rather convoluted. The noise was quite intense.</p>, <p>\"The only one that probably knows the answer to all of this is our leader. He's the one who created this space.\"</p>, <p>\"Leader?\"</p>, <p>\"Mhm.\"</p>, <p>Rose nodded and didn't say anything else.</p>, <p>Robert followed her quietly from behind until he was eventually led into one of the tall buildings. The door 'swooshed' open, leaving the poor professor frightened as he moved back.</p>, <p>\"Hahaha.\"</p>, <p>Rose laughed upon seeing his reaction.</p>, <p>\"It won't bite you. Come in.\"</p>, <p>\"....Ah.\"</p>, <p>Swallowing his saliva, Robert nodded his head and followed along. 'Swoosh' The doors closed behind him, but unlike last time, he didn't have time to worry about the doors as his attention shifted elsewhere.</p>, <p>With polished marble flooring and bright overhead lights, a multitude of people wearing various types of clothing lingered around the floor, engaging in conversation with each other.</p>, <p>Once again, Robert was left at a loss for words, but yet again, Rose's voice forced him out of it.</p>, <p>\"Follow along. The elevators are here.\"</p>, <p>\"Elevator...?\"</p>, <p>Ding—!</p>, <p>The wall split open, and Robert's eyes widened.</p>, <p>Rose stepped in and dragged him along.</p>, <p>\"Don't ask too many questions, and just follow along. You'll get used to what you're seeing eventually.\"</p>, <p>The doors to the elevator closed, and Robert felt a sinking sensation. The sensation frightened him, but he chose to remain quiet.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right.\"</p>, <p>Recalling something, Rose rummaged through her pocket before taking out a small object and handing it to him.</p>, <p>\"What's this...?\"</p>, <p>\"It's called a phone.\"</p>, <p>Rose started to explain as Robert fiddled with the device.</p>, <p>\"It grants you communication within the headquarters. It won't work outside. I'm not too sure about the details, but it is what it is. You can use the device to call me or anyone that you may be acquainted with.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes...?\"</p>, <p>Blinking, Robert filled with the 'phone'. He had a hard time understanding its functions. He was prepared to ask Rose, but before he could do that, the elevator doors opened to reveal a large room where several people wearing white robes appeared.</p>, <p>\"Oy, Rick!\"</p>, <p>Rose called someone's name.</p>, <p>Eventually, one of the white-robed individuals appeared. Their features remained obscured by an unfamiliar cloth draped over their face, making it hard to tell what gender they were. Yet, based on the resonance and timbre of their voice, as well as the name Rose called them, they seemed to be male.</p>, <p>Robert felt Rose's gaze as she turned to look at him.</p>, <p>\"We've got a new one. Pass me a vial.\"</p>, <p>\"....A vial?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>With a nod, Rick left. He came back shortly after holding onto a small tube that contained a strange red liquid.</p>, <p>Robert squinted his eyes to get a better look.</p>, <p>\"This is?\"</p>, <p>\"For you.\"</p>, <p>Rose handed it to him, leaving Robert in a state of surprise.</p>, <p>\"For me?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes. It's your reward.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Looking at the liquid, Robert hesitantly asked,</p>, <p>\"But what exactly is it?\"</p>, <p>At this question, Rose flashed a smile. It was an eerie smile that sent shivers down his spine.</p>, <p>\"....Would you believe me if I told you this was the blood of a god?\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"The blood of a god...?\"</p>, <p>Robert stared at the vial with deep apprehension and a little bit of disgust. Seeing the look on his face, Rose laughed.</p>, <p>\"Haha, I was joking. There's no such thing as gods.\"</p>, <p>Her laugh sounded almost eerie.</p>, <p>\"....Well, at least not that I'm aware of.\"</p>, <p>Robert quietly nodded his head and waited for her to continue. Picking the vial, Rose casually glanced at it.</p>, <p>Rather than explaining, she asked a question.</p>, <p>\"What do you know about the age before the Era of the Shattered World?\"</p>, <p>It was a sudden question that Robert hadn't expected.</p>, <p>He stared at her for a moment before shaking his head.</p>, <p>\"I'm not quite well-versed in such matters. But from what I've read, our civilization wasn't developed enough to create records of it.\"</p>, <p>The Era of the Shattered World occurred approximately three thousand years ago. It was the Era where the first recordings of the Mirror Dimension occurred.</p>, <p>That was as far as Robert knew.</p>, <p>Was there perhaps more to it...?</p>, <p>\"I guess you wouldn't know.\"</p>, <p>Stroking her chin, Rose tilted the vial, allowing the liquid to move from one side to the other. The more Robert stared at it, the more uncomfortable he grew.</p>, <p>It really did seem like blood...</p>, <p>\"I also don't know very well. Only the big shots know the full story. The one thing I do know is that...\"</p>, <p>Rose slowly turned her head away from the vial to meet Robert's gaze. Suddenly, as if two hands had gripped his throat, he found himself struggling to breathe.</p>, <p>\"....The Mirror Dimension is not a natural phenomenon. It was something that was created by what we call an 'unrecorded' or in a sense, 'gods'.\"</p>, <p>Unrecorded? God...?</p>, <p>\"The deeper you venture into the Mirror Dimension, the more things you end up finding. Our organization has existed since the Age of the Shattered World until now, and even now we still don't know much about the Unrecorded. The only thing we managed to pick up is that there are seven of them.\"</p>, <p>Tak—</p>, <p>Rose gently placed the vial on the table next to her.</p>, <p>\"Some texts suggest that there had been a fallout between the Unrecorded, leading up to a massive fight which resulted in the shattering of the known world, and hence the Mirror Dimension while other sources say it was the doing of one Unrecorded who had gone against the others to seek Immortality.\"</p>, <p>\"Immortality?\"</p>, <p>\"Oh, yeah... We call them gods, but the unrecorded weren't immortal. Well, all except for one.\"</p>, <p>Frowning, Rose stroked her chine while mumbling, \"I believe the first one to die was Oracleus? He died not much after he received his powers.\"</p>, <p>Oracleus?</p>, <p>She shrugged.</p>, <p>\"The fragments are scattered so the information is still not there yet, but we don't really need to dwell too deeply into the ancient history.\"</p>, <p>Rose went on to continue.</p>, <p>\"Our goal is to collect information and relics.\"</p>, <p>\"Relics?\"</p>, <p>Robert raised his brow.</p>, <p> Relics were items that were imbued with mana and had special properties. They could be created by hand, or found in the mirror dimension.</p>, <p>Rose nodded her head.</p>, <p>\"Four in particular: the Extractor of Containment, the Astral Mirror, the Oracle's Eyes, and the Chalice of Collection. Our mission is to find and collect all four relics. Their importance is fundamental. They'll be the key to achieving our goal.\"</p>, <p>\"Which is...?\"</p>, <p>Rose smiled and shook her head.</p>, <p>\"The full expansion of the Mirror Dimension.\"</p>, <p>Robert's eyes widened at the sudden revelation. Though he had somewhat guessed, it still came to him as a shock.</p>, <p>Why? For what reason did they want the Mirror Dimension to fully expand? Before he had the chance to voice out his questions, Rose started speaking again.</p>, <p>\"We've yet to find any so far, but we're getting there. We've managed to narrow it down to a certain location.\"</p>, <p>Yet again, Robert was left shocked. A certain location came to his mind as he subconsciously mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Haven.\"</p>, <p>\".....That's correct.\"</p>, <p>Rose smiled.</p>, <p>\"Their scent... They're all there. All four artifacts are in Haven. Hidden somewhere or in someone's possession.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Robert felt his body grow cold at the sudden revelation. The pieces finally started to piece together in his mind all of a sudden as he swallowed his saliva.</p>, <p>\"I've seen your files. The one you were assigned to kill... He had the scent of one of the artifacts. It's a pity you weren't able to kill him, but you don't have to worry, there will be plenty of other opportunities.\"</p>, <p>Fiddling with the vial, she handed it to him.</p>, <p>\"Drink this. It's your reward.\"</p>, <p>Hesitant, Robert reached out to grab the vial.</p>, <p>\"....Is this really blood?\"</p>, <p>\"Hmm, who knows~\"</p>, <p>With a smirk, Rose's heel clicked against the marble ground as she turned to head for the elevator doors again.</p>, <p>\"It could be or could not be. It doesn't really matter. Just know this...\"</p>, <p>Her steps slowed briefly.</p>, <p>\"....The moment you drink that, your life expectancy will increase.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The days continued to pass.</p>, <p>It was now the weekend, and I was still stuck in my room. Today was an important day for me.</p>, <p>Staring at the bar and seeing it at 99%, I knew that it was only a matter of minutes before I finally ranked up to the next tier.</p>, <p>It was an exciting day.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I felt the mana inside of my body flow smoother and smoother. It was a weird sensation.</p>, <p>One that felt rather addicting.</p>, <p>Time continued to pass and the flow became smoother with each second that ticked. Not only that, but I could feel my mana core expand gradually as more and more mana started to seep into my body.</p>, <p>\"Hmmm.\"</p>, <p>At some point, I started to frown.</p>, <p>I felt weirdly bloated as more mana entered my body. It was as if I had eaten a full-course meal and then immediately headed to a buffet.</p>, <p>It felt... Uncomfortable.</p>, <p>But amidst the discomfort, I felt power surge through my body.</p>, <p>That feeling...</p>, <p>It blew all the discomfort out of the water as I persisted through it. Then... Amid my struggle, I felt something crack.</p>, <p>Cr-Crack!</p>, <p>It almost sounded as if a piece of glass had shattered. The sound was subtle and nearly imperceptible.</p>, <p>However, I caught it.</p>, <p>And it was from that moment that something within me changed.</p>, <p>The flow of mana inside of my body became faster and smoother. The core expansion stopped, and my perception of my surroundings changed a little.</p>, <p>It was an odd sensation.</p>, <p>I extended my hand forward and scooped it.</p>, <p>As expected, there was nothing, but...</p>, <p>\"It feels like I'm grabbing something \"</p>, <p>Was it the mana that lingered in the air? Or was it something else?</p>, <p>My mind didn't wander on those thoughts for much longer as I focused my attention on my hand where a magic circle started to form.</p>, <p>Clank. Clank. Clank.</p>, <p>Chains formed, wrapping over my arm.</p>, <p>\"....It's faster.\"</p>, <p>To my pleasant surprise, the time it took for the chains to appear was faster than before. It wasn't by much, but it was definitely noticeable.</p>, <p>\"Hahaha.\"</p>, <p>I laughed then.</p>, <p>It was a pleasant situation. Thinking about the fighting style that I had developed, this was certainly a massive boost for me.</p>, <p>\"....Would I have been able to win against her in my current state?\"</p>, <p>I thought back on the incident at the prison.</p>, <p>Back then, I had been able to contain her with my abilities. Had I been in the same situation in the past, but with my current abilities, would I have been able to achieve more...?</p>, <p>\"There's no use thinking about it.\"</p>, <p>I eventually shook my head.</p>, <p>There were no what-ifs and the goal had always been to let her escape. There was no use dwelling on hypothetical scenarios.</p>, <p>\"Finally...\"</p>, <p>A sense of relief washed over me all of a sudden as I leaned back and stared at the ceiling.</p>, <p>\"....I did it.\"</p>, <p>I had ranked up.</p>, <p>My chest felt light, and my lips pulled up. It was hard for me to contain my smile. I felt happy, and proud of myself.</p>, <p>The struggles weren't for nothing.</p>, <p>\"Huaam.\"</p>, <p>Yawning, I squinted my eyes repeatedly. Having neglected my sleep to achieve such a result, I was starting to feel tired.</p>, <p>I glanced at the time. 1 P.M.</p>, <p>\"It's still quite early.\"</p>, <p>Although I did want to sleep, I had classes tomorrow and I didn't want to mess up my sleeping schedule.</p>, <p>For that reason, I decided to go out and take a walk.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right.\"</p>, <p>I suddenly recalled something and a destination appeared in my mind. Without a second thought, I headed there.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Since the nearest city to the Academy was located about two hours away, the academy established a shop where the cadets could purchase basic necessities and food.</p>, <p>It was a famous spot with it being always full every weekday. The only times it was empty was the weekend when most cadets left the Academy to go to the city.</p>, <p>Currently, Kiera was facing a problem.</p>, <p>\"What do you mean, you can't sell me any more cigarettes?\"</p>, <p>She smacked her hand against the counter.</p>, <p>\"What sort of bullshit is this?\"</p>, <p>\"I apologize, but that's Academy policy.\"</p>, <p>\"Policy? What policy?!\"</p>, <p>Standing behind the counter was a middle-aged man with squared glasses and black hair. He stood stoically, unbothered by Kiera's fit of anger.</p>, <p>It was as if he had grown used to it.</p>, <p>\"I've received reports of you littering the buds all over the campus. Not only that, but you've purchased nearly all of the supplies that come each week. For those reasons, the Academy decided to put your rights of purchase on hold.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah!?\"</p>, <p>Kieara almost lunged over towards the other side of the counter. It was taking every bit of her willpower to stop herself from doing so.</p>, <p>\"I swear... You... This is nonsense...!\"</p>, <p>How could she accept this?</p>, <p>Sure, yeah... She did throw away the buds everywhere, she did indeed always buy all the packs available, but...</p>, <p>\"I can't accept this.\"</p>, <p>Smoking was like medicine to her.</p>, <p>Without it, she'd be...</p>, <p>\"Fuck!\"</p>, <p>The thought of not being able to smoke was starting to get to her. Just as she was about to scream again, a cool and even voice echoed behind her.</p>, <p>\"If you're not buying anything, step aside.\"</p>, <p>\"Which fuc-\"</p>, <p>Kiera's words remained stuck in her throat the moment she turned around. Standing taller than her, Julien glanced at her with his usually detached gaze.</p>, <p>She stood still for a moment, staring at him without being able to say anything.</p>, <p>Her thoughts continued to wander towards the time back in the prison. The time he had helped her.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>\"Uh, wait!\"</p>, <p>He moved past her before she could realize it.</p>, <p>\"How may I help you?\"</p>, <p>The cashier greeted him with a smile.</p>, <p>\"Fuck, this... Ah, whatever.\"</p>, <p>Kiera ended up letting it go. 'I guess I owe him and shit...'</p>, <p>Julien's gaze wandered around before settling to the right where the sweets were.</p>, <p>Tak—</p>, <p>He picked up a chocolate bar and placed it on the table.</p>, <p>\"Is that all? \"</p>, <p>Without answering, Julien reached out again and took another one.</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>And another one.</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>And another one.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>Gradually, chocolate bars started to pile up on the counter as he continued to grab bar after bar.</p>, <p>\"The fuck...\"</p>, <p>Kiera stood behind completely dumbfounded.</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>\"S-sir...?\"</p>, <p>Even the cashier was left dumbfounded by his actions. Just then, Kiera met Julien's gaze as he placed the last chocolate bar on the counter.</p>, <p>As their eyes met, she managed to pick up his low mumble as he went on to say,</p>, <p>\"Bribe. I'm getting bribes.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Tak. Tak. Tak—!</p>, <p>'...Is this enough? Or should I add more?'</p>, <p>It was a situation that left me stumped as I added more and more chocolate bars to the counter. It was slowly starting to pile up into a small mountain.</p>, <p>\"C-cadet.\"</p>, <p>My actions seemed to have startled the cashier who looked at me with a flustered look.</p>, <p>I ignored it and placed another chocolate bar on the counter.</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>This was an investment.</p>, <p>An investment for the future. Putting another chocolate bar on the counter, I met Kiera's gaze. Judging from her widened eyes, she too appeared to be at a loss for what I was doing.</p>, <p>I didn't feel like explaining everything, so I just said a few words.</p>, <p>\"Bribe. I'm getting bribes.\"</p>, <p>It wasn't exactly a lie.</p>, <p>These were indeed bribes. Or perhaps a means to build up favor?</p>, <p>'Well, whatever... It's not like they're expensive anyways.'</p>, <p>It was about 0.5 Rend per bar. Doable.</p>, <p>\"....Tsk. Whatever, I'm leaving.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>I turned around to see Kiera turn around and leave.

I closely examined the pile before me and shook my head.</p>, <p>'Not enough.'</p>, <p>I was just about to place another one when the cashier stopped me.</p>, <p>\"Cadet, that's enough.\"</p>, <p>He appeared quite flustered. Even more so than before.</p>, <p>I stopped then and looked up.</p>, <p>\"Is there a problem?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes...\"</p>, <p>The cashier went on to explain.</p>, <p>\"....If you end up purchasing so much, we won't have enough for the other cadets.\"</p>, <p>\"So?\"</p>, <p>How was that my problem?</p>, <p> \"It's Academy policy. Like the cadet from before, if you buy too much, we might have to ban you from purchasing goods. Our store was established for the well-being of cadets, not profit.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm? Ban?\"</p>, <p>I thought back to the time when I had just arrived at the store. Kiera had indeed been arguing with the cashier over something.</p>, <p>I didn't expect it to be because of this.</p>, <p>\"Yes, you will be banned. She's currently banned from buying any more cigarettes.\"</p>, <p>He tried to explain as politely as possible, but his voice came out rather strent. As if he was warning me.</p>, <p>I didn't put particular thought into his words.</p>, <p>My eyes wandered to the back where the cigarettes were.</p>, <p>'So she's banned from buying them...'</p>, <p>It would indeed do good for her to smoke less. Regardless of the world, it was bad for the body.</p>, <p>There would definitely be benefits to her restriction...</p>, <p>\"If you're willing to stop here, it will be 102 Rend.\"</p>, <p>The cashier's voice snapped me out of my thoughts and I looked up to him. From his expression, it was clear that I couldn't buy any more bars.</p>, <p>I looked at the pile in front of me and decided that it was enough.</p>, <p>'Worst case, I'll buy more when the time comes.'</p>, <p>I rummaged through my pocket and took out my wallet. There, I took out a bill and a coin. Just as I was about to hand it over to the cashier, my hand stopped.</p>, <p>\"Cadet?\"</p>, <p>I pursed my lips and looked up slightly.</p>, <p>Thinking about it for a good while, I clenched my teeth slightly and sighed.</p>, <p>\".....There's something else that I want to buy.\"</p>, <p>Only this time.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Ugh...\"</p>, <p>Sitting outside the store, Kiera groaned.</p>, <p>It was a shitty day.</p>, <p>Fiddling with her pockets, she touched the empty cigarette box.</p>, <p>\"...I hate this fucking addiction.\"</p>, <p>Rather than smoking out of pleasure, she smoked out of necessity. For that reason, the thought of not being able to smoke was already starting to trigger her symptoms, and she had smoked just an hour ago.</p>, <p>\"Damn, bullshit... It's not that big of a deal. What's wrong with me buying everything? Aren't I giving you business? Plus, what about the cigarette butts? Don't I pay the Academy enough to clean up after me?\"</p>, <p>Kiera's rumblings went on for several minutes.</p>, <p>It was good that no other cadets were around to see her. In her current mood, she was certain she'd beat any of those who would try to hit on her.</p>, <p>It was a daily occurrence.</p>, <p>\"Also, if we're talking about someone buying too much of the same thing, that fucker got over a hundred chocolate bars...\"</p>, <p>Amid her grumbling, Kiera thought back to Julien.</p>, <p>He came into the store with his usually stoic expression and ended up with all the available chocolate bars.</p>, <p>In fact, he was still adding more.</p>, <p>It was a sight that left Kiera at a loss.</p>, <p>\"....Does he have some sort of chocolate addiction?\"</p>, <p>Or was it sugar?</p>, <p>\"Whatever, I don't care.\"</p>, <p>Ruffling her hair, Kiera looked up towards the sky and grimaced.</p>, <p>There were bigger problems she had to deal with. Glancing at her hand, she could already see that it was starting to shake.</p>, <p>\"Can I last a week...?\"</p>, <p>She already knew the answer at heart. The thought made her sigh, and her body limped back.</p>, <p>Ding—!</p>, <p>The chime of the door rang and a figure walked out. Kiera briefly glanced at him before shifting her attention back towards the sky.</p>, <p>There was nothing that she needed to say to him.</p>, <p>Or so she thought.</p>, <p>\"Here.\"</p>, <p>\"....Um?\"</p>, <p>Kiera raised her hand and caught something. When she looked down, her eyes widened at the sight that greeted her.</p>, <p>\"What the...\"</p>, <p>\"I'm not getting you anymore. Make do with what you have.\"</p>, <p>He left after parting those words.</p>, <p>Kiera stared dumbly at his back. Her mouth opened and closed repeatedly. There were many things that she wanted to say, but couldn't find the words.</p>, <p>'Weren't you the same guy who looked at me in disgust the last time I was smoking? Weren't you the same guy who told me to stop?'</p>, <p>Fiddling with the pack in her hand, Kiera gently nestled a cigarette in her mouth. She didn't light it up and just savored the taste.</p>, <p>Staring into the distance, her expression changed a little.</p>, <p>The more she thought she knew about him, the more layers she started to unravel. It was strange. He was strange.</p>, <p>Nibbling on the cigarette, she mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Why are you...?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'Did I make the right decision...?'</p>, <p>I was a little conflicted about my actions. On one hand, I thought it was rather hypocritical of me given how I had acted before, but on the other, knowing the struggles that came with the addiction, I caved in and decided to help her out.</p>, <p>Smoking was sort of like a therapy for most people.</p>, <p>Some smoked for pleasure, while others smoked to forget or numb a certain pain.</p>, <p>....I didn't know her circumstances, but for her to be smoking so much, rather than addiction, I felt that she was trying to ease something.</p>, <p>In a way, I saw my past self in her.</p>, <p>\"It'll be the only time I'll do it.\"</p>, <p>Think of it as a form of apology for how I had acted during the first time.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath and stared at the sky.</p>, <p>With no clouds in the sky, it was a clear day. A sight I was starting to grow accustomed to.</p>, <p>Holding onto the bag that was filled with bars, I put them in my blazer and headed towards a certain destination.</p>, <p>\"Bribes...\"</p>, <p>Indeed, I hadn't gone to buy all these bars for nothing.</p>, <p>I had a goal in mind today.</p>, <p>Though I wasn't sure whether I'd be able to succeed, I thought that it'd be worth a try.</p>, <p>\"The worst that can happen is her rejection.\"</p>, <p>I could handle being rejected.</p>, <p>At the very least, it meant that I tried.</p>, <p>Making sure that the bars were safely secured with me, I took another breath and headed towards my destination.</p>, <p>\"For growth.\"</p>, <p>I mumbled quietly to myself.</p>, <p>\"....This is all for growth.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Deliah quietly sat on her seat. Ignoring the mess that had accumulated around her, her focus was on the paper in front of her.</p>, <p>It was an invitation.</p>, <p>[We would like to extend our invitation to you....]</p>, <p>The invitation was for the Arcanum Gala. An annual festival that involved all top figures in the Empire. It was a big event that was set to take place in three months time.</p>, <p>There was just one problem with the invitation.</p>, <p>\".....I don't want to go.\"</p>, <p>Thinking about all the gazes she'd receive, and all the people that she'd have to entertain, Delilah's mood plummeted.</p>, <p>She'd much rather stay here and tend to the cadets.</p>, <p>Even that was less of a hassle than the Arcanum Gala.</p>, <p>To Tok—</p>, <p>All of a sudden, someone knocked on the door and Delilah tore her gaze away from the letter. She didn't need to see to tell who it was as her lips gently parted open to say,</p>, <p>\"Come in.\"</p>, <p>\"Excuse me.\"</p>, <p>A figure walked in.</p>, <p>Standing tall, and with impeccable features, it was none other than her little assistant.</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>\"....What's with the sudden occasion? I don't remember calling you here.\"</p>, <p>\"No, it's not that.\"</p>, <p>Shaking his head, his steps stopped by the end of the desk. As his gaze bore down, Delilah met his gaze and frowned.</p>, <p>There was something odd about him today.</p>, <p>He reached into his pocket and slowly took something out.</p>, <p>Delilha's eyes widened slightly.</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>\"A chocolate bar...?\"</p>, <p>Her eyes fluttered slightly. Then, recalling the conversation she had not too long ago, she understood and reached for it.</p>, <p>\"You didn't have to.\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>He stopped her before her hand could reach the bar.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>\"....This isn't for you.\"</p>, <p>Julien's cool voice made Delilah frown.</p>, <p>\"Not for me? Then...\"</p>, <p>\"Not yet.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>He placed another bar on the table and Delilah licked her lips. She looked up to him. Just before she could say something, he cut her off.</p>, <p>\"I need help with something.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>It was then that she understood.</p>, <p>Her nose wrinkled.</p>, <p>\"....Are you trying to bribe me?\"</p>, <p>His eyes shifted away slightly.</p>, <p>This guy...</p>, <p>\"I'm not someone that can be br—\"</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>Delilah swallowed.</p>, <p>\"It's not going to wo—\"</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>Just how many...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>\"I-\"</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>Delilah swallowed.</p>, <p>There were a total of five bars before her. Five bars...</p>, <p>\"Do you think I can't buy them for my-\"</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>Her lips pursed.</p>, <p>This guy...</p>, <p>Delilah shifted her gaze away from the bars and back to him. Her face remained plain, with little to no changes.</p>, <p>\"What do you want?\"</p>, <p>However, her voice betrayed her upheaval of emotions.</p>, <p>\".....I'll listen first.\"</p>, <p>Only then did he smile. Delilah stared at his smile for a moment, her mind unable to process it. He looked... off? The smile. It didn't look very natural.</p>, <p>Why?</p>, <p>\"Faster.\"</p>, <p>He flatly said.</p>, <p>\".....I want a faster way to get stronger.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Despite having just ranked up, I wasn't satisfied with my current rate of progression.</p>, <p>The moment I reached Tier 2, I noticed that the rate of growth had started to stagnate. If I were to put all of my focus like before on the manual, I'd only be able to gain 3-4% a day. A vast difference from the 8-9% I used to receive.</p>, <p>It made sense in a way, but the progress was too slow for me.</p>, <p>And it was for this reason that I thought about asking Delilah.</p>, <p>Out of all the people I knew, she was the one person I thought would have an answer to my problems. She was the strongest.</p>, <p>Surely, she knew of a way, right?</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I invested a lot of my money in the chocolate bars.</p>, <p>Come, you are tempted, aren't you?</p>, <p>\"....You want a way to get stronger, faster?\"</p>, <p>Her tone betrayed her confusion as her head tilted.</p>, <p>I nodded.</p>, <p>\"My current rate of progress is too slow.\"</p>, <p>\"Slow?\"</p>, <p>She closed her eyes briefly. I lost control of my body the moment she did. It was as if I was floating in the air.</p>, <p>The feeling was only fleeting, disappearing just as fast as it appeared.</p>, <p>\"Wh-\"</p>, <p>\"You've reached Tier 2.\"</p>, <p>Her voice cut through mine as her eyes opened.</p>, <p>\"Are you not satisfied with your progress? It's in line with most of the more talented cadets.\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>It'd be a lie if I said I was. While it was indeed fast, when I compared myself with the top cadets of the Academy, I was hardly scraping by.</p>, <p>I couldn't sustain the unreasonable training schedule that I was currently putting myself through.</p>, <p>The gap between me and the others was getting wider and wider.</p>, <p>If things were to progress at this rate, then I was sure I'd soon lose everything that I had.</p>, <p>I needed more...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Delilah didn't say anything and just stared at me. She seemed to be in deep thought as her brows slightly furrowed.</p>, <p>I waited patiently for her to speak.</p>, <p>She was the only one I could think of for a solution. The other professors would just tell me to train harder or buy a better manual.</p>, <p>They also gave me a list of several exercises that I needed to follow which I did.</p>, <p>But it was still not enough.</p>, <p>\".....You seem rather desperate for growth.\"</p>, <p>The silence that gripped the room was broken by Delilah's words as she addressed me.</p>, <p>I took note of her expression before pursing my lips.</p>, <p> Desperate?</p>, <p>I wanted to laugh. I had long gone past the point of desperation.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer, but it was as if she could read my expression.</p>, <p>Gradually, her eyes shifted towards my right arm.</p>, <p>\"Does it perhaps have to do with what I told you?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Yet again, I didn't answer. It wasn't as though I didn't want to answer, but I just didn't think it was wise just yet.</p>, <p>....I didn't want my biggest secret to be revealed.</p>, <p>That I wasn't Julien, but someone else who had taken over his body.</p>, <p>It was a secret that only one person knew, and I planned on nobody ever finding out. It was a dangerous secret. One that I couldn't risk anyone finding out about.</p>, <p>If I were to agree, then there was likely a chance that I might be forced to reveal that I wasn't Julien.</p>, <p>'It also seems like she can tell if I lie or not.'</p>, <p>For these reasons, I remained hesitant.</p>, <p>\"Alright.\"</p>, <p>I thought she'd disagree due to my silence, but to my surprise, she ended up nodding her head and agreeing.</p>, <p>\"....You will?\"</p>, <p>\"Meet me tomorrow at 10 P.M. near the forest at the entrance of the Academy.\"</p>, <p>Delilah provided me with a date and time.</p>, <p>But before I had the chance to feel happy, she added.</p>, <p>\"I won't be doing this for free. I need a favor for you. You're free to agree or not. I won't force you.\"</p>, <p>A favor?</p>, <p>I swallowed to myself before carefully asking,</p>, <p>\"What's the favor?\"</p>, <p>\"It's nothing big, but before that...\"</p>, <p>Delilah extended her hand.</p>, <p>I tilted my head in confusion.</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>What did she want?</p>, <p>Following her line of sight, I had a sudden realization and I felt my lips twitch. Reaching out for my pocket, I asked.</p>, <p>\"How many?\"</p>, <p>\"All of it.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>Watching the door to her office close, Delilah stared at the pile of bars in front of her.</p>, <p>\"....He.\"</p>, <p>A weird sound escaped her lips as her mouth trembled. Hastily covering her mouth, she looked around.</p>, <p>\"Heh...\"</p>, <p>Her shoulders trembled.</p>, <p>This went on for several seconds before she took a deep breath and calmed herself down.</p>, <p>Trying her best to not look at the 'goods' in front of her, she leaned back on her chair. Her thoughts drifted back to Julien.</p>, <p>'Greedy'</p>, <p>Such were her thoughts at first.</p>, <p>That he was being greedy. His rate of progression was staggering. She could tell from a quick scan of his body that it hadn't come easy. There were traces of exhaustion all over him, and a lot of his muscle fibers were torn.</p>, <p>Were he to continue this way, he was inevitably going to die of exhaustion.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that she decided to help him.</p>, <p>\"Perhaps, rather than greed, he's being chased by something...\"</p>, <p>Something that he couldn't run away from.</p>, <p>Like...</p>, <p>\"The Inverted Sky.\"</p>, <p>What if...? He had truly defected from them? Thinking about all the incidents he had been in, it really did seem like something was wrong.</p>, <p>In all the incidents that he was involved, the organization appeared to have suffered some sort of loss.</p>, <p>All besides one...</p>, <p>\"The Prison Incident.\"</p>, <p>It was the only incident where the Inverted Sky managed to succeed. It was for that reason that she ended up visiting him.</p>, <p>She wanted to confirm some things.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>But he was truly a hard man to read.</p>, <p>A blank piece of paper.</p>, <p>....Or at least, that was what she thought until just a few moments ago.</p>, <p>For the first time, she saw something from him. The desperation he had for growth.</p>, <p>Why was he so desperate?</p>, <p>Delilah was curious. There was clearly something that he didn't want to say. She didn't push for an answer.</p>, <p>She didn't think he'd be that naive.</p>, <p>Her answers would come with time. Of that she was sure.</p>, <p>And for that reason, she agreed to help him.</p>, <p>\"....I feel like I made a loss.\"</p>, <p>The favor she asked of him wasn't anything big. She had only asked him to make it seem as though she wasn't doing this for free.</p>, <p>She had her own selfish agenda to fill by helping him.</p>, <p>\"It's only fair.\"</p>, <p>Delilah leaned back on her chair and blankly stared at the ceiling.</p>, <p>Her thoughts were broken by a sudden knocking sound and her body shot up from the chair and she lunged towards her desk where the piles of bars were.</p>, <p>To Tok—</p>, <p>\"Chancellor?\"</p>, <p>A woman walked in shortly after.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Only for her steps to stop at the sight that greeted her.</p>, <p>Blinking twice, Jasmine, the Vice-Chancellor of the Academy, stared at the scene before her with some doubt. She had come here to report on the current situation of the festival</p>, <p>Gazing at Delilah who was hunched over her desk with a towering stack of bars before her, she questioned the current view before her.</p>, <p>An illusion?</p>, <p>Jasmine blinked once only for her to see the same scene.</p>, <p>Pursing her lips, she quietly asked.</p>, <p>\"...Should I come back?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The next day.</p>, <p>At the training fields outside the lecture hall.</p>, <p>\"Today's class will be a bit different than usual. Each of you will be secretly assigned a cadet's name and during class, your job will be to closely examine their weaknesses and strengths.\"</p>, <p>The Professor in charge of today's class was a tall and bulky man with a bald head. If there was one class that I looked forward to the least then it was probably this one.</p>, <p>[Physical training and For execution]</p>, <p>It was a class that was mainly dedicated to those who were adept in the [Body] classification. However, just because it tended towards those who were more adept in the [Body] classification, it didn't mean that it wouldn't be useful for the others.</p>, <p>Everyone was capable of practicing the three paths.</p>, <p>Those with talents were just capable of learning it faster.</p>, <p>\"Please pay attention.\"</p>, <p>The Professor's loud voice rumbled throughout the training area as he pointed towards a small hat that rested on the ground next to him.</p>, <p>\"If you look over to this hat over here, you'll find the names of all your classmates. I want you to line up in an orderly line to collect the name of the cadet you will be in charge of analyzing.\"</p>, <p>A long and orderly line started to form while the Professor continued to speak.</p>, <p>I silently moved towards the line and overhead a few cadets speaking. Mainly Josephine and the others.</p>, <p>\"Hm~ I wonder who I will get? Heh. If I get that bitch, I'll make sure to give her a low score.\"</p>, <p>\"Bitch?\"</p>, <p>Aoife tilted her head.</p>, <p>\"Who else? Kiera of course.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>She nodded as if she understood.</p>, <p>\"I can hear you.\"</p>, <p>Too bad Kiera heard it all.</p>, <p>\"Hiii!\"</p>, <p>I ignored them and continued to pay attention to the Professor.</p>, <p>\"Remember. This is an anonymous task. The other party mustn't find who you are. If I receive any indication that you've disclosed this information or they've discovered your identity, you will fail the task immediately and forfeit a credit.\"</p>, <p>The banter and noise that surrounded the place ceased. All of a sudden, everyone's expression turned grim.</p>, <p>To lose a credit over such a task...</p>, <p>\"That's enough of me. Pick a name and we can start with the task.\"</p>, <p>In an orderly manner, one cadet after another moved up to the hate near the professor and picked up a card. The moment the cadets looked at the cards, most of them showed a change in expression.</p>, <p>Some were happy while others showed looks of despair.</p>, <p>I couldn't blame them. Some cadets were simply better than others, and it was therefore hard to understand what they were doing.</p>, <p>I quietly lined up from behind and waited for my turn.</p>, <p>It didn't take long and the moment I arrived by the hat, I reached out with my hand and picked up a card.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>My expression didn't change the moment that I picked the card.</p>, <p>However, the same couldn't be said about how I felt internally. Without looking back, I put the card in my pocket and left for the training area.</p>, <p>In the distance, I caught a glimpse of a figure.</p>, <p>He stood at the center with his sword already drawn. He began to execute a move.</p>, <p>His movements appeared fluid, almost as if there was no lag in them.</p>, <p>....My steps paused as I stared at the distant figure who appeared to have attracted the attention of all the nearby cadets.</p>, <p>[Leon Ellert.]</p>, <p>Why did it have to be him of all people?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>'.....I can never get used to this sight.'</p>, <p>I stood on my spot in awe of what I was seeing. It was hard to take my eyes off his movements. They were perfect. Almost like a work of art.</p>, <p>As my knight, I had seen him train before.</p>, <p>I had only caught glimpses of it, but each time, I'd be mesmerized by what I was seeing.</p>, <p>'As expected of the main character...'</p>, <p>Good thing that his actions attracted the gazes of multiple cadets. If not, I would've feared my identity as his analyst would've been exposed.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a small breath, I looked around me and settled my gaze on a training dummy off in the distance.</p>, <p>\"I should probably get to work as well.\"</p>, <p>The point of today's training was to display our skills on the training dummies scattered around. Powered by magical circuits, they could move on their own and could dodge and counter-attack.</p>, <p>They were the perfect puppets to practice on.</p>, <p>I was just about to head to one when I stopped again. My gaze once again fell on Leon.</p>, <p>Swoosh, Swoosh—!</p>, <p>The air whistled with each of his strikes. Leaning forward, the air tore and the sword cut through the air.</p>, <p>It was an instantaneous movement. One that took less than a second.</p>, <p>Picturing myself on the opposite end, the only thing that crossed my mind was,</p>, <p>\"....I'd die.\"</p>, <p>There was no other outcome. The speed and power of his strike was simply incredible. But that wasn't what prompted me to look at him.</p>, <p>For some reason, I couldn't take my eyes away from his feet.</p>, <p>Shifting with every movement, they followed a set pattern.</p>, <p>'Forward, left, forward, left, right, forward...'</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>'Forward, left, forward, left, right, forward...'</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>The pattern was subtle, but it was definitely there. Engrossed in his movements, I didn't notice that I was now the only one looking at Leon.</p>, <p>I only noticed when Leon stopped and looked at me.</p>, <p>Our gazes met and I looked around me.</p>, <p>'Ah.'</p>, <p>Without changing my expression, I looked back at him for a short movement and asked,</p>, <p>\"Do you think it's possible for me to be able to do your footwork?\"</p>, <p>\"Footwork...?\"</p>, <p>He looked surprised by the question.</p>, <p>\"You want to know if you can do my footwork?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>I quietly nodded.</p>, <p> Then, under his gaze, I started to mimic his movements. Forward, left, forward, left, right, and forward. My movements were rather awkward, but I didn't bother and continued to do them.</p>, <p>I didn't know whether they'd be useful to me, but I felt like I was onto something.</p>, <p>Performing the set of movements, I looked up once I was done.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Leon stood quietly with his brows slightly furrowed.</p>, <p>\"How was it?\"</p>, <p>He didn't answer immediately. Sorting through his thoughts, he quietly said.</p>, <p>\"It's rough.\"</p>, <p>As expected...</p>, <p>\".....I'll show you one more time.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>\"Make sure you watch carefully.\"</p>, <p>The situation took me by surprise, but I didn't waste it. I stood silently and stared ahead as Leon got into a stance.</p>, <p>He took a step forward.</p>, <p>I stared intently at his actions and deeply engraved every little detail. From the pivot of his foot to his breathing and hand movements.</p>, <p>While my focus was on his feet, I knew that the little details in the other movements were also of importance. The same was true for the mana flow. However, that part was a lot harder to see and feel.</p>, <p>Mainly because I couldn't see the flow. The only indication was from his breathing and the faint glow that traced over his sword.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>His sword flowed forward. Carrying on with the momentum, he pivoted slightly and stepped to the left. The transition was extremely smooth. It hardly seemed as though he had moved at all.</p>, <p>He continued.</p>, <p>His heel shifted, and he once again took another stop.</p>, <p>Forward.</p>, <p>His momentum never ceased. During each movement, the sword would seamlessly follow his movements, carrying forward and striking at the air.</p>, <p>Left again.</p>, <p>I studied everything.</p>, <p>I didn't let anything slip from my mind.</p>, <p>It felt as though I was close to grasping something. It made no sense. This was something that was specifically for [Body] type users, and yet...</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>The air whistled and my hair scattered.</p>, <p>\"....I'm done.\"</p>, <p>Before I knew it, Leon was standing with his sword sheathed. I stood in a daze for a few seconds before closing my eyes and nodding my head.</p>, <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>, <p>Without saying anything else, I headed towards a more secluded area and closed my eyes.</p>, <p>I traced Leon's movements in my mind.</p>, <p>From his leg movements to his breathing. I tried to mimic it but found myself having a hard time doing so.</p>, <p>It took me a good minute to get the breathing correct.</p>, <p>Only then did I open my eyes and step forward.</p>, <p>\"Forward, lef-\"</p>, <p>I stopped right on the second step.</p>, <p>It was as if my legs had been glued down by massive weights. It simply refused to take that step.</p>, <p>\"Why...?\"</p>, <p>I stopped and pondered.</p>, <p>Was there something with the movement? No, that was unlikely. I repeated the movement. This time without any mana.</p>, <p>It flowed smoothly this time.</p>, <p>\"As expected, the problem is the mana flow.\"</p>, <p>There was a specific mana flow that I needed to follow. One that only Leon was familiar with.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>This was a bit of a problem...</p>, <p>\".....Looks like I'll have to give up trying to copy him.\"</p>, <p>I thought about asking him about the mana flow, but that was probably too much. Furthermore, it wasn't necessary.</p>, <p>I only wanted to partially mimic his steps, not his entire movement or whatever that was.</p>, <p>He was a sword user, so it would be absurd for me to copy his movements in their entirety. What I needed knowledge of was the principle behind his movements.</p>, <p>How would such movements benefit me?</p>, <p>\"Let's settle with three steps first.\"</p>, <p>I let the mana flow inside of my body and extended my hand.</p>, <p>Clank, clank, clank—!</p>, <p>Chains manifested in my hands, and I took a step forward. I swung my hand at the same time.</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>The air whistled.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>I was just about to follow that up with another movement when my arm tensed and I was knocked forward due to the momentum.</p>, <p>Clank!</p>, <p>I dropped the chains on the ground as a result.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>I stuck out my tongue and took a breath.</p>, <p>\"I rushed.\"</p>, <p>The chain on the ground scattered, reappearing on my hand again. Before repeating the movement, I closed my eyes and imagined the path of my feet.</p>, <p>The same was true for the mana flow.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I didn't know how long had passed but as I opened my eyes again, I took a step forward. My squads tensed, and I swung down with my right hand.</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>I followed a similar pattern compared to my first try.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>\"Scatter.\"</p>, <p>The moment the chain was eye-level with my chest, I scattered it, and directly stepped to the left, following it up with another hand movement where a new chain appeared.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>My muscles screamed under the tension, however, I ignored the pain and continued the swing.</p>, <p>CLANK!</p>, <p>A loud clanking sound resounded and I dropped on my ass.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My breath was heavy and sweat trickled down the side of my face. Looking down, I stared at my hands. They were both blistered and bleeding. It felt as though I had just touched fire.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>However, rather than minding it, I felt like smiling.</p>, <p>\"....I did it.\"</p>, <p>It was still extremely raw, but I had found a way to further improve my new technique.</p>, <p>Clenching my hands and feeling the pain, I let a few seconds adjust my mind to the newfound pain before standing up and getting into a stance.</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>I planned on getting to at least three moves before testing it against one of the puppets.</p>, <p>'It'll probably take me months to completely master or get the hang of, but...'</p>, <p>It was definitely worth the practice.</p>, <p>Of that, I was sure.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Hmm~ Who did you get? Come on, you can tell me. Pretty please...?\"</p>, <p>Josephine rested her chin over Evelyn's shoulder as she continuously whispered in her ear.</p>, <p>\"Hey... I know you can hear me. Does my voice tickle?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Despite her efforts, Evelyn continued to ignore her.</p>, <p>Her attention was currently drawn towards the distance where a figure stood. With long flowing platinum hair and red eyes, she stood by herself in the distance.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>Her weapon of choice was her fists. Or to be precise, her body?</p>, <p>Deftly dodging the strikes of the dummy, Kiera appeared to be bored. Casually stepping to the side, she slapped the dummy's head.</p>, <p>Faintly, Evelyn caught a glimpse of a smile on her face as she did so, but pretended to not have seen it.</p>, <p>\"Hmm, so she's the one you're analyzing?\"</p>, <p>Josephine's voice once again made it to her ear. It tickled slightly, and Evelyn's brows finally furrowed as she took her gaze away from Kiera.</p>, <p>\"Are you done?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn pushed Josephine's face away.</p>, <p>\"What are you even doing here? Why aren't you doing your job?\"</p>, <p>\"Hmmm.\"</p>, <p>Josephine's shoulders slumped.</p>, <p>\"I tried, but he...\"</p>, <p>She sighed.</p>, <p>\"...He was so busy watching Leon that I ended up wasting ten minutes for nothing.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn blinked.</p>, <p>\"Your partner is Julie-\"</p>, <p>\"Hey!\"</p>, <p>Josephine hastily covered Evelyn's mouth.</p>, <p>\"It's supposed to be a secret!\"</p>, <p>'But you just said mine...'</p>, <p>Evelyn wanted to say, but couldn't because her mouth was covered. Still, she got her message through her gaze.</p>, <p>With a long and exaggerated sigh, Josephine waved her hand.</p>, <p>\"Alright, fine... fine...\"</p>, <p>And headed out.</p>, <p>\"....It's not like I'll see much.\"</p>, <p>She ended up grumbling throughout the way.</p>, <p>It was a known fact that Julien was weak. No, he was strong and weak... He was bipolar.</p>, <p>\"No, that's not how that works...\"</p>, <p>In any case.</p>, <p>He wasn't strong.</p>, <p>\"Where is he?\"</p>, <p>Looking around, Josephine squinted her eyes. Her body felt lifeless. She was feeling pretty lazy. It took her a moment to spot his figure in the distance. He seemed to be in the middle of challenging one of the dummies.</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Her eyes lit up a little.</p>, <p>That was going to be interesting...</p>, <p>\"Will he lose?\"</p>, <p>It would be pretty funny to watch.</p>, <p>With renowned vigor, Josephine headed towards a better area to get a better look. She had just arrived on her spot when he started.</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Her eyes immediately focused on Julien.</p>, <p>'So handsome...'</p>, <p>\"Ehm.\"</p>, <p>Clearing her throat, she put on a straight face.</p>, <p>'Right, right... I'm not here to admire his looks. I can do that later.'</p>, <p>In general, Josephine treated the entire situation lightheartedly. It was how she usually was. She never took anything seriously.</p>, <p>Furthermore, with her father being a renowned knight working for the Megrail family, she was well-versed in these types of situations. After experiencing movements characteristic of [Body] type and weapon arts, she perceived everything around her as rather boring—except for Leon, who stood out.</p>, <p>His swordsmanship was rather unique.</p>, <p>'I wonder where he learned it from...?'</p>, <p>It seemed just as advanced as her family's one.</p>, <p>Her thoughts continued like this for a few seconds, until...</p>, <p>\"Oh...?\"</p>, <p>Her face changed as her mouth hung open.</p>, <p>Clank, clank, clank—</p>, <p>It was fast. Almost seamless. There were a lot of wasted movements, but it was getting faster and faster.</p>, <p>A shiver gradually ran down her spine...</p>, <p>One that intensified by a loud metallic sound causing her to flinch.</p>, <p>CLANK!</p>, <p>The dummy was still intact, and the figure appeared to warn out. With blood dripping from his palms, and sweat endlessly pouring out from his face, it looked like a pathetic sight.</p>, <p>However, to the only one watching, she found nothing pathetic about the sight.</p>, <p>Especially after what had just seen.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>The situation left her stumped.</p>, <p>\"How am I going to judge this...?\"</p>, <p>What even was this?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Clank--!</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I felt a lump in my throat as I heavily gasped for air. I felt lightheaded and my muscles were screaming from the strain.</p>, <p>Even so, I felt satisfied.</p>, <p>\"It's something...\"</p>, <p>I could see myself progressing. There was still a lot of work to do, and I was still far from reaching something concrete, but...</p>, <p>\"I'm getting there.\"</p>, <p>I wasn't sure when, but I knew it was bound to happen. But the question was, \"How do I progress from here...?\"</p>, <p>I had the concept down in my mind. What I wanted to achieve, and where to begin. However, what I lacked was a fundamental understanding of the concept.</p>, <p>How exactly was I supposed to improve this new technique that I had just started learning?</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>I stepped forward and let the mana flow around my body. Unlike last time, I didn't call for the chains and simply moved my feet.</p>, <p>Forward, and left...</p>, <p>The entire time I simply focused on the mana flow. There was a certain mana flow that I needed to follow for this to work.</p>, <p>For what reason was the mana flow necessary?</p>, <p>The answer was simple. To reinforce the muscles and build up power. There was a massive difference between doing a regular punch and punching with a mana flow.</p>, <p>In this case, the flow was necessary to smoothly transition the power of the action between each movement.</p>, <p>Transitioning between each movement without a mana flow typically led to a loss in power and momentum. The mana flow was added to supplement such a flaw.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>I yet again stopped.</p>, <p>\"....Something isn't quite right.\"</p>, <p>Ignoring the pain that was currently gripping my hands, I thought back to the mana flow and movement. I felt like there was something missing from the entire action.</p>, <p>The problem was that I couldn't quite grasp the reasoning behind the feeling.</p>, <p>\"Is it the movement, or myself?\"</p>, <p>I wasn't sure, but it felt as though something was missing from the entire movement.</p>, <p>An extra step?</p>, <p>\"....Is it?\"</p>, <p>I tried and frowned. From the left to the right step. It flowed smoothly, but I felt like something was missing.</p>, <p>'The transition can be better...?'</p>, <p>I ruffled my hair.</p>, <p>\"Am I being paranoid?\"</p>, <p>I tried again, but nothing changed. It was obvious that I wasn't skilled enough to understand. I tried a couple of more times, but the result was the same.</p>, <p>In the end, I could only give up.</p>, <p>\"....I'll leave it at that for now.\"</p>, <p>Such little detail was for the more skilled version of me. Right now, I was far from skilled enough to tell.</p>, <p> 'I think the flaw exists, but I'm just too weak to tell... I'll leave it at this for now.'</p>, <p>Stretching my arms, I went ahead and started practicing again.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>I only stopped when I heard the professor's voice echo from the distance.</p>, <p>\"Time's up. Everyone, place your report cards on the table over here. You may collect them after everyone has handed theirs in.\"</p>, <p>I looked at my report card with a frown. Although I tried my best, I wasn't sure if it was enough.</p>, <p>The report card comprised four categories: observations, pros, weaknesses, and Conclusion.</p>, <p>This task wasn't just to help us learn about ourselves, but it was also to help us better understand how others practiced and learned.</p>, <p>It was an exercise that benefitted all parties involved.</p>, <p>I had a hard time filling the weaknesses area considering that it was an area that was outside of my expertise. Even so, thinking back to the movements that he had shown me, I could deduct a few things.</p>, <p>'Good thing I spent some time observing him....'</p>, <p>I placed my report card on the table where all the other report cards were placed. There were quite a few.</p>, <p>In the end, I was rather grateful for this training session. I was able to learn something due to it.</p>, <p>\".....I guess I should start observing others as well.\"</p>, <p>If I could learn something from Leon, then could I also learn something from the others?</p>, <p>Quite frankly, I didn't care about my pride. If it meant helping me grow stronger, I was prepared to ask those who disliked me for some advice.</p>, <p>Pride was meaningless when one had a goal.</p>, <p>\"You may collect your report card.\"</p>, <p>Once all the report cards were handed over, the Professor mixed them up a bit and ordered us to form a line to pick up our own cards.</p>, <p>I sort of understood where he was coming from by making this an anonymous observation report.</p>, <p>With everyone not knowing who their observer was, they could be as harsh and critical as possible.</p>, <p>The harsher one was, the more critical they were of someone's flaw. In a way, if a cadet took the criticism seriously, then there was a chance that they might be able to improve a lot.</p>, <p>Such were my thoughts as I headed for the desk and picked up my card.</p>, <p>\"This one.\"</p>, <p>[Julien Dacre Evenus - Observation Report]</p>, <p>Picking up the card, I moved the side before carefully opening it.</p>, <p>\"As expected.\"</p>, <p>It was harsh.</p>, <p>[Observation :</p>, <p>Julien appears to be practicing a new movement technique. From how rigid his movements are, I believe that this is the first time that he's tried such a move. There are glaring flaws in almost everything he is doing...</p>, <p>It went on a long rant about how I was doing a lot of unnecessary movements and that I was overreaching.</p>, <p>Nothing I didn't expect.</p>, <p>[Pros :</p>, <p>—Interesting concept.</p>, <p>[Weaknesses :</p>, <p>—Unstable control of mana.</p>, <p>—Poor form and lack of connection between movements.</p>, <p>—Lacks physical fitness to follow up on the movements.</p>, <p>—A lot of wasted movements.</p>, <p>[Conclusion :</p>, <p>Maybe due to his experimentation with a new technique, his manipulation of mana and physical form fell far below par. His actions lacked fluidity, and the mana seemed disjointed in its flow. My recommendation is for him to prioritize refining his control. Once he hones his ability to concentrate on mana flow and prevents it from dispersing between actions, then...</p>, <p>The note ended there.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Then what?</p>, <p>I flipped the paper over to check if there was more to it, but...</p>, <p>\"Nothing.\"</p>, <p>What?</p>, <p>I flipped the paper again, but regardless of where I looked, the note ended there. I frowned and stared intently at the report card. I thought about reporting it to the professor but chose against it.</p>, <p>\".....Are they implying that when I fix this problem it'll be something good?\"</p>, <p>That was perhaps what the pause implied. Either way, I knew what to do now.</p>, <p>\"Practice my mana flow and control.\"</p>, <p>I noticed it too while I was practicing. I wasn't quite able to get a grasp on what it was that was making it hard for me to connect the forms, but the report card made it clearer to me.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I put the card away and looked into the distance.</p>, <p>There, I caught a glimpse of Leon.</p>, <p>Staring at the report card in his hand, he wore a frown.</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>I almost laughed as I recalled what I had written. 'Does he think I'm spewing bullshit...?' He could very well be. I wouldn't blame him.</p>, <p>But I thought it was something that I needed to write.</p>, <p>Perhaps there was some truth to what I had written...?</p>, <p>\"Maybe he'll come to thank me later, or maybe he'll completely ignore it. \"</p>, <p>That was up to him to interpret.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Leon looked at the report card in his hands and carefully read it. While he wasn't sure who his analyst was, he had an idea.</p>, <p>He was curious as to what he'd say.</p>, <p>[Leon Ellert- Observation Report]</p>, <p>[Observation :</p>, <p>Leon practices a sophisticated technique characterized by a seamless flow and interconnected movements that focus on small movements and low mana exertion. It's...</p>, <p>The report was long and detailed. Leon was a little surprised by what he saw. However, it was just the standard talk.</p>, <p>There was nothing new to him.</p>, <p>[Pros :</p>, <p>—Seamless transition.</p>, <p>—Well practiced. It's apparent that the cadet has practiced the move thousands of times in the past.</p>, <p>[Weaknesses :</p>, <p>—None that I saw or am capable of seeing.</p>, <p>Leon paused there.</p>, <p>\"....I can't fault him there.\"</p>, <p>The technique that he was practicing was called [The Dance of the Whirlwind]. Unlike mages who learned spells that were ranked from beginner to perfected, users who practiced the [Body] classification learned 'Techniques' or 'Arts'.</p>, <p>They too had ranks to them. From one to five stars.</p>, <p>And unlike spells, they also didn't require a person to have a certain level of strength to practice them.</p>, <p>[The Dance of the Whirlwind] was a secret art that he had managed to chance upon.</p>, <p>The rank was unknown, but Leon was sure that it was high.</p>, <p>It'd be odd if Julien saw any flaws with his art.</p>, <p>Not impossible, but also very unlikely.</p>, <p>He continued to read the report.</p>, <p>[Conclusion :</p>, <p>There isn't much to elaborate on. It appears impeccable in every aspect. It could be my limitations preventing me from identifying any flaws or offering constructive feedback. However, I do notice a concealed issue within the movement</p>, <p>—a segment appears to be absent in the progression from the left to the right step. While some attempts have been made to remedy it, there still seems to be some lag...</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Leon's eyes paused on the last remarks.</p>, <p>His entire body shook.</p>, <p>\"Flaw...? Left to right step?\"</p>, <p>He found a hard time trying to describe the current situation. It wasn't because he was wrong, but because he was... right.</p>, <p>\"How did he know?\"</p>, <p>Leon recalled that he had only spent ten minutes observing him.</p>, <p>Had he figured something out in the ten minutes that he had been observing him?</p>, <p>....Or was there something else?</p>, <p>\"How does this make sense?\"</p>, <p>Leon wasn't shocked because he didn't know about the flaw. He did in fact know about the flaw. The 'Art' was incomplete with a few missing pages. He had already done his best to mend it and cover it.</p>, <p>That being said...</p>, <p>\"How did he figure it out?\"</p>, <p>It wasn't something that was supposed to be figured out with just a few moments of observation.</p>, <p>An idea suddenly struck Leon all of a sudden.</p>, <p>\"Does he...?\"</p>, <p>He stopped there and took a deep breath. He didn't jump to conclusions immediately. However, he couldn't stop himself from breathing more heavily.</p>, <p>Perhaps...</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>10 P.M.</p>, <p>I reached the entrance of the Academy where all that greeted me was the vast forest that loomed around it. A figure stood waiting for me near it. Dressed in all black, she seamlessly blended with the darkness.</p>, <p>\"Do you have it?\"</p>, <p>\"I've got the goods.\"</p>, <p>I took out a bar and handed it to her.</p>, <p>She nodded in satisfaction.</p>, <p>No, wait... Why does this feel so wrong?</p>, <p>\"Come with me. I'll lead you to a place.\"</p>, <p>\"Where ar-\"</p>, <p>Before I could finish speaking, she placed her hand over my shoulder and the scenery changed.</p>, <p>Swoosh! Swoosh—!</p>, <p>The heavy sound of water falling echoed within my ears as a large waterfall appeared in my vision.</p>, <p>\"Where...\"</p>, <p>\"This is where you'll be training.\"</p>, <p>Delilah said in a flat voice.</p>, <p>I looked up at her unsure of what she was trying to imply. We were perched atop a modest hill overlooking a basin of water below. A waterfall cascaded into it, its steady rumble echoing all around us.</p>, <p>\"You said you wanted to grow fast, correct?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I swallowed before nodding.</p>, <p>Cracks displayed on her indifferent face as she pointed toward the waterfall.</p>, <p>\"There's something beyond there. Beyond the waterfall. It'll be what you're looking for. However...\"</p>, <p>She paused and looked at me.</p>, <p>A thin smile displayed on her face.</p>, <p>\"It's going to push you to your limit. It might even be quite dangerous. Are you sure you want to do it? I'm not forcing you. The decision is up to you.\"</p>, <p>\"No, I'll go.\"</p>, <p>I didn't hesitate with my answer. This much was obvious to me.</p>, <p>Delilah nodded.</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>And nudged toward the waterfall with her chin.</p>, <p>\"Go.\"</p>, <p>I quietly nodded my head.</p>, <p>Without hesitation, I jumped down the small cliff.</p>, <p>Splash—!</p>, <p>....For growth.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Splash—!</p>, <p>I felt my body sink deeply into the cold water. At first, the cold took me aback, hitting me like a truck and taking my breath away.</p>, <p>However, I slowly started to get accustomed to it.</p>, <p>\"Huaaa!\"</p>, <p>Emerging from the water, I took a deep breath.</p>, <p>\"Huuu... Huu..\"</p>, <p>It was extremely dark outside, and I could hardly see my surroundings. I felt an eerie sense of dread floating in the pond.</p>, <p>The water was inky black, and as I circled my hands and legs to keep me afloat, I felt a nagging feeling at the back of my mind.</p>, <p>What if I'm not the only living being on this basin?</p>, <p>The thought sent chills down my spine.</p>, <p>Taking another deep breath, I threw those thoughts away.

With monsters belonging to the Mirror Dimension, it served to provide the cadets with real-life experience.</p>, <p>Strictly speaking, the cadets were only allowed to enter the cave after the first half of the first year.</p>, <p>However, considering how much he wanted to improve, she decided to let him be.</p>, <p>Of course...</p>, <p>She had a goal in mind with this.</p>, <p>Observe his skills.</p>, <p>\"....Oh?\"</p>, <p>Her hands halted as she observed several slender threads extending from his arm. They wrapped around his arm, and scattered around the cave limiting the space available for the monsters to approach him.</p>, <p>Not only that...</p>, <p>\"He's merged the skill with a spell. How intriguing...\"</p>, <p>It wasn't a unique concept or anything like that. However, it was certainly not something that all cadets knew how to do.</p>, <p>In this case, it also provided him with breathing space as the monsters didn't directly pounce him from all sides.</p>, <p>\"Not bad.\"</p>, <p>Such was her current evaluation.</p>, <p>Not bad.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Another change unfolded as a chain materialized on his opposite hand.</p>, <p>With one hand ensnaring the monsters with threads to impede their movements, he wielded the chains on his other hand adeptly, simultaneously defending and launching attacks.</p>, <p>Shifting between attack and offense.</p>, <p>What grabbed Delilah's attention was his footwork.</p>, <p>It was... Raw. However, there was something to them. In a way, it appeared to be the key to his transition between his offense and defense.</p>, <p>The more Delilah watched, the more surprised she became.</p>, <p>She fell silent, silently observing Julien in the distance.</p>, <p>It was obvious that he had just learned this method given how rigid some of his movements were, but...</p>, <p>What would happen were he to master everything?</p>, <p>Just how much stronger would he become?</p>, <p>Lost in her own thoughts, Delilah didn't realize that her grip over the bar had faltered.</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>By the time she realized, the bar had dropped from her grasp.</p>, <p>\"Ah, no...!\"</p>, <p>Delilah reached out for it, but given her small stature, she was unable to grab it. Her little hands were simply useless.</p>, <p>While there were advantages to her polymorph skill, there were also disadvantages.</p>, <p>One such disadvantage was that her powers were reduced and it would take several seconds for her to change back.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>In the silence that unfolded around her, Delilah could only watch in despair as the bar dropped to the ground.</p>, <p>Plop—!</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>The bar sank deeply into the water, blending with the darkness surrounding it.</p>, <p>With her ability, Delilah could still see the bar.</p>, <p>It was sinking.</p>, <p>Deeper, and deeper into the basin.</p>, <p>The sweet and savory bar. The rich, smooth texture that melted in her tongue. The satisfying snap that came with each bite...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Delilah leaned back and blankly stared at the sky.</p>, <p>Gaze : Sadness. I've mastered it.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>In a dark room belonging to the 'Curtain Call Collective', a lone figure sat before a wooden desk that was dimly lit by a small lamp.</p>, <p>The sound of her pen scratching against paper reverberated throughout the room, punctuating the intense seriousness etched onto her face.</p>, <p>\".....Almost.\"</p>, <p>A dozen different papers were scattered across the room.</p>, <p>Olga found herself in a very dangerous situation. The script was ready. She had already handed it to the board of admission.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>\"No, I have to.\"</p>, <p>It was supposed to have already been perfect.</p>, <p>However, as she recalled the performance of the cadet, she found herself unable to sleep.</p>, <p>His performance...</p>, <p>It was just that impactful. It perfectly captured the essence of Azarias. In fact, his performance added a depth that she herself hadn't seen.</p>, <p>\"He's only got three scenes...\"</p>, <p>It wasn't enough.</p>, <p>She craved to see more of his performance.</p>, <p>\"It might ruin everything, but I can't help myself.\"</p>, <p>The script was perfect in every way. She was confident she'd be able to receive her first five-star grade, but...</p>, <p>\"I need more.\"</p>, <p>Of Azarias.</p>, <p>Of the cadet who played Azarias.</p>, <p>All writers wanted to create masterpieces. Even if they were confident that what they had was already a masterpiece, if a chance to improve the script further presented itself, they'd jump at the opportunity.</p>, <p>Olga was one such writer.</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>Olga who was obsessed with her script spent the entire night making adjustments to the script. Adding and removing scenes continuously.</p>, <p>She was a perfectionist. Unless all scenes seamlessly flowed together, she wasn't going to accept the scenes.</p>, <p>Thus, ever since the practice, she spent the entire week holed up in her room trying to improve the script.</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>Exactly one week after holing herself up in her room, Olga stood up from her seat.</p>, <p>\"Done...\"</p>, <p>A full script appeared in front of her.</p>, <p>It was at least a few pages thicker compared to the normal script. This meant that the play was going to run for longer than intended. That in itself was going to cause a little bit of trouble.</p>, <p>\"It's worth it.\"</p>, <p>The adjustments were perfect.</p>, <p>Azarias who was supposed to be just a minor character suddenly had a bigger role to play. He was still a minor villain. However, he now had incredible depth.</p>, <p>Not only that, but she hadn't just changed his scenes.</p>, <p>Olga had made minor changes to make the character more consistent with Julien.</p>, <p>\"Haha, this is...\"</p>, <p>Massaging her eyes, Olga pressed on the small orb beside her.</p>, <p>\"Rodney, I need a favor. I want you to call the committee over. I'd like to present a new script, and...\"</p>, <p>She paused for a short moment, tracing the new script over with her eyes.</p>, <p>\"...I'd like for the committee to grade the play during the festival.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The week continued like that.</p>, <p>Each night, at the same time, I'd go to the entrance of the Academy where I would be brought to the cave where...</p>, <p>\"Ukh.\"</p>, <p>I suppressed a groan and wrapped my arm. Blood was leaking, staining the cloth in red.</p>, <p>\".....How long do I have to do this for?\"</p>, <p>I looked around me. It was dark, but I could see the dozen or so corpses littered on the ground. A putrid smell lingered in the air, forcing me to wince at times.</p>, <p>Despite the many hours I had spent in this place, I could still not get used to the smell.</p>, <p>It was that strong.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I suppressed the pain and stood up. Looking at my watch, I sighed and extended my hand.</p>, <p>Thin, almost untraceable threads spread out from my forearm, circling each finger before moving out the area around me. Hiding around the crevices, and rocks scattered throughout.</p>, <p>It was hard to see in the darkness, but I was getting used to it.</p>, <p>\"Ten...\"</p>, <p>I started to count down.</p>, <p>\"Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four...\"</p>, <p>For every ten minutes that passed a new set of monsters would appear.</p>, <p>\"Three...\"</p>, <p>This was the fifth horde of the day.</p>, <p>\"Two...\"</p>, <p>And, the last horde of the day.</p>, <p>\"One.\"</p>, <p>Hieeeek—! Hieeeek—!</p>, <p>A sight that I had started to grow accustomed to. Over several dozen figures appeared at the back of the cave. Their figures blended nicely with the darkness, making it hard to distinguish what they were.</p>, <p>That... However, was of no importance.</p>, <p>I sightly raised my right hand.</p>, <p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>, <p>Light and rushed steps.</p>, <p>'Small...'</p>, <p>The sound gave away the size of the creatures. Judging from the frequency and weight of them, they didn't seem to be very large in size.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I waited.</p>, <p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>, <p>The sound neared.</p>, <p>They were only a few meters away from me. Their speed was starting to pick up. Even still, I did nothing. I waited quietly for them to come closer.</p>, <p>Clank. Clank.</p>, <p> Chains wrapped around my left hand as I brought it forward.</p>, <p>The dim, purple glow surrounding my left arm offered a fleeting preview of the path ahead. There loomed a colossal jaw adorned with countless rows of teeth curving inward.</p>, <p>\"Ah... Fuck.\"</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>As soon as my eyes landed on the creature, sparks crackled through the air, illuminating its form for me to get a better look.</p>, <p>Hieeeeek—!</p>, <p>It snapped at the chains with ferocity, prompting me to instinctively retreat several paces.</p>, <p>Before I could even process the arrival of the first creature, another materialized, adding to the otherwise precarious situation.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>I just barely managed to shift my hand to get it to bite at the chains.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>I was once again pushed back several meters.</p>, <p>When I managed to stabilize myself, I used the few seconds I had to myself to get a proper look at the creatures.</p>, <p>As expected.</p>, <p>\"A rat...\"</p>, <p>Fucking rats.</p>, <p>Hie! Hieeek—</p>, <p>Their steps hurried and I knew that I was about to be surrounded. It wasn't as though I didn't want this to happen. In fact, I was waiting for it as I clenched my right hand.</p>, <p>Puchi!</p>, <p>Blood splurted everywhere as the beasts shrieked in pain and the threads that I had laid out burst out.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I was immediately left out of breath the moment I called for the threads. However, I knew that I couldn't stop.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>\"Kh...\"</p>, <p>I extended my left hand, causing the chains to scatter as I pushed away the two rats clinging to them.</p>, <p>Hie! Hieeek—</p>, <p>Their red eyes glared fiercely at me as they crouched on all fours, their fur bristling in warning.</p>, <p>Amidst the chaos, the other rodents either lay lifeless or struggled to regain their footing.</p>, <p>Grazed by the threads, the creatures, already weakened by the curse of [Hands of Malady] intertwined with the threads, seemed to falter every time they tried to stand up.</p>, <p>\"Tsk...\"</p>, <p>Looking at my left hand and seeing the faint blood marks on it, I clicked my tongue.</p>, <p>\"....Still a lot of work to do.\"</p>, <p>Stepping forward, I raised my right hand and called the chains forth as they hung on my grip.</p>, <p>Sensing the impending danger, the two rodents lunged toward me with ferocity.</p>, <p>Too bad I was faster.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>With a swift swing, I landed a solid blow on both of the rodents, staggering them momentarily.</p>, <p>Without hesitation, I followed up with another strike as I smoothly transitioned the chains to my left hand, maintaining my fluid motion with careful flow and step.</p>, <p>Hieeeekk!</p>, <p>What came after the strike was one resounding shriek as afamiliar silence ensued shortly after as I took heavy breaths.</p>, <p>\"Haaaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>I fell on my knees and held onto my chest. My vision was blurry, and I could hardly focus.</p>, <p>Despite that, I didn't let my guard down and continued to look around at the monsters that were on the ground.</p>, <p>None of them were moving and were either in pieces or lying motionless.</p>, <p>Even so, I continued to stare at them.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The silence felt stifling and I swallowed.</p>, <p>'They're all dead, right...?'</p>, <p>They sure looked like they were.</p>, <p>Hiek—!</p>, <p>But the reality was different from my thoughts. Out of nowhere, as if they had been injected with some weird drug, one of the rodents abruptly stood up and lunged at me with all their might.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I was prepared for such an occasion.</p>, <p>With a casual swipe of my hand, the rodent separated in two.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>\"Haaaa...\"</p>, <p>Only then did I sigh in relief and relax.</p>, <p>\"....I've already learned my lesson once.\"</p>, <p>I recalled the first day of my training. I remembered just how much I had suffered. These little fuckers... They were crafty.</p>, <p>Extremely so.</p>, <p>Had it not been for the fact that Delilah was present, I feared I would've spent at least a few weeks in the infirmary.</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip!</p>, <p>Turning my head, I stared at my left arm which was bleeding from two points.</p>, <p>\"I thought I did good covering...\"</p>, <p>In the end, one of the monsters still managed to get a bite on me.</p>, <p>It was a bit disappointing, but compared to the first time when I had suffered bites everywhere, I was doing considerably better.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Slowly, I caught up with my breath.</p>, <p>I was finally done for the day. I felt tired and every part of my body hurt.</p>, <p>Leaning back on the hard ground, I blankly stared at the ceiling of the cave. It was dark, but I could faintly see it.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>Softly cascading from the overhanging rocks, water dripped in gentle touches, its calm rhythm punctuated by the distant rumble of the waterfall echoing in the background.</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and let the sounds enter my mind.</p>, <p>A picture formed and I basked in the sound.</p>, <p>Just then, I let my mind sink in deeply into itself. For just a brief moment..</p>, <p>I felt at peace.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The next day.</p>, <p>The preparations for the festival were in full swing. With only a week and a few days left, the campus was extremely busy.</p>, <p>\"Here you go. Make sure you practice this script. I've revised it to better fit you. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I took the script without saying anything.</p>, <p>Revised it to better fit me?</p>, <p>What sort of...</p>, <p>\"You may already have an idea of who Azarias is or was in the script. The concept will remain the same. He's a psychopath who thirsts for the death of his victims, however, there's a twist.\"</p>, <p>The woman, who went by the name of Olga...? Wasn't quite sure, but I addressed her as 'writer', and started to explain the plot and general idea behind the character that she had written.</p>, <p>The more she started to explain, the more I was convinced.</p>, <p>'....I can't do this.'</p>, <p>It was already a miracle that I was capable of performing the first part of the script, but as I scrolled through the script, I had a hard time visualizing the emotions and expressions of the character.</p>, <p>He was...</p>, <p>A total psychopath. Someone who killed for the sake of killing.</p>, <p>He thirsted for the thrill that came with the death of his victims.</p>, <p>'How am I supposed to play this?'</p>, <p>As I scrolled through the script, attempting to envision myself embodying the character, I encountered a persistent barrier hindering my ability to fully immerse myself in the scene.</p>, <p>Despite repeated attempts to visualize the scenario, I found myself unable to authentically inhabit the character's persona or effectively convey the emotions and actions as written in the script.</p>, <p>\"Can you do it...?\"</p>, <p>Overhearing the writer's words, I pursed my lips.</p>, <p>Could I do it?</p>, <p>The simple answer was, no. I couldn't do it.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>Was I going to do it?</p>, <p>That answer was obvious.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>For the credits, I had to do it.</p>, <p>\"Great. I can't wait to see your performance.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Inside of the Leoni Hall.</p>, <p>Things were hectic. With the festival date drawing nearer, the cadets and staff were busy handling all the important props and equipment up the stage.</p>, <p>Given that today the cadets who were going to become extras in the play were going to be announced, there was an obvious air of excitement.</p>, <p>\".....Yes, I'm done.\"</p>, <p>One such cadet who was looking forward to the selection was none other than Aoife.</p>, <p>She had applied a week ago when the auditions were on. Her role was that of an extra who was supposed to die at the start of the story.</p>, <p>Her killer was supposedly a wannabe psychopath.</p>, <p>It wasn't an important role, but to get extra credits she was willing to take on the role.</p>, <p>Her plan to become a Guide had failed, and since she couldn't do that, this was the next best thing.</p>, <p>'I have to get this role.'</p>, <p>\"Are you also waiting to hear your results, Aoife?\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Aoife turned her head. A tall man with soft blonde hair and brow eyes appeared in her sight. He wore a soft smile as he addressed her.</p>, <p>Judging from his uniform, he seemed to also be a cadet. A senior, probably.</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes.\"</p>, <p>Aoife casually nodded her head without displaying much interest.</p>, <p>No, she had no interest. The only thing that was in her mind was the selection.</p>, <p>'I'll get the role, right...?'</p>, <p>She recalled the expressions that judges had at her performance.</p>, <p>it was generally quite positive. At least, that was what she thought.</p>, <p>\"Haha, that's nice. I'm also hoping to get a role. I want to be Azarias. It's quite an interesting role. I think I'll be able to play it quite perfectly.\"</p>, <p>Besides her, the senior started to yap about himself and the role he selected.</p>, <p>\"In fact, I'm quite confident in getting the ro-\"</p>, <p>\"If you would excuse me...\"</p>, <p>Without looking, Aoife started to distance herself from him. Along the way, she came up with a random excuse.</p>, <p>\"Someone is calling for me.\"</p>, <p>Aoife left right after that, leaving the senior hanging.</p>, <p>She had no time for meaningless talk that was just going to end up with her finding out he was approaching her with ulterior motives.</p>, <p>Been there, done that.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>As Aoife left, the senior's gaze lingered on her retreating figure, his expression gradually contorting with an emotion difficult to discern.</p>, <p>His left eye twitched slightly, as a certain madness threatened to spill.</p>, <p>\"Oh, no. \"</p>, <p>He just barely held himself back as he scratched the side of his neck.</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>\"....Not yet. Not yet.\"</p>, <p>He quietly mumbled as he stared at the incoming member of the collective. Presumingly the person that would announce the result of the roles.</p>, <p>Massaging his face, a warm smile gradually returned to his face.</p>, <p>It wasn't yet time.</p>, <p>He had to remain patient. He was bound to get the role. The same was true for her.</p>, <p>Two contrasting roles, that marked the end of the start of their characters. Such were their roles.</p>, <p>....The stage was being set up.</p>, <p>For he would perform the greatest act at the greatest change.</p>, <p>An act to blow the minds of the audience.</p>, <p>One that would forever be remembered by all.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"Please be quiet. I will not be announcing the results of the assessment that we had. May the students who have been called up please step forward.\"</p>, <p>A man clad in dark green attire stood tall, his gaze fixed intently upon the paper before him. Adorned with thick, square-framed glasses, his stern countenance exuded an air of authority as he started reading the papers.</p>, <p>\"For the role of Evangeline, the selected cadet will be Aria Parlia from the second year. Please step forward.\"</p>, <p>A young woman with black hair stepped forward. Her features were rather delicate, and while she wasn't exactly the most attractive of women, she was above average.</p>, <p>The moment her name got called up, her eyes sparkled and her body trembled.</p>, <p>She seemed to be struggling to contain her excitement.</p>, <p>Aoife stared at her with a flat look. There was no hint of expression on her pretty features. She was quietly waiting for her name to be called up. Although she didn't show it, she was actually quite nervous.</p>, <p>She had rehearsed the script for countless hours and thought she had done a good job at it.</p>, <p>They had only been given five minutes to learn the script and act. Had she been given more time, then she would've been able to put on a better performance.</p>, <p>The thought of failing kept nagging at her mind.</p>, <p>It felt suffocating.</p>, <p>'I can't fail... Not again.'</p>, <p>And then...</p>, <p>\"For the role of Emily, the daughter of the baker, the selected cadet will be...\"</p>, <p>Aoife took a deep breath, silently squeezing her palms which had unknowingly turned sweaty.</p>, <p>\"...Aoife Megrail.

If not for the fact that she had to keep her image up, she would've jumped and clenched her fist in front of everyone.</p>, <p>Keeping her usual stoic expression, she glanced around at the other cadets who were looking at her with hints of envy and jealousy, and she stepped forward.</p>, <p>'I did it...'</p>, <p>Her fists clenched tightly.</p>, <p>The organizer started to name the remaining cadets. One by one, Aoife saw cadets either suppress their joy or weep in sadness.</p>, <p>Folding the paper, the organizer eventually, announced,</p>, <p>\"That's it for the roles. For those that haven't been called out, there's always a next time, you can disp-\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, excuse me.\"</p>, <p>A voice cut the organizer's. It sounded calm, but its underlying fluster did not escape Aoife's notice.</p>, <p>When she turned her head, her brows furrowed.</p>, <p>'It's him...'</p>, <p>The senior from before.</p>, <p>He still wore a warm smile and appeared friendly. However, something was unsettling about his smile that made Aoife frown more deeply.</p>, <p>He politely addressed the organizer.</p>, <p>\"I've yet to hear about the role for Azarias. I've applied, and I don't think it has been called out yet so I think there's been a mi-\"</p>, <p>\"No, there's no mistake.\"</p>, <p>The organizer cooly cut him off.</p>, <p>Glancing at the cadets who had stepped forward, Aoife included, he went on to say,</p>, <p>\"The role of Azarias has already been taken. He was selected a week ago.\"</p>, <p> \"Eh...?\"</p>, <p>Finally, cracks started to appear on his calm face. He appeared to be quite flustered. It was as if he hadn't expected such development.</p>, <p>\"Someone took the role?\"</p>, <p>\"But weren't the selections today? How could this be?\"</p>, <p>\"Is there some sort of mistake?\"</p>, <p>'Azarias's role has already been taken?'</p>, <p>He wasn't the only one that was surprised by the situation. All the remaining cadets, Aoife included were confused.</p>, <p>'Who took the role?'</p>, <p>Aoife was curious. He was supposed to be the one that killed her. They were bound to meet each other and work with one another.</p>, <p>\"That's enough questions. You will get to meet him later today if he's present. If not, you'll eventually get to meet him.\"</p>, <p>\"But, then...\"</p>, <p>\"That's that.\"</p>, <p>The organizer cut the senior off before settling his gaze over the Aoife and the rest. His tone softened a little.</p>, <p>\"Please follow me, I'll lead you all to our writer who will start explaining your roles.\"</p>, <p>He turned around and left after that.</p>, <p>Aoife didn't hesitate to follow. Losing all interest in the senior whose face turned completely white.</p>, <p>Her mind was somewhere else at the moment.</p>, <p>She was curious.</p>, <p>Just who was the one who was going to play the role of Azarias?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Alexander Harrington, a second-year Senior ranked within the top hundreds, didn't think things would turn out like this.</p>, <p>The itch intensified, and he began scratching his neck.</p>, <p>\"This... A mistake... How...?\"</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>As he scratched, a wet sensation began to creep along the side of his neck. He wanted to continue, but the wet sensation prevented him from scratching further.</p>, <p>Dabbing his neck with his sleeve, staining it red, he continued.</p>, <p>\"I thought I did good... Everything was perfect... How?\"</p>, <p>His sentences were incoherent, hardly making any sense.</p>, <p>—You weren't able to get the role?</p>, <p>\"No, I wasn't.\"</p>, <p>Alexander started to display some anger as he contacted 'them'. How could they lie to him? They promised him the role. What happened?</p>, <p>What happened!!</p>, <p>—There will be a change of plans, then.</p>, <p>\"Change of plans?\"</p>, <p>Alexander had enough rationality within him to listen.</p>, <p>\"You are changing the plans?\"</p>, <p>—Find the one who took the role from you. Once you do, send us his information. We'll take care of it for you.</p>, <p>\"You will...?\"</p>, <p>—Yes.</p>, <p>The voice flatly said. A smile finally returned to Alexander. Ah, yes... They can do it. They'll fix it. Good. Good.</p>, <p>\"I'll find him.\"</p>, <p>The itch stopped, and his expression returned to normal.</p>, <p>He was no longer as panicked.</p>, <p>\"....I'll find him immediately.\"</p>, <p>—Do that.</p>, <p>Alexander ended the transmission. He massaged his face, trying his best to fix his expression. Dabbing his neck with his sleeve, he made sure to clean up the blood as well.</p>, <p>Taking out a mirror, he stared at himself.</p>, <p>\"Good.\"</p>, <p>A warm smile, and a friendly expression.</p>, <p>Such was his persona.</p>, <p>\"Yes, this will do.\"</p>, <p>Fixing his clothes, he turned around.</p>, <p>\"Eh...?\"</p>, <p>He had just taken a few steps when a figure appeared not far from him. Immediately, he stood out. With tall and overbearing features, his appearance attracted the attention of all those around him.</p>, <p>With his deep hazel eyes scanning the surroundings, he seemed to be looking for someone.</p>, <p>His head turned left, and then right, and then...</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>They locked onto him.</p>, <p>Alexander was taken aback. The distance between the two shrank until he was eventually a few meters from him.</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>Alexander addressed him with his usual smile while casually glancing at his blazer.</p>, <p>Distinguishing the year of a cadet was made easy by the stripes adorning their blazers. A single stripe denoted a first-year cadet, while two stripes signified a second-year, and the pattern continued accordingly, offering a visual cue to their progression through the academy.</p>, <p>The cadet had one stripe.</p>, <p>He was his junior.</p>, <p>\"How may I help you, junior?\"</p>, <p>By addressing him as Junior, he quickly elevated his position to a higher status than his. He thought his 'junior' would understand, but he didn't as he stared at him without saying a word.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>His intense hazel eyes scanned his body meticulously as if he was looking for something.</p>, <p>The more he looked, the more Alexander grew uncomfortable. For a brief moment, his expression almost cracked and his hands trembled. Alexander found himself imagining himself strangling him.</p>, <p>But he held himself back.</p>, <p>He couldn't show such a display. At least, not yet. There were more important things that he needed to do.</p>, <p>\"Junior...?\"</p>, <p>Alexander called out again. This time, he made his voice sterner. As if he was trying to warn the junior before him.</p>, <p>He seemed to have gotten his message across as the junior finally took his gaze away from him.</p>, <p>Just when Alexander thought he was going to apologize, he asked something that completely took him aback.</p>, <p>\"Did you apply for the position?\"</p>, <p>\"Position?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes. For Azarias.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Alexander frowned. Suddenly, he found his lips become dry. It couldn't be that...</p>, <p>The Junior went on to apply.</p>, <p>\"I also applied.\"</p>, <p>\"....You, did?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>The Junior nodded.</p>, <p>\"A pity he was already selected.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, a pity indeed...\"</p>, <p>\"Then.\"</p>, <p>Lowering his head, the junior excused himself.</p>, <p>\".....I apologize for disturbing you.\"</p>, <p>The apology finally came.</p>, <p>\"You would've made for a great Azarias.\"</p>, <p>As the junior departed, his words hung in the air, leaving Alexender speechless.</p>, <p>Despite the urge to speak up, he found himself at a loss for words, his mouth hanging open.</p>, <p>All he could do was watch as the senior's figure merged into the sea of cadets, gradually fading from view.</p>, <p>For some reason...</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>The itch started again.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'....It's probably him.'</p>, <p>I wasn't quite sure just yet. It all happened rather fast. I was overlooking the cadet selection for the incoming roles, when...</p>, <p>[ ◆ Side Quest Activated : Final Act.]</p>, <p>: Character Progression + 39%</p>, <p>: Game Progression + 6%</p>, <p>Failure</p>, <p>: Calamity 1 + 12%</p>, <p>A familiar notification popped up in my vision.</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>It wasn't as if I wasn't expecting it. No, rather I was expecting it to happen. Given how big of an event the festival was, I doubted nothing would've happened.</p>, <p>Without a doubt, something was going to happen. I was proven right.</p>, <p>'It looks like the target is Aoife.'</p>, <p>Calamity 1 was Aoife. That much became clear to me after the prison incident.</p>, <p>\"....She also got selected for the role in the play.\"</p>, <p>The girl that I was supposed to kill. It was a funny thought. What sort of face was she going to make when she realized I was the one who was supposed to kill her?</p>, <p>But that was outside of the point.</p>, <p>No vision accompanied the notification. However, I didn't feel like I needed it this time.</p>, <p>I knew that I couldn't rely on the visions to appear all the time and that I had to figure things out myself sometimes.</p>, <p>Good thing I did.</p>, <p>'I've already found my target.'</p>, <p>Or at least, was more or less confident in my selection.</p>, <p>The event was titled 'Final Act' suggesting that it had something to do with the play. Aoife's selection in the play further reaffirmed my thoughts.</p>, <p>I put myself in the shoes of the organization.</p>, <p>They were strong. Incredibly powerful. However, if they wanted to target Aoife during the play, the most realistic approach wouldn't be through some mass attack during the play.</p>, <p>Let alone the fact that all the big shots were going to be present, but even getting into the Academy was going to be hard.</p>, <p>The only conclusion that I thought was feasible was through either an established guest or a performer.</p>, <p>I wasn't sure if they knew whether Aoife would be selected for the role, but if they knew, then... The most perfect candidate would be a performer.</p>, <p>.....And if there was a character who fit the description the best, then it had to be Azarias.</p>, <p>The character that I was playing.</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>It was all speculative.</p>, <p>There was no clear evidence for my thoughts. Or at least, not until I observed all the male candidates for the role and spotted a certain someone behaving differently from the others.</p>, <p>It was for that reason that I approached him.</p>, <p>As expected, it might be him.</p>, <p>The more I thought about my interaction with him, the more convinced I was.</p>, <p>\"Not yet.\"</p>, <p>Even so, I didn't act just yet.</p>, <p>Now was not the right time. Not only did I not know how strong he was, but we were in the Academy. It wasn't as if I could do anything to him even if I wanted to.</p>, <p>That would be stupid.</p>, <p>Not only that but if something were to happen to him, then the people behind him could very well change their plans.</p>, <p>Things would become unpredictable then.</p>, <p>I didn't like unpredictability. I liked for things to remain predictable. Only then would I have a certain sense of control over the situation.</p>, <p>For now, I needed to maintain this status quo.</p>, <p>At the very least, until I found an opening.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Thursday. A few days before the festival.</p>, <p>I sat on one of the benches around the campus, waiting for someone. I checked the time. It was just about 3 P.M.</p>, <p>I couldn't stay here for long. I had a place to be in a few hours.</p>, <p>Thankfully, I didn't have to wait for long.</p>, <p>He appeared not long after.</p>, <p>\"You came.\"</p>, <p>Wearing the same academy uniform as I did, Leon greeted me with a flat look.</p>, <p>\"Did you expect me to ignore your message?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>His lack of reply was all that I needed to hear. So he did...</p>, <p>\"What do you see me as?\"</p>, <p>This time, I could see a reaction from him. Disgust? And... A little bit of fear?</p>, <p>\"What...\"</p>, <p>\"No, stop.\"</p>, <p>He held his hand in front of me.</p>, <p>\"I come in peace.\"</p>, <p>The fuck is this guy on about? In peace? In peace from what?</p>, <p>\"....I need your help.\"</p>, <p>An unexpected set of words came out of his mouth and I frowned.</p>, <p>\"You want my help?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>He quietly nodded his head as he sat down on the opposite end of the bench. He was behaving quite strangely today.</p>, <p>\"What do you want me to help you with?\"</p>, <p>\".....You wrote this, right?\"</p>, <p>Extending his hand, he passed me a familiar piece of paper. I took a casual glance before understanding his intentions.</p>, <p>\"Wrong person to ask. I'm no-\"</p>, <p>\"I'll teach you.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Surprised, I looked at him.</p>, <p>Teach me?</p>, <p>\"Why would you....?\"</p>, <p>\"I think you're talented.\"</p>, <p>\"Talented?\"</p>, <p>I almost laughed. This guy... He had really lost his mind. I was just about to stand up and leave when he held me down.</p>, <p>\"I'm serious.\"</p>, <p> I took a good moment to stare at his face. I was really having a hard time taking him seriously, but looking at his expression which seemed absolutely serious, I had no choice but to sit back down.</p>, <p>\"So you think I'm talented?\"</p>, <p>\"I do.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Perhaps because he had been with me since the start and had seen my progress, he thought that I was talented. But what did he know?</p>, <p>He knew nothing about the struggles that I had to go through to just barely reach an acceptable level.</p>, <p>I was still levels behind this guy, and our gap was only widening.</p>, <p>If there was one truly talented person, then it had to be him.</p>, <p>I still decided to hear him out.</p>, <p>\"Let's say that I'm talented. What does that have to do with you wanting to teach me?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Leon pursed his lips and briefly looked down. Falling into his own thoughts, he only looked back after a short while.</p>, <p>\"I've reached a bottleneck.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>\"It's just like you said. I've been trying my best to fix the missing parts that are within the art that I'm practicing. I've spent the past two years trying to fix the problem. I thought I had done a good job at hiding the fact that the technique was incomplete, but...\"</p>, <p>He paused there, but his meaning was clear.</p>, <p>\"You think I'll be able to think of a way to fix it?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>He didn't respond, but his expression yet again told me everything that I needed to know.</p>, <p>Haa. This time, I really wanted to laugh. This guy has totally lost his marbles.</p>, <p>\"I'm not expecting you to pay me back or anything. I am willing to teach you the technique for free. If you can't perfect it, then that's fine too. I won't blame you for it.\"</p>, <p>I massaged my forehead.</p>, <p>My head was throbbing.</p>, <p>Of all the people he could've asked, he asked me...</p>, <p>'This is stupid.'</p>, <p>There had to be some sort of intention behind his actions. I refused to believe it was just because he thought I could complete it.</p>, <p>\".....Fine.\"</p>, <p>Despite all the doubts that I had, I still accepted the offer.</p>, <p>It went without saying that I accepted. It was simply an extremely advantageous deal for me.</p>, <p>The only problem that I had with this offer was the fact that I truly didn't understand where this guy was coming from.</p>, <p>Could I truly trust him....?</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I looked at his face.</p>, <p>It looked stupid.</p>, <p>As if perhaps sensing my thoughts, Leon frowned.</p>, <p>\"What are you thinking about?\"</p>, <p>I was taken aback.</p>, <p>\"What are you?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>'So he really did read my mind.\"</p>, <p>\"Your face looks stupid.\"</p>, <p>Oh, shit.</p>, <p>I covered my mouth.</p>, <p>\"I wasn't meant to say it out loud.\"</p>, <p>My true thoughts had slipped.</p>, <p>Leon blinked, and just faintly, his stoic expression cracked. I closely observed his expression. Was it going to crack...?</p>, <p>The answer was no.</p>, <p>With a sigh, he slowly got up from the chair.</p>, <p>\"I'll slowly start teaching you the art when we have time. I'll take my leave now.\"</p>, <p>With a slight bow, he was prepared to leave. I looked at his back which was now facing me, before opening my mouth to say a name,</p>, <p>\"Alexander Harrington.\"</p>, <p>His steps halted.</p>, <p>I continued.</p>, <p>\".....Pay attention to him.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'Alexander Harrington.'</p>, <p>Even as he distanced himself from Julien, the name continued to ring in his mind. He had asked for clarification, but all he was met with was a simple,'Keep an eye out for me.' before he left.</p>, <p>The name didn't ring a bell, and regardless of how hard he tried, he couldn't recall such a name.</p>, <p>Still, he was planning on finding out.</p>, <p>In any case, the talk went better than expected.</p>, <p>'He accepted.'</p>, <p>Quite honestly, Leon didn't hold a lot of expectations in his attempt at trying to solve the puzzle that had been plaguing him for the past few years.</p>, <p>However, he had grown to a point where he was starting to become desperate.</p>, <p>To the point where he even thought of teaching Julien his technique so that he could help him find an answer.</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>Leon found himself blankly staring at the sky.</p>, <p>The bottleneck.</p>, <p>It had appeared the moment he reached Tier 3.</p>, <p>The bottleneck wasn't yet apparent. It was faint, but Leon could feel it.</p>, <p>Were he to continue down this path, he was sure that by the time he reached Tier 5 and higher, his growth would completely stagnate.</p>, <p>The fact that Julien had managed to pick up the flaw within just a few hours of observation was enough for Leon to understand something.</p>, <p>'He's talented.'</p>, <p>Perhaps he himself hadn't noticed, but Leon certainly saw it. If he were to train a little further, then...</p>, <p>\"It's worth the shot.\"</p>, <p>Plus, it wasn't like he was going to teach him the entire thing.</p>, <p>Just the movement art which was what he needed.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Leon suddenly frowned as he thought back to something.</p>, <p>The more he thought about it, the more annoyed he became. He tried to ignore it, but the words would just continue to nag at the back of his mind.</p>, <p>To the point where he found himself stopping a nearby cadet.</p>, <p>\"Hey, you...\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah yeah? Me?\"</p>, <p>The cadet pointed at himself with a flustered look.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded with a serious face.</p>, <p>Then, pointing at himself, he asked,</p>, <p>\"...Does my face look stupid?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Today was the first day of practice.</p>, <p>There were only a few days left before the festival was in full swing, and Aoife had spent the last couple of days seriously practicing her lines.</p>, <p>There weren't many. Just a couple, but she had to perfectly display fear and terror in her expression.</p>, <p>From the tremble of her eyes to the pitch of her voice.</p>, <p>Everything had to be perfect.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Setting the script down, Aoife took a deep breath.</p>, <p>She was currently inside a small practice room by herself.</p>, <p>Soon she was going to meet the man who was supposed to play Azarias. Today was the first time she was going to meet him. Not only that, but she was also going to meet the other actors in the play.</p>, <p>Today was their first reading.</p>, <p>An event where all the actors of the play would meet to familiarize themselves with each other.</p>, <p>There was an undeniable excitement around the rookie actor.</p>, <p>Rumors had it that he had been selected the moment that he had gone to the audition.</p>, <p>With a godly level of acting, the writer chose him on the spot.</p>, <p>'I'm curious.'</p>, <p>But at the same time, Aoife was also nervous.</p>, <p>Would she even be able to keep up with such an actor?</p>, <p>The mere thought of performing with someone like that made her nervous. If it somehow ended up ruining the play, then...</p>, <p>\"Let's not think about it.\"</p>, <p>Aoife became increasingly nervous the more she thought about it. Right, who knows, maybe I'll be able to hold my own.</p>, <p>Gradually, her mind started to calm down and she felt less stressed.</p>, <p>\"Alright.\"</p>, <p>She slapped her cheeks and stood proudly.</p>, <p>\"....I've got this.\"</p>, <p>Collecting herself, she reached for the door and opened it.</p>, <p>\"Is everything ready?\"</p>, <p>\"Do you have the script with you?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes, I've got it right here. Please wait a moment. I'll distribute them to the tables.\"</p>, <p>Aoife was immediately greeted with chaos. The reading was set to take place in several minutes, and the staff was busy getting everything ready for the actors and actresses who were going to take part in the play.</p>, <p>The venue wasn't particularly spacious, roughly half the size of the auditorium. Originally designated for storage purposes, its discreet location made it an ideal choice for hosting the reading, given the secretive nature of the script.</p>, <p>Walking around, Aoife managed to catch a glimpse of several famous actors.</p>, <p>As expected, there was a certain aura about them that stood out from the rest. You could tell at a glance that they were the best of the best.</p>, <p>But it wasn't as though her own aura lacked compared to theirs.</p>, <p>Rather, it shined just as brightly, instantly attracting the attention of the actors present.</p>, <p>\"Haha, if it isn't our rising superstar.\"</p>, <p>Aoife was greeted by a tall and strikingly handsome man who introduced himself as Darius Johns, the main lead of the play.</p>, <p>He greeted her with a large smile.</p>, <p>\"Are you nervous? Haha, you don't have to be. With me her-\"</p>, <p>Aoife was about to respond when she was pulled back.</p>, <p>A crisp voice echoed right after.</p>, <p>\"Get your hands off of her. The gap between you two is too large.\"</p>, <p>\"No, I-\"</p>, <p>\"No!\"</p>, <p>Before Aoife knew it, she was surrounded by the main cast of the play.</p>, <p>\"Stay away from our little rookie, Darius.\"</p>, <p>\"Don't you know who you're talking to?\"</p>, <p>Everyone started to berate him, as he flusteredly looked around.</p>, <p>\"No, I was just trying to be friendly...\"</p>, <p>\"Bullcrap!\"</p>, <p>\"How are you holding up?\"</p>, <p>While this was going on, Aoife was greeted by a stunning woman, whose presence momentarily caught her off guard.</p>, <p>\"Have you memorized your lines? If you need help feel free to ask us.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Despite her efforts to maintain composure, Aoife couldn't help but feel a flutter of excitement at the sight of Odette Ripley, a renowned actress whose performances she had admired in countless recordings and plays.</p>, <p>Aoife was a huge fan of her works, and seeing her in person almost made her squeal.</p>, <p>\"Odette, let her go. Can't you see she's uncomfortable with your touch?\"</p>, <p>\"No, she isn't.\"</p>, <p>Odette turned to look at Aoife.</p>, <p>\"You aren't, right?\"</p>, <p>\"....No.\"</p>, <p>\"Ha, see?\"</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>There was an overall pleasant atmosphere around the place. With all actors familiar with one another, the mood was serene.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right, do you know who's the actor that forced that woman to change the script?\"</p>, <p>At Odette's sudden question, the atmosphere changed a little.</p>, <p>Aoife titled her head. The topic interested her as well.</p>, <p>\"I don't know to be honest. That woman refuses to say anything. I've begged her so many times, but she just doesn't budge at all.\"</p>, <p>\"Right, the same is true for me.\"</p>, <p>\"....But is he actually good? I mean, I get that he managed to get that woman to change the script, but could it have been some fluke?\"</p>, <p>\"No, impossible. You know how that woman is. There's no way she would do what she did unless she was confident.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes... I guess. Well, we'll see during the reading. Whether they are truly as good as they say.\"</p>, <p>The conversation continued in that direction. Aoife listened quietly from the side, occasionally adding her own thoughts on the matter.</p>, <p>That was until someone announced,</p>, <p>\"The reading is about to start. May all the actors get seated.\"</p>, <p>\"Eh? Already?\"</p>, <p>\"That's fast.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm? But where is the rookie actor everyone is talking about?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, he's here.\"</p>, <p>As the assistant spoke, the door swung open, and a figure walked it. Almost everyone turned their face in the direction of the door.</p>, <p>Aoife was one such person. She was curious. Just who was this super rookie?</p>, <p>Only that...</p>, <p>\"No, it can't be.\"</p>, <p>Her expectations were shattered the moment he entered as she blinked several times to make sure she wasn't seeing wrongly.</p>, <p>Blinking again, and seeing the same figure standing before her with what seemed to be a slight curl of his lips, Aoife swallowed.</p>, <p>\"Oh, no...\"</p>, <p>The godly actor who had taken the show by storm. The person whom she had to try her best to keep up with, and the person that she was supposed to treat like a master...</p>, <p>\"Ah, no...\"</p>, <p>It was none other than Julien.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>He immediately grabbed the attention of the room with his presence. With looks that put even the best-looking actor to shame, he became the focal point of everyone's gaze.</p>, <p>Behind him, a familiar figure appeared.</p>, <p>She was following him with gleaming eyes.</p>, <p>\"There's no need to feel too pressured. Just act as you've done last time, and-Oh, it looks like everyone is here. Sorry for the delay, I was talking with him about something.\"</p>, <p>It was none other than Olga who waved her hand at the actors sitting across the room.</p>, <p>\"Writer, it's a pleasure to see you.\"</p>, <p>\"Hello.\"</p>, <p>Snapping out of it, the actors went on to greet her.</p>, <p>There was a certain respect in their voice as they talked to her. And rightfully so. Her name resounded throughout the entire Empire, and while all the actors present had a certain fame to their name, it was meaningless when compared to Olga.</p>, <p>\"It's nice to see you all again. I apologize in advance for the delay and change in script.\"</p>, <p>\"No worries, no worries… it's indeed better. I'm sure it'll be a hit.\"</p>, <p>Compliments began to flow effortlessly from the actor's lips, each one more lavish than the last, until inevitably, the spotlight of attention gradually shifted towards Julien.</p>, <p>\"Haha, are you the actor everyone is talking about?\"</p>, <p>Darius, true to his nature, was the first to approach Julien with his trademark warmth, extending a friendly greeting in his usual amiable manner.</p>, <p>\"You might know me, but I'm Darius.\"</p>, <p>He held out his hand.</p>, <p>But…</p>, <p>\"….\"</p>, <p>All he received in response was a blank stare. It was obvious from Julien's gaze that he had no idea as to who he was.</p>, <p>And he was right.</p>, <p>Julien really didn't know who the person in front of him was.</p>, <p>'Famous actor…? Who?'</p>, <p>Most probably seemed to be the case. He was just about to hold his hand up to return the greeting when Olga intervened.</p>, <p>\"Enough with the greetings. Let's just straight to the reading. I can't wait.\"</p>, <p>And thus, Julien was never able to return the greetings.</p>, <p>Whispers started to spread.</p>, <p>\"Wow, did you see that? He totally ignored Darius.\"</p>, <p>\"That's the godly actor that made her change the script?\"</p>, <p>\"Well, he certainly has the looks for it.\"</p>, <p>\"….But doesn't he seem rather plain? No, not his looks. But his expression. It's as blank as a piece of paper.\"</p>, <p>\"From the way he was acting, it seems like he's looking down on everyone.\"</p>, <p>\"No, that's not the case...\"</p>, <p>Aoife muttered to herself from the side.</p>, <p>\"He's just like that.\"</p>, <p>It wasn't a scene she was used to seeing. She could practically count the many times she had seen a similar scene over the past few months.</p>, <p> '….Does this guy not care about anything else but himself?'</p>, <p>As if sensing her gaze, he turned to look at her and their gazes met.</p>, <p>'What is…'</p>, <p>For the briefest of moments, Aoife noticed a subtle curl at the corner of his lips.</p>, <p>It disappeared as fast as it came, and the writer clapped her hands to get everyone's attention.</p>, <p>\"We will skip the introductions for now. Let's start the reading.\"</p>, <p>Soon, the large hall, which had become somewhat awkward due to Julien, was plunged into a state of silence.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>Only for it to be shattered by the sound of pages turning. As heads turned in unison, all eyes fell upon Julien, who sat quietly, his gaze fixed on the script before him.</p>, <p>Everyone wore a strange expression as they looked at him. He really… didn't care at all about what others thought of him.</p>, <p>More whispers ensued.</p>, <p>\"Doesn't he seem nervous? Like, he's quite stiff. This isn't a good sign.\"</p>, <p>\"Could just be his personality...?\"</p>, <p>\"I'm not sure. I was looking forward to seeing the godly rookie that forced Olga to change the script, but maybe we won't see it today?\"</p>, <p>\"What happens if he sucks?\"</p>, <p>\"....I doubt he will. And if he does, we can just go back to the old script.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, I see.\"</p>, <p>At this moment, while the actors were conversing with each other, Olga stood up and said,</p>, <p>\"Let's begin. Act 1. The Bakery.\"</p>, <p>The story was set in a similar time to their own, focusing on a young man raised in an orphanage who became ensnared in the intricate schemes of the royal family as a result of his job. A detective.</p>, <p>But there was a secret he had. He had a special power. One that allowed him to retrace crime scenes to see what had happened.</p>, <p>In the first scene, the main character 'Joseph' played by Darius visits a bakery.</p>, <p>\"Uh... This is where she worked, is that correct?\"</p>, <p>It was an introductory scene to the main character. It had to be said, that Darius was a great actor. The moment his scene started, he was able to quickly get into character.</p>, <p>Outwardly, he had an air of laziness, yet an underlying seriousness underscored his demeanor, leaving no doubt about his commitment to solving the crime.</p>, <p>Such was Joseph, the character he was playing.</p>, <p>Darius was doing a great job at embodying such a character.</p>, <p>\"Yes, this is the bakery.\"</p>, <p>Another actor, his assistant in the play, commented from the side.</p>, <p>The scene continued.</p>, <p>\"Emily Stein.\"</p>, <p>The assistant mused, his tone turning somber.</p>, <p>\"The owner's daughter. According to the details, she seems to have vanished sometime yesterday.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, uh, yeah... I see.\"</p>, <p>With a subtle nod, Darius surveyed the surroundings, idly tracing his finger along the surface of the wooden table they were seated at. With a lazy expression on his face, his actions were merely to make it look as though he was doing something.</p>, <p>The assistant looked around before muttering,</p>, <p>\"There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the place. The crime likely occurred outside of the bakery. Should we...\"</p>, <p>\"Give me a second.\"</p>, <p>Darius closed his eyes, and..</p>, <p>Clap—!</p>, <p>\"End of Act 1.\"</p>, <p>The scene cut.</p>, <p>Supposedly, the scene was supposed to cut to a vision.</p>, <p>Aoife observed from the side with admiration that she didn't show.</p>, <p>'As expected, seeing them in person is something else...'</p>, <p>She felt shivers.</p>, <p>But apparently, she was the only one that felt this way. Olga, the writer of the play, frowned and addressed the assistant.</p>, <p>\"Ronan, did you read the script properly? Your lines were bland. I need you to be sterner just like in the script.\"</p>, <p>Olga sighed.</p>, <p>\"The two of you are contrasting characters. One is lazy, and the other one is stern. I don't feel any of that from the lines. Change your tone. Make your voice deeper.\"</p>, <p>\".....I apologize, I will do better.\"</p>, <p>Olga then went on to comment on a few other things that she disliked. Overall, even Darius wasn't spared from criticism.</p>, <p>This went on for several minutes until Olga sighed and set back down.</p>, <p>\"Next scene. Act 2. The vision.\"</p>, <p>Her brows trembled, and her attention shifted towards Julien.</p>, <p>It was Juliens' first appearance.</p>, <p>But not just his. Aoife's as well.</p>, <p>\"This is the more detailed version of the scene from the tryouts. Please don't feel too pressured. I just want to see how you'd do in this scene.\"</p>, <p>Her attention soon turned to Aoife.</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>Frowning, Olga seemed to want to say something, but decided against it and quietly said,</p>, <p>\".....Just try to keep up.\"</p>, <p>\"Eh?\"</p>, <p>Stunned, Aoife didn't know how to respond. Just try to keep up? What did that even mean? Slowly, her fists clenched together as she lowered her head to stare at her script.</p>, <p>It was only a few pages long but it was filled with creases and notes.</p>, <p>For the past week, she had dedicated countless hours to dissecting the role, sacrificing sleep and analyzing numerous plays in an effort to perfect her tone and expressions.</p>, <p>Now, as she gazed at the script, its worn pages barely holding together, Aoife bit her lips and looked up.</p>, <p>Her competitive spirit ignited.</p>, <p>'Let's see if I really need to keep up.'</p>, <p>\"Start.\"</p>, <p>Compared to the first script, the scene was different. The occurrences no longer occurred in a room, but rather in the open.</p>, <p>\"Hah, man~\"</p>, <p>Aoife was the first one to speak. Her tone sounded light and crisp. The expressions of many of the actors present changed.</p>, <p>They clearly did not expect her acting to be like that.</p>, <p>\"....I can't believe this shop is closed as well.\"</p>, <p>In the setting, Aoife, or Emily, was visiting the nearby shops to buy missing pieces for their malfunctioning mixer. It was a matter of utter importance since the bakery couldn't run without the machinery.</p>, <p>It was late into the night, and all shops were closed.</p>, <p>In her desperation, Emily found a man in the streets for help.</p>, <p>\"Ah, excuse me! Do you perhaps know if any shops are still open where I can buy some parts for a broken mixer?\"</p>, <p>That man...</p>, <p>Was none other than Azarias.</p>, <p>With his head lowered, Julien slowly raised his head. He didn't immediately turn into character. At first, his expression was blank.</p>, <p>Aoife stared at it unblinkingly.</p>, <p>Almost as if she was trying to challenge him.</p>, <p>'Come, show me... Show me what you've got...'</p>, <p>All eyes were on Julien whose expression remained blank the entire time. Everyone wore similar expressions as they wandered about him and his acting. Was it really going to be as good as Olga suggested? Was it just a fluke? Overrated?</p>, <p>The thoughts ran through their mind until they didn't.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Finally, Julien's expression changed and so did his aura. It was as if a different person had taken over.</p>, <p>It indeed was.</p>, <p>Right now, Julien was mixing a few characters in his mind. From the memories of William's madness to the emotions he felt right after he first killed a person.</p>, <p>He solely focused on those experiences and emotions.</p>, <p>In doing so, his entire demenour changed and he became a completely different person. It was a chilling sight that took Aoife's breath away.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, the world around her seemed to have changed.</p>, <p>No longer did it feel like she was in the reading room. As of right now, she truly felt like Emily.</p>, <p>\".... You're looking for a replacement?\"</p>, <p>Julien's voice came out dry. However, within the dryness of the voice was a smile. A gentle, and warm smile.</p>, <p>Aoife felt a strange discomfort staring into that smile.</p>, <p>It made her fidgety.</p>, <p>Even so, she had to resist the urge to show it. In the play, Emily, desperate for the missing piece doesn't notice such things.</p>, <p>And so...</p>, <p>\"Yes, I am.\"</p>, <p>\"I know, yes... I know of a place.\"</p>, <p>\"You do...?!\"</p>, <p>\"Yes, please go straight. If you just keep going there, you can find it.\"</p>, <p>\"Thank you so much!\"</p>, <p>It was a short interaction. One that ended with her thanking the man before leaving.</p>, <p>Aoife did her best to keep her tone even. Even so, just briefly, her voice trembled. Aoife half-expected the writer to call her out for it, but nobody said a thing.</p>, <p>And how could they?</p>, <p>'Shivers... I'm feeling shivers... From the many expressions he manages to reveal through his eyes alone and subtle gestures, this is even better than what I saw last time.'</p>, <p>Olga found herself once again doubting her own writing abilities. She felt as if she had still not done the character justice.</p>, <p>The other actors were no exception.</p>, <p>'It's no wonder he acted like that. He truly is... Scary.'</p>, <p>'How can anyone act like that? It feels like I'm being sucked right into the scene.'</p>, <p>'I'm getting shivers.'</p>, <p>Julien lowered his head. He scanned the room that was filled with other actors. He was meant to stare just straight. Where Emily's departing back was, but as if he wasn't satisfied with that, he stared at everyone present.</p>, <p>His eyes changed.</p>, <p>Julien, no Azarias's gaze turned intense. A smile slowly crept across his features and his body started to tremble. His eyes changed further, his pupils slowly dilating.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa..\"</p>, <p>His breath echoed in rhythm, each exhale tinged with excitement.</p>, <p>He was thrilled.</p>, <p>Adrenaline surged through his veins, engulfing him completely.</p>, <p>\"R-red...\"</p>, <p>He quietly mumbled.</p>, <p>\"....I want to see it.\"</p>, <p>At this point, Aoife had long stopped acting. Staring at the warn-out script in her hand, she leaned back on her chair and blankly stared at Julien.</p>, <p>\"How?\"</p>, <p>How am I supposed to compete with this?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Aoife had a hard time adjusting to what she was seeing.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>At first, she thought that the gap between them wouldn't be at all that big. That maybe, the rumors about the 'godly actor' were a bit of an exaggeration and it was all done for the publicity of the play.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>'How am I supposed to compete with this? And this is just a script reading...'</p>, <p>Her grip on her script tightened.</p>, <p>She felt a sense of frustration well up deep within her.</p>, <p>Yet again, she...</p>, <p>\"This is...\"</p>, <p>Aoife wasn't the only one that felt that way. Even the more senior actors felt at a loss for words with his performance. This was especially so for Odette and Darius who remained silent the entire time.</p>, <p>The way they looked at him changed. It went from, 'Can he do it?' to 'Can I keep up?'

Getting into that state of mind was rather tough. However, looking around and seeing the silent looks that everyone was giving me, I felt like I had done a decent job.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The room was silent with everyone glancing at each other with weird expressions.</p>, <p>It went on for long enough to make me frown.</p>, <p>What happened?</p>, <p>Was it possible that I had messed up somewhere?</p>, <p>\".....That was great.\"</p>, <p>Just as I started to doubt myself, the writer spoke as her voice shattered the silence that gripped the surroundings. I sighed in relief then.</p>, <p>\"Brilliant, yeah.\"</p>, <p> \"That was amazing.\"</p>, <p>\"Wow, I got shivers. You were amazing.\"</p>, <p>Praise started to flow out of the mouths of all actors present. I took them in without much of a change in expression. Gradually, my gaze fell on a distant figure who was staring at her script with a deep frown.</p>, <p>As if sensing my gaze, our eyes met and I raised my brow in a manner that suggested, 'Are you not going to praise me as well?'</p>, <p>Her expression cracked, and her lips twitched.</p>, <p>'Oh, no.'</p>, <p>I was doing it again.</p>, <p>\"Everyone, please be quiet.\"</p>, <p>Clap—!</p>, <p>A clap broke the atmosphere as the writer directed all attention towards herself.</p>, <p>\"Let's save the praises for later. We still have a few scenes to go through. At this rate, we won't be able to finish on time.\"</p>, <p>Only then did the atmosphere finally calm down and the reading continued.</p>, <p>\"Act 3. End of the Vision.\"</p>, <p>The script reading continued in its usual fashion. It had to be said that all people present were fantastic actors. It took everything that I had to stop myself from showing awe and amazement at what I was seeing.</p>, <p>Especially the two main leading actors. Their acting... It was phenomenal. Even better than some of the best actors I had seen back on earth.</p>, <p>'....I wish he'd have seen this with me.'</p>, <p>He would've probably been the first person to jump up from excitement.</p>, <p>My brother Noel.</p>, <p>\"Act 7. A colorless world.\"</p>, <p>Suddenly, an act was called up and all the attention focused on me again.</p>, <p>'Ah, yeah.'</p>, <p>I looked at the script with a blank look. Act 7. That was Azarias's last act. After all that had happened, Joseph, the main character finally takes him down, ending his serial rampaging.</p>, <p>It was supposed to be an easy scene.</p>, <p>But that had completely changed after the rewrite.</p>, <p>'Even now, I...'</p>, <p>\".....Julien?\"</p>, <p>Hearing my name called up, I looked up. Everyone was staring at me. I could see the anticipation in their gazes as they looked at me. Their expressions... I could read them like an open book.</p>, <p>'What sort of acting is he going to show?' 'I can't wait to see him act this part.'</p>, <p>'I'm getting shivers just thinking about it.'</p>, <p>They felt burdensome.</p>, <p>But it was truly unfortunate. Staring at the script in front of me, I silently sighed and closed it before placing it on the desk.</p>, <p>\"I apologize.\"</p>, <p>I silently stood up under everyone's stunned expressions.</p>, <p>\"...I can't do it.\"</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>In a remote area within the Academy Campus.</p>, <p>\"I've found his name.\"</p>, <p>Alexander stood with a communication orb in his hand. News of Julien's appearance as an extra and the 'godly actor' that had persuaded the writer to change the script had started to spread.</p>, <p>It was only for a brief moment given that the reading had only shortly ended, but finally, the identity of the mysterious 'cadet' had been revealed.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that Alexander had managed to find his identity.</p>, <p>Otherwise, he would've had to spend a lot more time to find the identity. Given how secretive the collective had been about the new script, the identity of the cadet had been kept a secret until now.</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>That was the name of the cadet who forced 'Olga' to change the script.</p>, <p>\"Thief...\"</p>, <p>Silently muttering under his breath, Alexander connected the communication orb.</p>, <p>A familiar voice reached out from it.</p>, <p>—I've received the news.</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes... You must've.\"</p>, <p>Indeed.</p>, <p>\"And?\"</p>, <p>Alexander listened with bathed breath. Were they going to do something about it? Perhaps kill him? But he was an important figure... Killing him would be a bit of trouble. He could do it if they allowed him.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>—We are holding the operation for now.</p>, <p>The answer he received was an unexpected one.</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Scratch.</p>, <p>\"That...\"</p>, <p>He found himself unable to utter a single word. They just refused to leave his lips.</p>, <p>\"I heard wrong?\"</p>, <p>Yes, it had to be that. Yes...</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>—We will be the ones to take care of the matter. For now, sit back and wait for me to contact you again.</p>, <p>\"Uh, but... Ah!\"</p>, <p>The communication ended there.</p>, <p>\"No, this...\"</p>, <p>And the itching started.</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch—!</p>, <p>It just wouldn't stop. Even as he felt blood drip down from the side of his neck, the itching didn't stop. He continued to scratch, silently biting his lips in the process.</p>, <p>\"No, this... It makes no sense. How? What happened? Why?\"</p>, <p>Pacing around, Alexander bit onto his nail.</p>, <p>Long gone was his warm appearance. What replaced it was a twisted look filled with madness.</p>, <p>\"I can't... I must... I need to perform. I need to. Have to.\"</p>, <p>Gradually, his steps stopped.</p>, <p>\"....Yes, I don't need to care.\"</p>, <p>In the first place, he had no desire to live. His only goal was to put on the best performance he possibly could. He cared nothing for them.</p>, <p>What made them think they could stop him?</p>, <p>\"Stop me. Can't.\"</p>, <p>He made up his mind then.</p>, <p>\"I'll perform.\"</p>, <p>Whether they liked it or not, he was going to do it.</p>, <p>That much was clear.</p>, <p>Scratch, scraaach...</p>, <p>Finally, the itch stopped and he took a deep breath. Taking out a small bottle, he placed it over his neck as his injuries started to heal at a rapid pace.</p>, <p>Massaging his face, his expression returned to its normal one. Then, nonchalantly looking around, he proceeded to leave the premises.</p>, <p>Only that...</p>, <p>Even as he left, he didn't notice that presence that stood not far from him.</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>At the same time.</p>, <p>\"Huuu. Huuu...!\"</p>, <p>Taking deep breaths, I practiced the blue-ranked manual. The mana inside of my body started to expand at a constant pace. It was slower than before, but the progress was still there.</p>, <p>I took deep and silent breaths while focusing on controlling my mana.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>Sweat gradually started to pour down from my body as I immersed myself in training. Or at least, for the first ten minutes of it.</p>, <p>A nagging thought persisted at the back of my mind, preventing me from fully immersing myself in the experience.</p>, <p>\"....Haaa.\"</p>, <p>My eyes opened and I took a deep breath.</p>, <p>\"I can't focus.\"</p>, <p>Turning my head, my eyes fell on the script that rested a few meters away from me. The events from before replayed in my mind.</p>, <p>Having left the script reading early, I went back to my dorm and resumed my training.</p>, <p>It was unfortunate, but I had no choice but to leave.</p>, <p>The last part of the script...</p>, <p>I couldn't do it.</p>, <p>Regardless of how many times I tried to envision myself in that scenario, my mind would just blank out.</p>, <p>I was simply... Not able to replicate what the character, Azarias felt during his last moments. It was too much for me.</p>, <p>I thought that in the week that I received the script, I'd be able to think of something, but nothing. My mind was just blank.</p>, <p>The more I tried to immerse myself in the role, the harder it became for me to visualize myself in it.</p>, <p>\"How troublesome.\"</p>, <p>\"What is?\"</p>, <p>A voice suddenly echoed not far from where I was. Surprised, I turned my head to see Leon sitting on one of my sofas.</p>, <p>As usual, he wore a stoic expression.</p>, <p>\"When did you get here?\"</p>, <p>\"A few minutes ago.\"</p>, <p>A few minutes ago?</p>, <p>\"Couldn't you have knocked?\"</p>, <p>\"I could've.\"</p>, <p>\"And...?\"</p>, <p>\"I have a stupid face, so...\"</p>, <p>I raised my brow. So he was still hung up about that.</p>, <p>I nodded.</p>, <p>\"That's fair.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Seeing that he was refusing to speak, I took a towel and wiped my forehead. I more or less understood why he was here.</p>, <p>\"You've been investigating him, haven't you?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"What did you find?\"</p>, <p>I sat on the opposite end of the sofa and leaned back. Despite his lack of words, I knew that he had something for me.</p>, <p>I was proven right moments after as he finally opened his mouth to speak.</p>, <p>\"He's planning on doing something during the play.\"</p>, <p>\"Figured that much.\"</p>, <p>\"....His target, it seems to be Aoife.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Knew that too.</p>, <p>\"You don't seem to be that surprised?\"</p>, <p>I looked at him flatly.</p>, <p>\"I could more or less tell.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded before suddenly adding,</p>, <p>\"He's not working alone. I wasn't able to hear much, but he was talking to someone with a communication device. I believe there's someone behind him.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Yeah, knew that too.</p>, <p>So far, there was nothing that surprised me. It more or less went the same way that I predicted it would.</p>, <p>Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"There was something odd about the situation. Even though I didn't try to get near him for fear of getting exposed, I did manage to overhear a little bit of their conversation. Something about them taking matters into their own hands.\"</p>, <p>\"....Ah.\"</p>, <p>Now that was a new piece of information. It took a few moments for me to understand what was going on.</p>, <p>'They're coming for me.'</p>, <p>Why else would they suddenly change their plans?</p>, <p>\".....What are you going to do?\"</p>, <p>At Leon's question, I pondered for a moment before asking,</p>, <p>\"How strong is he? Or... How strong do you think he is?\"</p>, <p>Frowning slightly, Leon responded after a few seconds of thought.</p>, <p>\"He's about my strength. Tier 3.\"</p>, <p>\"Do you think you'll be able to handle him?\"</p>, <p>\".....Are you asking me to kill him.\"</p>, <p>\"No, not yet.\"</p>, <p>As I had said before, killing him now wasn't going to do us any good. Rather, it was probably going to put me in a difficult spot.</p>, <p>\"So?\"</p>, <p>Envisioning how things would play out, I shared my thoughts.</p>, <p>\"During the play. He'll try something. His target will probably be me. His goal is probably to take over my position as Azarias. That's the time when we can act.\"</p>, <p>I said 'we' because I wasn't confident I'd be able to take care of him by myself. Thankfully, Leon seemed keen on helping on this matter as he quietly nodded his head.</p>, <p>\"That sounds reasonable. But what about the ones behind him? I'm sure they'll try something. If that's the case then-\"</p>, <p>\"You don't need to worry about that.\"</p>, <p>I cut him off before he could continue.</p>, <p>\"I'll take care of them.\"</p>, <p>Of that I was confident.</p>, <p>Because...</p>, <p>They were coming for me.</p>]\n",

With all sorts of colored pens, pencils, and writing instruments, her desk was anything but clean.</p>, <p>Tossing her script onto the desk, she sat down and opened the pages.</p>, <p>For the past week, it had been her routine to spend at least a few hours trying to analyze the script.</p>, <p>Today was supposed to be no different, but...</p>, <p>\"....How do I do this?\"</p>, <p>His image continued to appear in her mind, sapping away all motivation from her.</p>, <p>The way he acted... From his facial expressions to demenour. It was overwhelming. To the point where she couldn't even find a single flaw.</p>, <p>And the fact that she was supposed to act with 'that' only put more pressure on her.</p>, <p>Her inability to keep up would become glaring to those watching.</p>, <p>Perhaps, they would even think that she didn't put in any effort and that they had selected the wrong person.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"That's not true.\"</p>, <p>Aoife bit her lips.</p>, <p>The effort was there.

For that reason, she needed to spend even more time trying to immerse herself in the role.</p>, <p>Her image was important.</p>, <p>She couldn't let herself tarnish it due to not being able to perform as well as he did.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>\"I'll do it.\"</p>, <p>Regardless of how much it hurt her, she planned on perfectly mastering the character.</p>, <p>For the remaining week until the start of the festival, Aoife only slept three hours a day.</p>, <p>Drip! Drip!</p>, <p>\"....N-no, why are you doing this?\"</p>, <p>Even as her nose bled, she continued to flip through the script while looking at a nearby mirror to check her expressions.</p>, <p>Her face was pale and her hair was a mess, but...</p>, <p>\"I-I... Help!\"</p>, <p>She never once gave up.</p>, <p> And by the time it was time for the festival, Aoife's acting underwent a tremendous transformation.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The festival was a week-long event.</p>, <p>With all sorts of attractions, it was an important event that was designed to showcase the Academy's facilities, and their ability to train the elites of the empire.</p>, <p>The main gate of the Academy was flooded with new faces, all of whom handed invitations that the security guards checked at the front.</p>, <p>\"Hi! Please follow me, I am Josephine, and I will be your guide for today's orientation.\"</p>, <p>At the front of the gate was the cheery Josephine who led a group of several important figures around the Academy campus.</p>, <p>'I guess they had a reason to choose her over Aoife.'</p>, <p>Given how bright her cheerful personality was, she was well-</p>, <p>received by the guests from the outside.</p>, <p>Had Aoife been the one to guide them then...</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>I could already imagine just how stiff the atmosphere would've been.</p>, <p>Looking at the time, 10 A.M. I decided to spend some time looking around at the Academy.</p>, <p>The play wasn't going to start until the third day, and while there indeed were combat exams and mid-terms in the following week, I thought about spending today to destress.</p>, <p>At the rate I was currently pushing my body, it was starting to fail me. For that reason, I had no choice but to spend some time to relax.</p>, <p>Well...</p>, <p>Those were my initial thoughts. However, I knew that I was probably being followed.</p>, <p>'What a pain.'</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I chose to remain outside in public. I didn't know the identity of the person following me. Were they from the organization, or was it the senior?</p>, <p>Either way, I kept my guard up.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>That was until I found my steps halting and I turned to my right.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Our eyes met and she blinked her big eyes. Holding onto a large pastry, she looked around before nearing me.</p>, <p>\".....You didn't see anything.\"</p>, <p>\"I didn't.\"</p>, <p>Her eyes squinted, and I moved my hands over my mouth in a zipping motion.</p>, <p>\"My mouth is sealed.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>From her gaze, I could tell that she didn't seem to believe me, but who would I even tell? It wasn't as if I had any friends to gossip with, and who would even believe me if I told them the chancellor was a pervert who enjoyed being a kid?</p>, <p>\".....?\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, Delilah extended her hand in my direction.</p>, <p>I was taken aback.</p>, <p>\"You want money? I don't have any to give.\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"If not money, then...\"</p>, <p>I patted my pockets and shook my head.</p>, <p>\"I don't have any. They're back in the dorm.\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Yet again, Delilah shook her head.</p>, <p>I frowned and thought about what her actions could mean, but I was stumped. In the end, it was her that explained.</p>, <p>\"Your hand.\"</p>, <p>\"My hand...?\"</p>, <p>I blinked and looked at her hand. It finally clicked, and I leaned my head back.</p>, <p>\"You want me to hold your hand?\"</p>, <p>Nod.</p>, <p>The hell...</p>, <p>\"It'll make things easier for me. My current appearance is too suspicious, and since I can't go in my normal form, I need someone to accompany me.\"</p>, <p>\"....I see.\"</p>, <p>It made sense if she put it that way.</p>, <p>\"But why me?\"</p>, <p>\"Didn't we have an agreement?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>We indeed had one. It was the price that I had to pay for her to train me. Sighing inwardly, I finally relented and grabbed her hand.</p>, <p>She nodded happily and pointed towards the distance.</p>, <p>\"Let's go there. I want to try that.\"</p>, <p>\"Ye-uhk!\"</p>, <p>I didn't even have the time to agree before she suddenly dragged me. For such a little body, she certainly had a lot of strength.</p>, <p>\"We sell cotton candy! The finest cotton candy~!\"</p>, <p>The destination was none other than the cotton candy stand. The line was short, and waiting behind the counter was a rather buff man with a beard.</p>, <p>\"Ho, ho! Are you here for some cotton candy? For your little sister?\"</p>, <p>I looked down at Delilah and felt my mouth twitch.</p>, <p>Sister? How was I going to respond to this?</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Delilah shook her head and responded with a flat voice. The problem lay in the fact that despite her best attempts to sound mature, the polymorph effect distorted her voice, making it sound rather childlike.</p>, <p>\"I'm older than him.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>The shopkeeper blinked his eyes.</p>, <p>On the other hand, Delilah continued.</p>, <p>\"I'm his older sister.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"Oh...\"</p>, <p>I exchanged glances with the man and pursed my lips.</p>, <p>\"It's as she said.\"</p>, <p>\"Ohhh.\"</p>, <p>The shopkeeper winked at me as if he had understood something.</p>, <p>No, she really was older...</p>, <p>\"Would you like some cotton candy? How many would you like?\"</p>, <p>I looked down to see Delilah carefully counting with her little fingers. She seemed to be indecisive between two or three.</p>, <p>\"Three.\"</p>, <p>She eventually settled for three.</p>, <p>\"Coming right up!\"</p>, <p>Despite his appearance, the man was an expert at this. Within moments, he had three sticks done as he handed them to us.</p>, <p>\"That will be ten Rend.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>I looked down at Delilah who looked back at me.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Seriously?</p>, <p>Closing my eyes for a brief moment, I reached out for my wallet and took out a single bill.</p>, <p>\"Here you go.\"</p>, <p>\"It was a pleasure serving you. Next~\"</p>, <p>\"Let's go.\"</p>, <p>\"Ugh!\"</p>, <p>Like that, I was once again dragged around by her.</p>, <p>\"Get me that.\"</p>, <p>Gradually, my wallet started to drain.</p>, <p>\"That too.\"</p>, <p>Whatever had sugar in it, she bought it.</p>, <p>\"I want to try that too.\"</p>, <p>With my money.</p>, <p>\"I want-\"</p>, <p>\"I've run out of money. \"</p>, <p>Looking at my empty wallet, I didn't know whether to feel happy or sad. Maybe it was a mixture of both.</p>, <p>Sad that I was broke, but happy that I no longer had to be dragged around by her.</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Delilah seemed a little disappointed by the development. In the end, throwing away a wrapper, she patted her hand.</p>, <p>\"....I'm satisfied.\"</p>, <p>\"I'm glad you are.\"</p>, <p>Was I finally going to be set free?</p>, <p>Taking out a tissue to clean her hands, Delilah casually glanced behind as her expression flickered back to her usually frosty one. It was as if her entire demenour had changed.</p>, <p>\"You've been followed the entire time, do you know that?\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Surprised by the sudden question, I lowered my head to meet her gaze.</p>, <p>For a moment, I lost myself in her eyes as they stared back at me, threatening to suck me in at any second.</p>, <p>Quickly recovering myself, I realized something.</p>, <p>\"Did you drag me around because you wanted to confirm this?\"</p>, <p>\"No. I just wanted to eat.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>For some reason, it felt like she was half-lying. Perhaps it was a bit of both.</p>, <p>In any case, I nodded my head.</p>, <p>\"Yes, I'm aware.\"</p>, <p>There was no need for me to lie.</p>, <p>\"....Do you want me to help you?\"</p>, <p>\"You're willing to help?\"</p>, <p>It was a bit surprising to hear this. However, after thinking about it for a few seconds, I shook my head and rejected her offer.</p>, <p>\"....I'll have to decline.\"</p>, <p>Whether she was doing it to repay the favor for buying her the candy and stuff, I didn't need her help. Sure, things would indeed be a lot easier were she take matters into her own hands, but that wasn't what I needed.</p>, <p>There was a certain goal I had in mind.</p>, <p>Her interference would ruin what I had in mind.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Delilah stared at me without saying anything. I couldn't tell her thoughts at all, and the more time passed, the more uncomfortable her gaze became.</p>, <p>Just as I was about to say something, her small lips parted open as she went on to ask,</p>, <p>\"I heard you're going to perform at a play.\"</p>, <p>\"....Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Is your role going to be big?\"</p>, <p>\"No, it's not.\"</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Delilah seemed to have fallen into contemplation.</p>, <p>Eventually, raising her head, she said,</p>, <p>\"I'll be watching. Don't disappoint.\"</p>, <p>Her figure gradually blended with the background. Her actions were subtle, with hardly anyone around noticing her sudden disappearance.</p>, <p>I was a little worried that the person observing me would notice something, but I didn't think Delilah would make things difficult for me like that.</p>, <p>'Perhaps there's still an illusion next to me.'</p>, <p>Who knew?</p>, <p>Either way, I looked down at my watch.</p>, <p>There were still a few hours before the first day of the festival ended. I had lost a few hours but still had some time to myself. For now, I planned on enjoying my day.</p>, <p>\"Popping balloon! Pop the balloons and you win a prize!\"</p>, <p>\"Come here and eat the delicious food that we have!\"</p>, <p>\"A one-in-a-million act! Come watch!\"</p>, <p>Hearing the pitches coming from the stalls, I decided to head to one that interested me.</p>, <p>\"A customer!\"</p>, <p>My stomach gurgled at the sight that was before me. It looked like a roasted pig, but at the same time didn't. Perhaps a monster from the mirror dimension...</p>, <p>Either way, it looked and smelled delicious.</p>, <p>\"Looks like you can't resist the smell. Haha, here, I'll prepare one for you. It'll be 15 Rend.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay. \"</p>, <p>I swallowed before reaching out for my wallet. Since I was planning on enjoying a few hours to myself, it wouldn't hurt to try it, right?</p>, <p>Making up my mind, I opened my wallet and prepared to take out a few bills to pay.</p>, <p>Only that...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I had no more money.</p>, <p>\"Here you go, sir~\"</p>]\n",

I'd classify it as mediocre, just barely meeting the mark. It's alright for filling your stomach, but there are much better choices available elsewhere.\"</p>, <p>She was the Empire-renowned 'Iron Tongue' a famed and mysterious food critic that judged the most famous restaurants and food stalls within the Empire.</p>, <p>Every month, in the new issues of 'The Empire Daily', one of the Empire's most renowned magazines, a segment would be dedicated just to her critiques.</p>, <p>Having done this for several years now, she had a cult following that religiously followed her every critique. Many restaurants and food stalls have been affected by her reviews, with several stores shutting down or others booming in business.</p>, <p>In any case, with the festival ongoing, Evelyn decided to suit up and get to work.</p>, <p>While it wasn't much, she did receive a small salary each month for her reviews.</p>, <p>\"Next up...\"</p>, <p>Licking her lips, Evelyn finished the food in her grasp and took out her notepad.</p>, <p>In there, she had a small list of restaurants and stalls that she had to check during the festival.</p>, <p>[Moss's Barbeque]</p>, <p>Evelyn circled it with her pen.</p>, <p>\"I'll go here next.\"</p>, <p>With the decision made, she stood up from her bench and headed towards where the stall was located.</p>, <p>The distance wasn't far. It was about a five-minute walk.</p>, <p>\"Hm.\"</p>, <p>When she arrived, she was surprised to see a familiar figure waiting at the back of the line.</p>, <p>'Kiera?'</p>, <p>Evelyn almost panicked and lowered her hat. It was important that she kept her identity a secret.</p>, <p>If her identity was found out, then a lot of her credibility would shatter. She couldn't allow that to happen.</p>, <p>Even so, as she lowered her hat, she couldn't help but take a second glance at Kiera.</p>, <p>The dazzling sunlight from the sun shone upon her platinum hair, making it shine like a well-polished gem.</p>, <p>With her focus on her wallet, Kiera counted her bills, her expression contorting slightly as she looked up at the price board while muttering, 'What kind of ridiculous pricing is this? You might as well just rob me.'</p>, <p>Words aside, her face—her eyes and nose—held such beauty that onlookers couldn't help but wonder if they'd ever see something similar again.</p>, <p>It was a scene that Evelyn was all too familiar with.</p>, <p>The same was true for her, but with her disguise, she didn't have to worry about such a situation.</p>, <p>Or so she thought.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing?\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Raising her head, she spotted Kiera looking at her with a weird look.</p>, <p>She silently swallowed.</p>, <p>That's right, she might just think my outfit is weird...</p>, <p>\"Evelyn?\"</p>, <p> \"....!\"</p>, <p>Flinching slightly, Evelyn pretended to cough. But that didn't work as Kiera's voice once again rang.</p>, <p>\"What the hell are you doing?\"</p>, <p>\"Ha, this...\"</p>, <p>Seeing that her identity had even been revealed, Evelyn sighed and took off her hat.</p>, <p>\"Yes...\"</p>, <p>She almost sounded resigned.</p>, <p>No, she was resigned.</p>, <p>\"Uh, the fuck...? I knew it was you, but when I actually see it in person, I can't stop the shivers.\"</p>, <p>Kiera rubbed the side of her arms.</p>, <p>\"What the hell are you doing dressed like that?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? I, it's nothing. It's just…\"</p>, <p>With a twitch of her mouth, Evelyn glanced around and explained.</p>, <p>\"It's just that the stares bother me, so I wear this disguise.\"</p>, <p>\"That?\"</p>, <p>Kiera looked at her up and down. Then, as if giving up, she turned back to face the line.</p>, <p>\".....I don't judge.\"</p>, <p>\"Your actions don't match your words.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay, I do. You look ridiculous.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Evelyn kept her mouth shut and just waited behind her. She had pretty much grown used to Kiera's venomous tongue over the past few months. Something like this wasn't going to phase her.</p>, <p>Furthermore, she had a job to do.</p>, <p>[Moss's Barbeque] - A unique chain of pop-up barbeque stalls. With growing fame, it was one of Evelyn's main targets of review.</p>, <p>There were several criteria that she used to judge a pop-up store. One of the criteria was the speed at which the food was served and how efficient the service was.</p>, <p>So far the line was quite fast.</p>, <p>Within a couple of minutes, she was already almost at the front.</p>, <p>'Speed, I'll give it eight out of ten.'</p>, <p>By her standards, that was a great score.</p>, <p>\"Uh? Why the...\"</p>, <p>Just then, she heard Kiera's stunned voice. Raising her head, her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"....Ah?\"</p>, <p>Like Kiera, she couldn't believe that sight before her.</p>, <p>\"Next up.\"</p>, <p>Hearing the all too familiar dry and even voice, Evelyn blinked several times to make sure she wasn't seeing things. Once she was sure that she wasn't, her mouth dropped.</p>, <p>\"....What in the world?\"</p>, <p>Of all the people that she would've expected to serve her, Julien was the last person she thought of.</p>, <p>Wearing an apron, and gloves, he served food with the same stoic expression he always wore.</p>, <p>'How can someone as prideful as him be doing something like this?'</p>, <p>This wasn't the Julien that she knew.</p>, <p>Just what sort of...</p>, <p>\"Next.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah? Kiera?\"</p>, <p>Feeling his gaze, Evelyn turned around and was shocked to see that she was the next up in line. No, clearly Kiera was supposed to be ahead of her, but where did she...</p>, <p>\"Are you not going to order something?\"</p>, <p>\"Oh, no. I will.\"</p>, <p>Seeing that she couldn't find Kiera anywhere, Evelyn glanced at the menu. There were many questions that she wanted to ask, like 'What are you doing here? Why are working here?' and so on. However, she held herself back and just ordered.</p>, <p>\"I'll take a classic, please. With extra sauce.\"</p>, <p>\"Is that all?\"</p>, <p>\"....Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>Taking a small breath, Evelyn waited as her order started to get prepared. She watched as Julien carefully scooped up the meat and placed it over a bun. His actions were fluid and looked rather elegant.</p>, <p>It was odd, but for some reason, the food started to look even more appetizing.</p>, <p>'No, don't let this fool you.'</p>, <p>Evelyn was quick to snap out of such a state.</p>, <p>She was a professional critic. She wasn't going to let that affect her judgment. With a soft, 'Hoo', Evelyn slapped her cheeks and put on a serious face.</p>, <p>Julien came shortly after with her order.</p>, <p>\"That will be fifteen Rend.\"</p>, <p>\"Here.\"</p>, <p>Handing over the money, she received her order and left. Looking around, while holding onto the steaming hot food, she headed over towards a more secluded bench where she sat down.</p>, <p>Looking around, she took out her notepad and started writing.</p>, <p>\"The aroma is enticing, and the overall display is rather pleasing. While I'd recommend incorporating a bit more sauce, Moss's Barbeque has certainly upheld its esteemed reputation thus far...\"</p>, <p>For some reason, she loved to narrate over herself while writing, but it had become a habit of hers and it was too troublesome to change it.</p>, <p>\"Alright, it's time to try it.\"</p>, <p>Sniffing the food, and feeling its powerful aroma, her mouth started to salivate.</p>, <p>What a great smell.</p>, <p>Licking her lips, she brought the bun near her mouth, and...</p>, <p>Took a bite.</p>, <p>\"....Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Her eyes immediately squinted with joy as the juices exploded in her mouth and an intense flavor spread into her tongue.</p>, <p>The more she chewed, the more the flavor intensified.</p>, <p>Stronger, and stronger, and...</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Hold on.</p>, <p>Evelyn's chewing slowed.</p>, <p>Something wasn't...</p>, <p>\"Umm.\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden her lips twisted.</p>, <p>\"....Nn?!\"</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>\"Pfttt!\"</p>, <p>The food flew out of her mouth shortly after.</p>, <p>\"Akh...!\"</p>, <p>Holding onto her throat, her eyes turned bloodshot as she held her throat with both hands.</p>, <p>\"S-salty! H...Help!\"</p>, <p>On the very same day, the 'Iron Tongue' left a scathing review on the 'Empire Times'.</p>, <p>[Moss's Barbecue ] - I've never been to the sea, but I know now what it tastes like. Never again! The shop closed shortly after.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The next two days of the Festival went by in a flash.</p>, <p>Before I knew it, it was the day of the play. Staring at the script before me, I closed my eyes and tried to immerse myself in the role.</p>, <p>I felt my face twitch and a series of emotions flooded my mind. From fear to anger, to sadness... I circulated through all the emotions, but even as I tried my best to find the right combination, I never felt satisfied.</p>, <p>\"....It's not working.\"</p>, <p>Opening my eyes, I stared at my reflection from the mirror positioned in front of me.</p>, <p>I was currently dressed in common clothing. A pair of brow pants, and a white shirt tucked underneath.</p>, <p>I looked like a regular person.</p>, <p>At least in this world.</p>, <p>To Tok—</p>, <p>I heard a knock coming from the entrance of the room and turned in the direction of the door.</p>, <p>\"Come in.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, hello.\"</p>, <p>The one who had entered was none other than the writer. She had a nervous expression on her face.</p>, <p>\"....How are you doing?\"</p>, <p>I could tell why she was worried.</p>, <p>\"I'm fine.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...\"</p>, <p>\"It should be fine.\"</p>, <p>Only then did her face lit up.</p>, <p>\"Really?\"</p>, <p>\"....Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, that's great.\"</p>, <p>Placing her hand on her chest, she let out a visible sigh of relief.</p>, <p>\"It's not like I doubt you. Everyone has seen your skills, but... The way you abruptly left at the reading and how you haven't shown up for the practices left the others a bit worried. But I know it's because you're trying to practice 'method acting'. For this reason, we allowed you to do what you wanted, but I was still pretty worried.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I just quietly listened to the side without saying anything.</p>, <p>What Method Acting. I simply just couldn't do it.</p>, <p>I still let the misunderstanding go on. It wasn't as if I could just tell her I couldn't do it. At least, not this late into the play.</p>, <p>\"Okay then, the play will start in a bit. I'll leave you to it.\"</p>, <p>With those words, she left the room and closed the door behind her.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A strange silence gripped my surroundings as I stood still and turned to face the mirror.</p>, <p>Placing the tips of my fingers over the edges of my mouth, I lightly pushed them up into a smile.</p>, <p>\".....Crazy.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>30 minutes before the play.</p>, <p>Aoife stood in her room and looked at herself in the mirror.</p>, <p>\"Hi~\"</p>, <p>In one moment, her expression was calm and cheerful. It was a stark contrast to her usual self. Her smile was also extremely piercing.</p>, <p>But in the next moment...</p>, <p>\"H-ha... W-why are you doing this to me?\"</p>, <p>Her face was pale, and her pupils shook. It was a complete change that took less than a couple of seconds.</p>, <p>Staring at the mirror, all Aoife could see was a scared woman.</p>, <p>Fear had completely overtaken her as her entire body trembled.

            "[<p>News of the newest play by the renowned writer Olga had already made waves throughout the Empire. After a lot of changes, the name of the play was finalized to; [The Enigma of Midnight Manor].</p>, <p>At the back of the theater, Leon stood by as he watched all the seats slowly start to fill.</p>, <p>\"There's so many people attending.\"</p>, <p>There was a certain tension hanging at the back of the stage.</p>, <p>Having worked for the past week to ensure that the project would flow well, all the staff and cadets were eagerly awaiting the final results of the play.</p>, <p>Would their hard work pay off?</p>, <p>\"From what I've heard all the seats have been sold. That's over two thousand seats. It's crazy.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh my god! Look over there! That's Jayce Milner from the Black Hound Guild!\"</p>, <p>\"Ah! That's Clara from the Thorn Roses Guild!\"</p>, <p>\"I see more! There's so many big shots attending today...!\"</p>, <p>Most of the nervousness came from the important figures that were attending today's play.</p>, <p>Glancing around, Leon could see that most of the important members of the major Guilds were present.</p>, <p>Because of how many important figures were present, security was tight. Not that it was required since everyone present could defend themself.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, what they didn't know was the fact that while they could indeed defend themselves, the same wasn't true for the cadets.</p>, <p>Thankfully, it didn't seem like anyone was a target.</p>, <p>The only target as of right now was Julien who was getting ready to start the play.</p>, <p>'.....He'll probably attack soon.'</p>, <p>Most likely just after the second Act. While his target was Julien, his real goal was Aoife.</p>, <p>For that reason, he was probably waiting for the right time to interfere.</p>, <p>\"I should get ready.\"</p>, <p>Their target was rather strong. Leon didn't think he'd be able to defeat him alone. However, with Julien, the situation might just turn out differently.</p>, <p>Either way, he had a goal in mind in all of this.</p>, <p>Turning his wrist, Leon checked his watch. Sensing that it was about time, he quietly left the premises.</p>, <p>He had a place to be.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The noise at the theater was starting to quiet down as the play was set to start in the following minutes. Sat the very front were three individuals.</p>, <p>\"What do you think? Do you think this play will get a five-star?\"</p>, <p>\"I'm not sure, but I have faith in Olga.\"</p>, <p>\"We'll see about that.\"</p>, <p>Dressed in formal attires, they were none other than the critics in charge of assessing the play.</p>, <p>\"I've heard that they have several immature cadets participating. I know that this is a criteria proposed by Haven, but to be so confident in having it judged today...\"</p>, <p>One of the judges shook his head.</p>, <p>\"I don't know whether she's bold, or just delusional.\"</p>, <p>\"Hah, who knows? I've heard that one of the performing actors is quite talented.\"</p>, <p>\"Again with that nonsense? You've been in the industry for as long as I have. You should know very well that it's just standard bullshit to drive the publicity. I can bet you 100 Rend that he's probably just above the mediocre threshold. Don't get your hopes up.\"</p>, <p> \"If you put it like that...\"</p>, <p>Expectations were rather mixed. While on one hand, the judges believed that the play was going to be great, they didn't have much faith in the 'super rookie' that was spread all over the news.</p>, <p>\"Please disregard the fact that the performers are mere cadets when evaluating. If they happen to make mistakes, ensure to document them accordingly.\"</p>, <p>This was a serious evaluation.</p>, <p>They weren't going to let the fact that rookies were playing affect their judgment.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Sat a few rows just above them, and overhearing the evaluation from the critics, Delilah cocked her head slightly.</p>, <p>Today she was in her usual form, and while seated down, she could feel the gazes of all those around her wander to her.</p>, <p>\"What do you think about what they said? Do you agree with them?\"</p>, <p>Seated next to her was a handsome man with well-polished features and green eyes. He was the current Vice-Leader of the [The Order of the Silver Seraphs], one of the fifteen major Guilds.</p>, <p>He was about her age, and while he wasn't as powerful as her, he was someone who was held in high esteem.</p>, <p>Looking at him, Delilah shook her head without saying anything.</p>, <p>\"Haha? So you think the performances of the rookies will be good?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Delilah didn't say anything again.</p>, <p>In all honesty, she didn't know. Would Julien even be a great actor? Sure, he was an emotive mage, but displaying emotions was different from influencing emotions...</p>, <p>There was also Aoife.</p>, <p>Was her acting going to be great? Glancing to her side where a familiar yellow-eyed figure sat, she leaned back on her chair.</p>, <p>Atlas Megrail.</p>, <p>It was rare for her to see him attend such gatherings. However, given that his niece Aoife was performing, perhaps he decided to take his time to watch.</p>, <p>Delilah wasn't sure.</p>, <p>He was a hard man to read.</p>, <p>\"Personally, I agree with them. We're talking about some of the best actors in the entire Empire. How is it possible for mere cadets to compete with them? I think they'll be carried by-\"</p>, <p>His words ceased abruptly as the theater's lights flickered off, plunging the surroundings into darkness.</p>, <p>\"It's starting.\"</p>, <p>\"Quiet down.\"</p>, <p>Swooosh!</p>, <p>The curtains spread, and the stage lights flickered open, revealing the insides of a bakery.</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>A lone footfall shattered the silence enveloping the surroundings as a figure clad in a brown jacket and top hat strode in.</p>, <p>Following right behind him was a man wearing a gray undervest and squared-frame glasses.</p>, <p>Joseph and his assistant had made their appearance.</p>, <p>[Huaam.]</p>, <p>Yawning, Joseph, who Darius was playing looked around. His voice was crisp, and audible for all to hear.</p>, <p>[Uh... This is where she worked, is that correct?]</p>, <p>[Yes, this is the bakery.]</p>, <p>There wasn't much dialogue to start with, but the audience was already drawn by the start of the play. There was something about the acting, and the sullen atmosphere surrounding the bakery that made one wonder what exactly was happening.</p>, <p>[Emily Stein.]</p>, <p>Fixing his glasses, the assistant unfurled a piece of paper from his breast pocket as he leaned his head back to get a better read.</p>, <p>[The owner's daughter. According to the details, she seems to have vanished sometime yesterday.]</p>, <p>[Ah, uh, yeah... I see.]</p>, <p>With a subtle nod, Joseph surveyed the surroundings, idly tracing his finger along the surface of the bakery, staring at his finger in the process.</p>, <p>With a lazy expression on his face, he ruffled his hair before his eyelids partially closed.</p>, <p>[Place looks clean...]</p>, <p>Perhaps used to the sight he was seeing, the assistant looked around before seriously muttering.</p>, <p>[There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the place. The crime likely occurred outside of the bakery. Should we...]</p>, <p>[Give me a second.]</p>, <p>Covering his mouth and letting out another yawn, Joseph dragged one of the wooden chairs back and sat down.</p>, <p>[.....Huu, I'm getting too old for this. Elbert, how about you survey the bakery for evidence while I take a na... Ehhh, recover my energy.]</p>, <p>[....]</p>, <p>Adjusting his glasses, Elbert opened his mouth but held his words back and nodded. He went on the leave the stage, leaving Joseph the only one remaining.</p>, <p>With his back facing the audience, he stared ahead.</p>, <p>No one could truly make out his expression. It was hidden from all to see.</p>, <p>[Emily Stein.]</p>, <p>The only thing they could detect was his voice. A change occurred in the audience when he spoke. There was a sudden change in tone, his voice no longer sounding lazy, but extremely serious and hoarse.</p>, <p>It served to build tension as the lights of the stage flickered and darkness enveloped the surroundings.</p>, <p>Cli Cla—!</p>, <p>[Dissapeared yesterday.]</p>, <p>In the darkness, Joseph's voice continued to echo.</p>, <p>[Baker's daughter. Was looking for missing equipment.]</p>, <p>His words, though soft, gently reached the ears of all the audience present as a strange tension suddenly gripped the surroundings.</p>, <p>[What a problematic scenario.]</p>, <p>Cli Cla—!</p>, <p>The light turned back on, and all audience held their breath at the sight that greeted them.</p>, <p>Still sitting on the wooden chair with his back turned against theirs, the entire surroundings had changed. No longer was he in the bakery. He appeared to be in the middle of a long alleyway.</p>, <p>But the most glaring thing about the surroundings was that...</p>, <p>\"Gray.\"</p>, <p>It was all gray.</p>, <p>Delilah found herself immersed in the play.</p>, <p>But if that wasn't all, standing right before Joseph was another man. With his back similarly facing the audience, he stood tall, staring at the end of the alleyway.</p>, <p>There, a figure appeared.</p>, <p>Wearing simple clothes and an apron, her beauty couldn't be hidden as she instantly captured the attention of the audience.</p>, <p>Her expression was one of helplessness as she moved forward, towards Joseph and the man that stood before him.</p>, <p>For some reason, the audience found themselves frowning at the scene...</p>, <p>'No, you shouldn't go to the man.'</p>, <p>'He's dangerous.'</p>, <p>Even though he had done nothing, and had just stood there the entire time, the audience felt a strange tension coming from him as Aoife moved to him.</p>, <p>Unknowingly, Delilah found herself leaning forward a bit.</p>, <p>She wanted to get a better look at the scene.</p>, <p>[Ah, excuse me! Do you perhaps know if any shops are still open where I can buy some parts for a broken mixer?]</p>, <p>The moment she spoke, everyone held their breaths.</p>, <p>For some reason, there was something about her voice and tone that made everyone forget about her looks. She truly seemed to have embodied her character.</p>, <p>[....]</p>, <p>The sound of heavy breathing echoed out as some of the audience members swallowed under the tension that gripped the auditorium as they all looked at the mysterious figure.</p>, <p>Each second that ticked felt stifling. Almost as if someone was trying to reach for their throat and choke them.</p>, <p>That was until he finally spoke.</p>, <p>[.... You're looking for a replacement?]</p>, <p>Despite not being able to see his face, just from the sound of his voice, the audience felt themselves holding their breaths.</p>, <p>What sort of expression was he making? How did he look like? Does he kill her?</p>, <p>With just a few words, he managed to bring forth many questions in the minds of the audience.</p>, <p>The play continued.</p>, <p>[Yes, I am.]</p>, <p>Aoife naively nodded her head with a strange glint in her eyes. One that contained excitement and hope.</p>, <p>Such an innocent sight...</p>, <p>[I know, yes... I know of a place.]</p>, <p>It only served to add to the tension that the mysterious character brought.</p>, <p>[You do...?!]</p>, <p>[Yes, please go straight. If you just keep going there, you can find it.]</p>, <p>[Thank you so much!]</p>, <p>Facing the audience, Aoife crossed the man and Joseph before disappearing.</p>, <p>[....]</p>, <p>Yet again, silence gripped the surroundings as all eyes fell on the mysterious man. At the moment, everyone was wondering the same thing.</p>, <p>What sort of expression was he making?</p>, <p>They didn't need to wait for long to find out. Gradually, he turned his head to face the audience, revealing his features.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>Many held their breaths at the sight that greeted them. His appearance bordered perfection, with a visible jaw, and well-</p>, <p>maintained hair. His hazel eyes shone with a strange intensity that drew the eyes of all present, creating a suffocating atmosphere.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>Despite his flawless appearance, none of the audience members found it within them to admire it.</p>, <p>With an unfocused gaze and lips that flickered from a smile to neutrality, several of the members of the audience felt their skin crawl.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>If anything, his appearance added to the chill his gaze gave.</p>, <p>[R-red...]</p>, <p>He quietly mumbled as his head lowered to meet Joseph's as he raised his head to meet his gaze.</p>, <p>[....I want to see it.]</p>, <p>Cli Cla—!</p>, <p>The surroundings turned dark.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Cli Cla—!</p>, <p>When the lights turned on, color returned to the stage as Joseph was again in the bakery.</p>, <p>Compared to the previously oppressive atmosphere, the atmosphere was now a lot less suffocating.</p>, <p>[....]</p>, <p>Sitting in the same spot, Joseph remained quiet the entire time until he lowered his head to rub his face.</p>, <p>[Face... What did his face look like?]</p>, <p>There was one clear disadvantage to the visions.</p>, <p>It was that he couldn't remember the faces of the parties involved.</p>, <p>[Damn it.]</p>, <p>But it wasn't without hope.</p>, <p>[White shirt, brown pants, and undervest...]</p>, <p>He could remember the clothes he had worn and the location of the incident.</p>, <p>Coming down from the stairs was his assistant Elbert who pushed his glasses back up.</p>, <p>[I wasn't able to find any evidence. The place is clean. It's unfortunate, but we might have to look somewhere else for clues.]</p>, <p>His steps eventually stopped not far from where Joseph was.</p>, <p>[What about you? Have you found anything...?]</p>, <p>[....]</p>, <p>[Detective?]</p>, <p>[....Uh, ah right.]</p>, <p>Joseph snapped out of his thoughts and looked back.</p>, <p>[What did you say, again?]</p>, <p>[Did you find anything?]</p>, <p>[Oh, that.]</p>, <p>He shook his head.</p>, <p>[No, not really. I do have some ideas though. Troublesome, but... Haa, I need the money, so I have no choice.]</p>, <p>Finally standing up from his seat, Joseph took a long and dragged out a breath before turning around and heading towards the exit.</p>, <p>[Detective? What are we doing here? This is the fifth house that we've visited. How is this supposed to help us?]</p>, <p>[Just wait.]</p>, <p>The scenery changed. Coming out of the bakery, they appeared before a large wooden door and knocked.</p>, <p>To Tok—</p>, <p>[How can I help you?]</p>, <p>Greeting them at the door was a familiar figure. Instantly, the atmosphere around the theater turned tense. And yet... For some reason, that faded the moment they noticed the warm smile on the figure's face.</p>, <p>To the audience, he looked like a very friendly person. A vast difference from the person in the vision.</p>, <p>The stark contrast made a few uncomfortable.</p>, <p>'Is that really him?'</p>, <p> 'It can't be the same person, right...? How does that even make sense?'</p>, <p>Removing his hat, the detective introduced himself alongside his assistant.</p>, <p>[Let me introduce myself. I'm Detective Joseph, and this man over here is my assistant.]</p>, <p>He too greeted the man with a polite and warm smile.</p>, <p>[A detective?]</p>, <p>[Yes. I'm sorry, but could we ask you some questions?]</p>, <p>[....But of course.]</p>, <p>The man invited them in.</p>, <p>But just before he let them in, he introduced himself.</p>, <p>[Oh, before I forget. My name is Azarias. It's a pleasure to meet you.]</p>, <p>[Azarias? What a nice name.]</p>, <p>[Thank you.]</p>, <p>The scene once again shifted.</p>, <p>They were now all sitting around a wooden table. On the table sat a small tray bearing three cups of warm tea.</p>, <p>[I'm sorry for this. It's all I can offer.]</p>, <p>[Oh, there's no problem.]</p>, <p>Taking a sip of the tea, Joseph joked.</p>, <p>[I can't tell the difference between good tea and bad tea anyway. It all tasted like grass one.]</p>, <p>In return, Azarias smiled.</p>, <p>[I can't say I'm any different.]</p>, <p>The atmosphere was lighthearted and warm. It seemed to be a regular and friendly talk between two friends.</p>, <p>That, however, took a more serious turn when Joseph started his investigation. Just slightly, his demenour shifted, becoming a lot more serious.</p>, <p>[I'll start off by asking a simple question. Where were you yesterday night at around 10 P.M?]</p>, <p>[At around 10 P.M?]</p>, <p>Despite the sudden shift in Joseph's demenour, Azarias didn't seem to be phased as he started to seriously ponder.</p>, <p>[Hmm, I'm not sure... I think I was at my store. If you don't know, I'm the owner of a flower shop.]</p>, <p>[A flower shop?]</p>, <p>[Yes, I love to take flowers.]</p>, <p>Glancing around, Joseph did indeed notice that the place was filled with flowers.</p>, <p>[You seem to like roses.]</p>, <p>[....I've been told that a lot. But it's not really the roses that I like. There are several others that I like.]</p>, <p>[Hmm, I see.]</p>, <p>With a nod, Joseph went straight to business.</p>, <p>Opening his coat, he took out a small portrait and placed it down on the table.</p>, <p>[Emily Stein.]</p>, <p>He tapped the portrait with his finger.</p>, <p>[That's the name of the girl that has been missing since yesterday. Have you perhaps seen her before?]</p>, <p>[....]</p>, <p>Azarias only stared at the photo for a couple of seconds, and yet... For some reason, the atmosphere felt suffocating. Even with his warm features and expression, there was something offsetting about him.</p>, <p>Gradually, he picked up the picture and took a look at it.</p>, <p>[I think I've seen her before, I'm not quite sure where.]</p>, <p>[You have?]</p>, <p>[Yeah, but I'm not quite sure where...]</p>, <p>[It's a small town. She worked at the bakery down the street. Perhaps that's where you've seen her.]</p>, <p>[Ah, that's perhaps where.]</p>, <p>Azarias smiled yet again, slowly placing the portrait down and shaking his head.</p>, <p>[I'm sorry, but I wish I could help you out more. If there's anything that I can do to help the investigation, I'd be more than willing to help.]</p>, <p>[That would be appreciated.]</p>, <p>Turning around and staring at the flowers, Joseph had a sudden thought as he voiced out.</p>, <p>[That store of yours... You won't mind if we visit it, right?]</p>, <p>[My store?]</p>, <p>Confused, Azarais tilted his head.</p>, <p>Joseph continued, this time, his demenour was less serious than before as it returned to the friendly one from before.</p>, <p>[I've been meaning to buy a few flowers for my wife. I might as well take advantage of the opportunity. I hope you don't mind. Plus, I can do a small checkaround. If you're innocent, I'm sure you won't mind, right?]</p>, <p>[Ah...]</p>, <p>Azarias's eyes flickered slightly. It was only brief, barely noticeable if one didn't pay close attention. But...</p>, <p>To the audience who was indeed paying attention, it was all seen.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, nobody could tell whether Joseph had noticed or not as he happily smiled and received the keys to the shop from Azarais who didn't follow him out.</p>, <p>[Haha, I will be coming back shortly to return the keys. Please don't run away.]</p>, <p>Though he said that jokingly, Joseph ordered his assistant to stay on guard outside of the house.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>Once the door closed, Azarias was the only one remaining in the room.</p>, <p>[.....]</p>, <p>Silence gripped the surroundings as he stood by himself with a warm smile on his face. It was a smile that lit up the room.</p>, <p>But gradually...</p>, <p>The smile started to change flavor.</p>, <p>It slowly started to grow unsettling. Almost chilling.</p>, <p>The lights started to dim, and right before the audience, the colors started to fade, gradually turning the entire world gray.</p>, <p>But strangely enough, in the gray world, one color remained.</p>, <p>It was the red from the roses.</p>, <p>With Azarias standing in the middle, the curtains started to close, signaling the end of the first Act. In the last moments before the curtains fully engulfed Azarias, he opened his mouth to speak as a familiar cold and dry voice echoed out loud.</p>, <p>[....I'll see you soon.]</p>, <p>The curtains fully closed then, and the theater turned dark.</p>, <p>....The first Act had ended.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Aoife stood behind the stage and took a deep breath. The lights slowly turned on for the first intermission as the audience sat with their mouths closed, eyes still fixed towards the front.</p>, <p>From their expression, it was clear that they were heavily invested in the play.</p>, <p>\"That's good...\"</p>, <p>Aoife sighed in relief.</p>, <p>It was clear that she didn't disappoint with her performance.</p>, <p>But even so...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Staring towards a certain man, who was currently heading towards his private room under everyone's watch, Aoife lowered her head.</p>, <p>It was still not enough.</p>, <p>She...</p>, <p>Was still not good enough.</p>, <p>'Just how much more do I need to do to keep up with him...?'</p>, <p>She was honestly scared. Especially since their scene was about to come up. Aoife felt like she was in top form, but even that didn't seem to be enough.</p>, <p>'More.'</p>, <p>Her current form was good, but not good enough to keep up with him.</p>, <p>She had to do more.</p>, <p>Especially since 'he' was watching her. Aoife couldn't let herself be swallowed by Julien's acting. With a soft 'huu' Aoife massaged her cheeks and took out the script.</p>, <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>, <p>\"Ah...!\"</p>, <p>It was almost falling apart, as she had to try her best to prevent some of the pages from falling.</p>, <p>Making sure that all the papers were in order, she focused her attention back on the script.</p>, <p>Perfection.</p>, <p>She would only stop at perfection.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Huh...\"</p>, <p>Coming back into my room, I sat down and took a deep breath. I was mentally exhausted, and my head hurt a little. Staring at the script, I flipped through the lines before putting on my makeup.</p>, <p>Flip, flip, flip—!</p>, <p>The next scene was the scene where I would kill Aoife.</p>, <p>It was another small flashback scene.</p>, <p>However, this scene held great importance as the play was still in its introductory phases. My role was to 'highlight' Joseph's ability.</p>, <p>My death would come not long after. Compared to the whole script, I didn't have a lot of screen time. Even so, my role was important.</p>, <p>I had to make sure to leave an impact on the audience.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>It was that part that stumped me.</p>, <p>\"I still can't get a proper grasp on this.\"</p>, <p>I tossed the script over the desk. It was annoying. Regardless of how hard I tried, I still struggled to come close to understanding the character.</p>, <p>....It was just impossible.</p>, <p>Azarias was a total psychopath. Someone whose mind and emotions were hard to properly understand. For a brief moment, my gaze wandered towards the four-leaved clover tattoo on my forearm.</p>, <p>If there was one method that could help, then...</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>I was quick to throw the idea away. The wheel was a gamble. I could very well end up with an emotion that would have the complete opposite effect.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>If only I could get into Azarias's mind...</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>I massaged my forehead.</p>, <p>\"What a troublesome situation.\"</p>, <p>To Tok—!</p>, <p>\"The play will start shortly. Please make your way into the stage.\"</p>, <p>Hearing the organizer's voice, I took a deep breath and adjusted my clothing.</p>, <p>Making sure that everything was on point, I reached for the handle and opened the door.</p>, <p>What greeted me was a long and narrow corridor.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>I looked around.</p>, <p>Where was the organizer...? And why was it so dark?</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>WOOOOM—!</p>, <p>Something streaked past my cheek. I was hardly able to react on time as I tilted my head just slightly to the right.</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip.</p>, <p>I felt a sharp pain by the side of my cheek and frowned.</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>From across the space, a subtle and repetitive scratching sound caught my attention as a figure stepped out from the darkness.</p>, <p>\"You dodged that?\"</p>, <p>His voice was hoarse, almost croaky as I remained silent.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stared at him without saying a word. Slowly, his appearance became known to me, and I lowered my head.</p>, <p>So you're finally here...</p>]\n",

I knew it was coming.</p>, <p>Although looking around and seeing that there was no one present, I found the situation to be rather odd.</p>, <p>How did he manage to get everyone away from here?</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>The only sound that echoed was the weird and unsettling sound of his scratching.</p>, <p>\"You.... Ah, I need that role.\"</p>, <p>He was breathing heavily and uncomfortably. With just a glance, I could see that he wasn't in the right state of mind.</p>, <p>'A psychopath.'</p>, <p>I remained calm.</p>, <p>\"You need the role?\"</p>, <p>And tried to buy as much time as possible.</p>, <p>\"The Azarias one?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes...

I controlled myself for so long. Long. Long. Long. Long. So much control! Ha! I lost my role! Because of you! All that effort! How could that be? Theremustbesomesortofmistake!!\"</p>, <p>I had a hard time understanding the last part of his sentence as he spat those words at a rapid speed.</p>, <p>Perhaps because his anger was starting to rise, he started to lose his mind.</p>, <p>\"Ah! This is nonsense! HowcouldtheytellmetostopwhenIhavebeenwaitingforsolong!!!\"</p>, <p>The mana started to agglomerate in his direction at a rapid speed. So much that it was starting to feel suffocating.</p>, <p>'As expected, I can't beat him with my current power...'</p>, <p>He was simply too strong for the current me.</p>, <p>Swooosh—!</p>, <p>His figure blurred, and he appeared right in front of me. I was fast to react, moving my left hand in front of me.</p>, <p>CLANK—!</p>, <p>A large metallic sound rang out as sparks flew and I took several steps back. My entire left hand felt numb as the chain scattered away.</p>, <p>\"Ukh..!\"</p>, <p>I felt a sweet sensation at the back of my throat I coughed several times.</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>The gap between us was quite large, but it wasn't as though it was impossible for me.</p>, <p>Well, not that it mattered.</p>, <p>I wasn't alone.</p>, <p>\"Julien E—\"</p>, <p>Before he could finish his words, something smacked him by the side of his face.</p>, <p>!</p>, <p> With a powerful blow, he staggered forward. In that instant, I clenched my hand, and purple threads burst forth, entwining around his ankles and hands.</p>, <p>His entire body started to spasm as his face paled and his features contorted.</p>, <p>\"Akh...! This!\"</p>, <p>A figure emerged from the spot behind him. With a quiet step, Leon looked at me with a frown.</p>, <p>\"Is this it?\"</p>, <p>\"....For now.\"</p>, <p>I still wasn't sure if he had left something else for me.</p>, <p>\"I'll take care of him. Go check around the stage.\"</p>, <p>\"....Got it.\"</p>, <p>Leon disappeared shortly after. Only then did I shift my attention back to the senior.</p>, <p>\"Now then.\"</p>, <p>What was I going to do with him?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was the start of the second Act.</p>, <p>The audience was already sitting in their seats, waiting for it to start. Throughout the entire short break, none of the members of the audience said a word as they waited for the play to start again.</p>, <p>They were all wondering the same thing; 'What did he mean by see you soon? Is there something in the shop?'</p>, <p>The air was thick with anticipation.</p>, <p>Standing backstage, Aoife took a deep breath.</p>, <p>All the noise drowned out from her ears as she focused entirely on her role.</p>, <p>\"Ah.. aH, ah, Ah...\"</p>, <p>Massaging her throat, she tried her best to find the right tone and pitch. She spent the better part of the break doing so, and while she was busy doing this, she noticed a certain panic spread throughout the back.</p>, <p>\"Where is he...?\"</p>, <p>\"I can't find him.\"</p>, <p>\"I knocked on his room, but he's gone.\"</p>, <p>\"What? How could this be? It can't be that he left, right?\"</p>, <p>When she turned her head, she could see that all the staff was rushing around in panic.</p>, <p>\"What's going on...?\"</p>, <p>Seeing how distressed they were, Aoife frowned. She was just about to ask what was going on when she picked up the conversation of a few actors beside her.</p>, <p>\"Do you think he ran away? Just like the reading room?\"</p>, <p>\"Damn it. I knew it... Last time he left because he couldn't do it. I guess the pressure got to him. But what do we do?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, this. I can't believe this is happening now of all times.\"</p>, <p>Familiar with the events of the reading room, Aoife understood the subject of their talk. Her frown deepened.</p>, <p>'He ran away? Julien...?'</p>, <p>Aoife had a hard time believing this.</p>, <p>Recalling the scene she had seen a while back when he had been practicing by himself in the classroom and pushing himself to the point where his own body was failing him, Aoife didn't think for one second that he was that type of person.</p>, <p>She knew... because he was just like her.</p>, <p>\"Something must have happened.\"</p>, <p>It was the only explanation.</p>, <p>Cli Cla—</p>, <p>The lights of the theater turned dark, and the play resumed.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>Aoife took a deep breath and headed towards the side of the stage. The next scene was her death scene.</p>, <p>\"Do something!\"</p>, <p>\"Look around for him!\"</p>, <p>While everyone was still scrambling to find out where Julien was, she cleared her mind and removed all distracting thoughts.</p>, <p>Whether he was going to show up or not, that didn't matter to her right now.</p>, <p>What she needed to do right now was focus on her role.</p>, <p>[Is this the shop? It looks rather nice.]</p>, <p>Darius's voice echoed from the stage, as the play resumed. He was now standing in front of a small flower-shaped.</p>, <p>He was by himself, and inserting the keys into the key socket, he slowly opened it, revealing the vast number of flowers within.</p>, <p>[Hm?]</p>, <p>To the surprise of the audience, and Joseph, the flowers.</p>, <p>They were all...</p>, <p>[Roses.]</p>, <p>No, not quite.</p>, <p>[Red.]</p>, <p>It was an odd sight, one that left the audience in question once more.</p>, <p>[I did think he liked roses, but who would've thought he'd like them so much that he'd have a whole shop of them?]</p>, <p>With a bitter laugh, Joseph walked around the shop. Just as he did in the bakery, he traced his finger across the furniture, seemingly looking for something.</p>, <p>As he was doing this, a voice quietly whispered to Aoife.</p>, <p>\"Get ready, your part is about to start soon.\"</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>Aoife nodded with a serious expression.</p>, <p>Looking around, she could see that the staff was still panicked. Julien... He was still not in sight.</p>, <p>\"Maam? What do we do...? At this rate...!\"</p>, <p>\"Get someone else to do it. Ugh, ah!\"</p>, <p>It wasn't uncommon for incidents to occur during a play. For that reason, ' extras' were used to fill the role in case a situation arose.</p>, <p>While they weren't as good as the main actors, they still knew the lines and what to do.</p>, <p>Staring back, Aoife saw a man wearing similar clothes to what Julien had worn getting ready.</p>, <p>He was most likely going to be Julien's replacement.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>For some reason, Aoife didn't like the idea. Rather, she detested it as her fists slowly clenched tightly.</p>, <p>'I didn't push myself to this point just to have someone else take over your role...'</p>, <p>Besides doing it for herself, another reason why Aoife pushed herself to the point of exhaustion was so that she wouldn't get swallowed by his acting.</p>, <p>Aoife had to admit.</p>, <p>He was far better than her in that aspect. It was for that reason that she pushed herself so much.</p>, <p>...And seeing that someone else was about to take over his role, Aoife felt as though half of her efforts had been for nothing.</p>, <p>It was a frustrating feeling.</p>, <p>One that she could only push down as she felt a gentle push on her back.</p>, <p>\"Go, it's your turn.\"</p>, <p>Nodding her head, Aoife took a deep breath and stepped to enter the stage.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>With his entire body weak, Alexander slowly opened his eyes.</p>, <p>He couldn't tell what had happened as it had happened all too fast. His body hung suspended in the air as he felt weak all over. When he looked around, he appeared to be in a storage room.</p>, <p>Alexander had a hard time seeing. His mind was foggy, and his vision was blurry.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Where is this? What's...\"</p>, <p>Because of how weak his body was, he could hardly get his words out.</p>, <p>\"Just in time.\"</p>, <p>A figure gradually appeared in his vision.</p>, <p>\"I would've had to force you awake soon enough.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh... How...?\"</p>, <p>Coughing several times, Alexander slowly raised his head. He tried to free himself from the threads, but his body simply refused to listen to him as the energy was drained completely out of him.</p>, <p>\"I've been waiting for quite a while for you to act.\"</p>, <p>With an indifferent gaze, he looked down at him.</p>, <p>\"Wha.... How!?\"</p>, <p>\"It doesn't matter how. Just know that I know you were watching me.\"</p>, <p>\"How did you...!\"</p>, <p>Alexander struggled to grasp the conversation he was having. How was it possible for him to know that he was watching him? Furthermore, how was it possible for him to know that he was planning on doing something...!?</p>, <p>His face twitched as his neck itched. If only he could scratch it...</p>, <p>Still, he managed to force a laugh.</p>, <p>\"Do you think this is over? There's more co...\"</p>, <p>\"I know.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>\"There's more coming, right? I know.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>The itchy feeling became more pronounced, forcing his face to twist.</p>, <p>\"That, how could you...\"</p>, <p>Who, in the world.</p>, <p>\"How!!!\"</p>, <p>Mustering the little energy that he had remaining in his body, Alexander viciously screamed. His voice cracked halfway through, showing just how desperate he was.</p>, <p>\"That's not something for you to concern yourself.\"</p>, <p>But the man before him seemed completely unfazed.</p>, <p>Just then, he took a step closer to him and lowered his body down. Their gazes met, and Alexander stopped screaming.</p>, <p>\"You're a psychopath.\"</p>, <p>Those were the words that came out of his mouth as he addressed him.</p>, <p>\".....I play the role of a psychopath.\"</p>, <p>\"Whaat...?\"</p>, <p>A shadow cast over Alexander's features as Julien's hand drew near his face.</p>, <p>\"Let me see your world.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>Under the bright lights that shone down, the sound of Aoife's step echoed.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>The color started to fade from the surroundings, and alongside the color, the sound of her steps became more rushed.</p>, <p>\"Haa.... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Her chest heaved up and down, and her hands tingled.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>It was quiet, and in the quiet world, a figure stood at its center. It was Joseph. He was looking right at her who was running in the alleyways.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>It was really quiet on the stage. The only sound that Aoife could perceive was the rushed sounds of her steps and breath. It was a strange and uncomfortable feeling.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>It made her body feel weak and limp.</p>, <p>While she knew that everyone was watching, slowly that feeling was starting to fade.</p>, <p>Gradually, she was starting to immerse herself in the role.</p>, <p>All the lights faded and emotions that she tried to force herself the entire week started to enter her.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'I'm still missing something.'</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Aoife could tell she had entered a zone. An immersive zone that would make all actors envy her.</p>, <p>But it wasn't perfect.</p>, <p>There was still something that she was missing.</p>, <p>But what...?</p>, <p>What could she be missing?</p>, <p>And then, her steps stopped.</p>, <p>\"Oh, ah...\"</p>, <p>A wall appeared before her. Aoife's expression cracked, and helplessness washed over her body. With a flick of her head, she glanced behind, where darkness swallowed the other end of the alleyway.</p>, <p>A figure stood in that darkness. It remained there, carefully observing her.</p>, <p>Aoife squeezed her chest.</p>, <p>\"W-what do you want from me...!\"</p>, <p>Her voice came out hoarse, almost screeching. From the tone to the pitch. It was perfect. Almost flawless.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>It was still not enough for her.</p>, <p>Something was still missing in her performance.</p>, <p>What was it?</p>, <p>Tak.</p>, <p>She heard a soft step. The shadow inched closer.</p>, <p>\"G-get away from me!\"</p>, <p>Gradually, the shadow's appearance revealed itself, and Aoife held her breath.</p>, <p>Standing tall, and with the same flawless appearance of his, it was none other than Julien. He looked the same as he usually did, no...</p>, <p>There was something different about the current him.</p>, <p>It made Aoife's chest grow heavy.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>And took the words away from her. It was as if he had stolen her voice.</p>, <p>It was then that Aoife finally understood what was missing from her play.</p>, <p>Fear.</p>, <p>It was real fear.</p>, <p>\"Haaa.... Haaa... Haa..\"</p>, <p>And staring at the all too familiar figure standing on the opposite end, Aoife swallowed. His eyes, hollow and devoid of any light, and yet filled with a certain madness, stared back at her, sending chills down her entire body.</p>, <p>\"Ah..\"</p>, <p>Finally, she felt it.</p>, <p>\"Gh...!\"</p>, <p>Fear.</p>, <p>True fear.</p>, <p>And her voice returned.</p>, <p>\"G-g.. Akh... Get away from... me!!\"</p>]\n",

Haaa... No, p-lease...]</p>, <p>Aoife's voice sounded crisp and smooth. The subtle trembles in her tone, added to the subtle shaking of her body created an extremely realistic portrayal.</p>, <p>Her acting was so immersive that the audience found themselves sitting upright.</p>, <p>But while her acting was phenomenal, the man who stood before her was the true centerpiece of the play.</p>, <p>Standing a few meters away from her, he gave off an oppressive feeling.</p>, <p>Within the gray world, he alone sucked the eyes of all present.</p>, <p>[.....]</p>, <p>By just standing there, it felt as though the entire room was gripped under his hands, slowly squeezing down at their throats.</p>, <p>Tok--</p>, <p>The quiet sound of his footsteps shattered the silence that overtook the theater as some of the audience flinched.</p>, <p>True was also for Aoife who stepped back, her back pressing against the wall behind her.</p>, <p>[W-what are you doing....!?]</p>, <p>Portraying helplessness, Aoife's eyes shook.</p>, <p>[.....]</p>, <p>Yet, again, there was no reply.</p>, <p>The only thing that the audience could see was the madness in his gaze.</p>, <p>Tok--</p>, <p>With each step that he took, the more tense the surroundings became.</p>, <p>Tok--</p>, <p>For some reason...</p>, <p>Tok--</p>, <p>With each step that he took...</p>, <p>Tok--</p>, <p>The audience felt their hearts speed up alongside it.</p>, <p>[.....]</p>, <p>He eventually stopped before Aoife who seemed to have lost her words. Fear had completely overtaken her.</p>, <p>That was when Julien, no, Azarias finally opened his mouth to speak.</p>, <p>[.....The foundation of all masterpieces is a great start.]</p>, <p>Just like in the tryouts, his words flowed smoothly from his mouth, delivered with an even and calm tone.</p>, <p>Yet, beneath the calmness lurked a hint of madness, subtly veiled but discernible in the slight tremor that accompanied certain words.</p>, <p>It sent chills down the spines of the audience.</p>, <p>Aoife too felt the same way as she looked up at Azarias, feeling all hints of Julien disappearing from him. She truly was... standing before a psychopath.</p>, <p>'Ah, this...'</p>, <p> The fact that she found it so hard to speak was perfect proof of this.</p>, <p>He was simply...</p>, <p>Overwhelming.</p>, <p>[All artists crave to create their own masterpieces. I'm no different.]</p>, <p>His face changed subtly as he looked around.</p>, <p>He seemed to be talking to someone. Emily? The audience?</p>, <p>[I want to make a masterpiece. A piece that will be synonymous with my name.]</p>, <p>...Or himself?</p>, <p>Lowering his head, he stared at his hands.</p>, <p>They were trembling. In the silence that took over after his last words, he raised his head to stare at Aoife who suddenly lost her breath.</p>, <p>How could...</p>, <p>[....And so, the first brushstroke of this masterpiece shall be none other than your life itself.]</p>, <p>For the first time since the start, his expression morphed completely.</p>, <p>His chest started to heave up rapidly, while the trembling of his hands became more pronounced.</p>, <p>From where they were seated, the audience could tell exactly what he was feeling.</p>, <p>\"Excitement.\"</p>, <p>Delilah muttered unknowingly.</p>, <p>Before she knew it, she too had become absorbed with the play. Usually, these types of things bored her. Who would've thought?</p>, <p>'It's interesting...'</p>, <p>Not only the acting but the storyline. Even now she didn't understand the reasoning for why Azarias acted the way that he did.</p>, <p>It was indeed clear that he was a psychopath, but even psychopaths had certain goals and motivations.</p>, <p>She was sure that Azarais had his own reasoning for his actions.</p>, <p>But what exactly was his motivation?</p>, <p>Pleasure?</p>, <p>[Akh...! Akh!]</p>, <p>The expected death scene came soon enough.</p>, <p>With both hands gripping Aoife's throat, he squeezed down at her. Many of the audience members turned away from the sight that was before them.</p>, <p>There wasn't much noise, but the sight spoke volumes to what was happening.</p>, <p>[Ukh... Hel-p!]</p>, <p>The struggle continued as Aoife swayed her hands and scratched Julien's arms. Even then, her struggle was futile.</p>, <p>[Kh! Akh!!]</p>, <p>Gradually, her movements slowed down, and her face turned purple.</p>, <p>The sight was heartbreaking. Especially when one saw the utter sense of helplessness her face had.</p>, <p>Until...</p>, <p>She limped over.</p>, <p>[.....]</p>, <p>Azarias remained still, his hands still gripping at her throat without saying a word.</p>, <p>Finally, he let go of her.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>And she slumped to the ground.</p>, <p>[Haaa.... Haa....]</p>, <p>The sound of his rough breathing echoed throughout as he stood in silence, his head lowered to stare at the lifeless body.</p>, <p>It became clear to the audience that his breathing wasn't rough because he was tired, but because of something else...</p>, <p>Madness.</p>, <p>A clear-cut madness that was on the very urge to consume him.</p>, <p>And then...</p>, <p>Clank. Clank. Clank.</p>, <p>The rushed sounds of footsteps echoed. All of a sudden, several figures appeared on the other end of the alley.</p>, <p>Four, five?</p>, <p>Wearing armor, they appeared to be knights.</p>, <p>At the exact moment they appeared, Julien's head turned and he came face to face with them. No, he was smiling...? The corners of his lips gently pulled up, twitching slightly as he eventually let out a soft chuckle.</p>, <p>[So, you're here.]</p>, <p>It was a laugh that contained both mockery and disdain. At that, the audience tilted their heads to question.</p>, <p>'He was expecting them?'</p>, <p>'....What's going on? Why does it seem like he is already aware of the fact that they were coming?'</p>, <p>All of a sudden, Azarias's gaze turned hollow as the madness that was threatening to spill out started to really spill out from him.</p>, <p>It was a sight that chilled the ears of the audience.</p>, <p>Immediately, one of the knights lunged at him, swinging their sword down.</p>, <p>Clank--!</p>, <p>The loud metallic sound echoed throughout as the blade came into contact with the hard ground.</p>, <p>'What's going on?'</p>, <p>The audience was stunned by the loud sound of the sword. For a brief moment, they thought that he had swung for real.</p>, <p>But in reality, the knight had truly swung for real.</p>, <p>'.....They're starting.'</p>, <p>The only one who wasn't stunned was Julien who stared at the approaching knights with an indifferent gaze. Facing them, he could tell that there was something wrong with their gaze. It lacked any substance, seeming rather detached.</p>, <p>'They've come for her.'</p>, <p>It was obvious that their target was Aoife who was slumped on the ground behind.</p>, <p>Shiiing—!</p>, <p>Unveiling a dagger he kept hidden, Julien faced the knights.</p>, <p>As he did, a genuine smile spread across his lips. It wasn't a fake smile. But one that came from deep within him.</p>, <p>[Ha-]</p>, <p>He pointed the dagger forward and whispered his lines.</p>, <p>[....A supplementary piece to my masterpiece.]</p>, <p>Thin, almost imperceptible threads sneaked out of his forearm, moving down on the ground and moving towards the knights.</p>, <p>With their senses numbed due to whatever state they were in, Julien was able to get the threads to circle around their ankles and arms.</p>, <p>The process took no longer than a couple of seconds and in no time, the knights rushed towards him.</p>, <p>[Hahaha!]</p>, <p>A laugh escaped Julien's lips as he took a step back and avoided an incoming slash.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>He ducked and avoided the next.</p>, <p>His movements were fluid, almost seamless as he evaded all the attacks with a certain grace.</p>, <p>Staring at the scene, some of the members of the audience gripped tightly against the armrest of their chair. The choreography was spectacular, with the slashes narrowly avoiding him each time.</p>, <p>If only they knew that everything was currently being orchestrated by Julien.</p>, <p>Pulling the threads at just the right moment, he was able to slightly alter the course of the attacks at the right moments, orchestrating everything as he saw fit.</p>, <p>Such a scene was only caught by a few individuals in the audience as they frowned.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Dodging another attack, Julien's lips trembled as he came face to face with one of the knights. He swung his dagger, and...</p>, <p>Puchi!</p>, <p>Blood sprayed out.</p>, <p>Suddenly, a burst of red broke through the gray monotony, creating a stark contrast that teased the eyes of the audience.</p>, <p>Staring at it, Azarias's lips trembled even more. A strange wave of excitement was coursing down his mind. More... He wanted more. The madness that engulfed him started to consume him as his face twisted.</p>, <p>Puchi! Puchi!</p>, <p>[More....!]</p>, <p>Red splashed across the gray world.</p>, <p>In his madness, Azarias seemed to have lost himself as he continued to stab and slash. His expression twisted into one of inexplicable pleasure, reminiscent of a child gleefully playing with a new toy.</p>, <p>Slash. Slash. Slash—!</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>Unable to take the scene, some of the audience members covered their mouths and whispers started to follow.</p>, <p>\"He's not actually killing them, right?\"</p>, <p>\"It can't be...\"</p>, <p>\"But why does it feel so real?\"</p>, <p>The audience wasn't the only one that thought this was real. The writers and organizers were seemingly lost in the performance.</p>, <p>\"This... Are you sure they're acting?\"</p>, <p>\"That.\"</p>, <p>Olga looked at the stage in a trance. Although she felt that something was wrong with the scene, she couldn't take her eyes away from Azarias.</p>, <p>He was...</p>, <p>\"Perfect.\"</p>, <p>The scene was...</p>, <p>\"Perfect.\"</p>, <p>Everything was...</p>, <p>\"Perfect.\"</p>, <p>There were no other words she could use to describe what she was seeing. To perfectly encapsulate the madness, as well as the ecstasy that he felt from his actions... It was just perfect.</p>, <p>The only ones who knew that something was wrong were the more powerful individuals who frowned at the sight.</p>, <p>\"Is this some sort of new method of acting?\"</p>, <p>They could tell at a glance that the slashes were real.</p>, <p>Delilah too could tell as she closely examined Julien. He appeared to be lost in his madness as he continued to manipulate the knights with his threads.</p>, <p>It wasn't the first time that she had seen them, but seeing how he had used them to cleverly manipulate the knights to move as he wished, Delilah was impressed.</p>, <p>What an interesting power...</p>, <p>\"....It should be fine.\"</p>, <p>The only reason why nobody reacted was because none of his slashes appeared lethal. Rather, they were all superficial.</p>, <p>[Hahaha!]</p>, <p>With each slash, he delved deeper into madness, losing himself further. The once-gray world gradually transformed, tainted by spreading red.</p>, <p>It was an uncomfortable sight.</p>, <p>Especially when...</p>, <p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>, <p>[Haa...]</p>, <p>It became hard to tell whether he was acting or not.</p>, <p>Standing still at the center of the alley, his head gradually lowered and the world froze.</p>, <p>The entire time... Another person was present.</p>, <p>It was none other than Joseph who had seen the entire scene from where he stood. Julien's presence had been so overwhelming that almost everyone had forgotten about him.</p>, <p>[.....]</p>, <p>An unsettling, almost suffocating silence ensued shortly after.</p>, <p>With his gaze directed toward Azarias, the detective's hoarse voice broke the silence that gripped the frozen world.</p>, <p>[...It was you.]</p>, <p>Cli Cla—</p>, <p>The lights turned off shortly after.</p>, <p>It lasted for a few seconds before they turned back on.</p>, <p>When the lights returned, the scenery had changed. No longer was the world gray, and Azarias was long gone.</p>, <p>Joseph was now back in the flower shop.</p>, <p>The vision had ended.</p>, <p>Standing in the middle of the flower shop, he remained silent for a few seconds.</p>, <p>[Haa.]</p>, <p>As he took a deep breath, his body trembled. It was clear to the audience that he had been affected by what he had seen.</p>, <p>They similarly understood where he was coming from.</p>, <p>What they had just seen...</p>, <p>It was hard for anyone to swallow.</p>, <p>But it wasn't over yet. Now that he had found the culprit, he had to go.</p>, <p>[....I have to go.]</p>, <p>Although he said that, he didn't move.</p>, <p>It became clear to everyone that his body was refusing to move. Fear had taken over his mind.</p>, <p>[I need to go.]</p>, <p>Only when he repeated the same words over and over again did he finally exit the flower store, and trace his steps back to the familiar house.</p>, <p>The moment he reached the door, he was surprised to see it already open.</p>, <p>[Elbert.]</p>, <p>He called out for his assistant but got no response back.</p>, <p>Taking another deep breath, he stepped into the house. He needed to act calm. Azarias didn't know that he knew he was the culprit.</p>, <p>Or so he thought...</p>, <p>[Ah...]</p>, <p>Entering the house, Joseph's steps stopped as his body froze.</p>, <p>It wasn't just him. The entire audience froze too as they stared at the man who stood by the center, a figure lying motionlessly beneath him.</p>, <p>Casually rolling up his sleeves, Julien looked directly at Joseph, no, the audience, and smiled.</p>, <p>[....You're finally here.]</p>, <p>The final act had begun.</p>]\n",

Silence enveloped the space as everyone's gaze remained fixed on the man standing at its center. With just his presence, he sucked the attention of all those watching.</p>, <p>His lips twisted into a smirk, his expression filled with nothing but pleasure as he stared at them.</p>, <p>It was sickening.</p>, <p>\"He's a psychopath...\"</p>, <p>\"He didn't kill him for real right? This is acting, right?\"</p>, <p>None of the audience could find the right words to describe the scene they had just witnessed.</p>, <p>It was brutal and hard to stomach.</p>, <p>They looked around the room and held their stomachs. The once-gray world now bled red, saturating nearly every corner.</p>, <p>[I... What have you done?]</p>, <p>It was Joseph's voice that broke the silence. Yet again, he had been forgotten by the audience who had been so absorbed by the man standing opposite him.</p>, <p>Turning their attention towards Joseph, they could see his shoulders shaking.</p>, <p>His gaze was directed towards his assistant whose eyes were closed.</p>, <p>[You...]</p>, <p>[Do you like what I've drawn?]</p>, <p>Azarias's voice trembled slightly as his eyes gazed at the audience. For some reason, it felt as though he was looking at every one individually.</p>, <p>It sent shivers down the spines of some of the audience members, causing them to swallow nervously.</p>, <p>[Y-you're crazy. A monster.]</p>, <p>Joseph's words echoed the thoughts of all those watching.</p>, <p>His voice was smooth, and the audience could see the emotions contained in his tone. From anger to sadness.</p>, <p>It was all so vivid.</p>, <p>If only they knew...</p>, <p>Such were the true emotions Darius was feeling as he stared at the cadet before him. He was simply overwhelming.</p>, <p>It was taking every ounce of his experience to keep up.</p>, <p>[A monster]</p>, <p>Azarias curiously tilted his head as he swapped his gaze between him and the painting on the wall.</p>, <p>[Do you not like it? Is something missing?]</p>, <p>[....]</p>, <p>[Tell me.]</p>, <p>Gradually, Azarais's face started to twist.</p>, <p>[Is something missing?! Tell me!]</p>, <p>His powerful voice bellowed throughout the entire theater as some of the audience members flinched at the unexpected change.</p>, <p>His desperation was made clear to the audience.</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>[What is it missing? What? I've done it well. It's good. There's not-]</p>, <p>Bang.</p>, <p>Azarias's voice stopped.</p>, <p>Looking down, he stared at his clothes where a small hole appeared. Gradually, red started to stain his clothes.</p>, <p>[Ah...]</p>, <p>In the silence that suddenly took over, he looked up.</p>, <p>Joseph met his gaze.</p>, <p>His expression was twisted as his body trembled. Pointed at him was the barrel of a small gun.</p>, <p>[...]</p>, <p>With trembling lips, Joseph stared at Azarias. His expression contorted as his face showed nothing but hatred and disgust.</p>, <p>Thud—</p>, <p>Azarias's body fell shortly after.</p>, <p>In the gray world, he stared blankly at the ceiling as red began to stain his shirt, pooling around him and seeping toward the wall where he had painted.</p>, <p>Joseph's figure faded out of frame as all that remained was Azarias and the painting on the wall.</p>, <p>Gradually, the red coming from his body connected with the wall.</p>, <p>In the last moments, Azarias looked at the wall. His previously ecstatic expression changed.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>What replaced it was a blank look. It was as if his breath was being taken away from him.</p>, <p>The audience held similar expressions as they stared at the painting on the wall.</p>, <p>It was a rose.</p>, <p>A thorny rose.</p>, <p>One that slowly connected with Azarias who lay on the opposite end. The rose now had a stem, symbolizing his integration into the painting.</p>, <p>It all clicked then.</p>, <p>[S-so that's what was missing...]</p>, <p>There was something poetic about the rose that the audience had a hard time describing.</p>, <p>Especially within the monochrome world. It stood out, and almost felt blinding, making one unable to take their gaze away from it.</p>, <p>And then...</p>, <p>Drip.</p>, <p>As something dripped down the corner of Azarias's eyes, his quiet voice still managed to reach the ears of all those present.</p>, <p>[It's... so beautiful.]</p>, <p>In death, he basked in the only color that gave meaning to his life.</p>, <p>It was...</p>, <p>A masterpiece.</p>, <p>His masterpiece.</p>, <p>Cli Cla—</p>, <p>The lights turned off.</p>, <p>A Colorless World.</p>, <p>Such was the name of his final Act.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>While Julien was performing. Before the final act.</p>, <p>Backstage.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>Sparks flew as a sword met against another. Swiftly twirling his sword against another's, Leon twisted it down and brought his fist forward, hitting his opponent right in the face.</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>\"Ukh!\"</p>, <p>He followed up his attack with another.</p>, <p>With a swift and decisive blow, his opponent fell down face flat against the ground.</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, Leon looked around. There were a total of four people lying down on the ground unconscious.</p>, <p>Wearing knight uniforms, they were part of the actors that were supposed to show up on stage. He had been waiting for them at the back, in an area where the staff couldn't see.</p>, <p>At the same time, he made sure to use as little mana as possible when fighting against his opponents.</p>, <p>Given the powerful individuals sitting in the theater, he knew that his actions would alert them.</p>, <p>For that reason, he held himself back to a certain degree. Thankfully, he was a knight and he could fight without mana.</p>, <p>It was for that reason that he was able to suppress them.</p>, <p>\"Where are they?\"</p>, <p>\"Where did they go?\"</p>, <p>In the distance, he could hear the frantic voices of the staff as they looked for the remaining members of the knight groups.</p>, <p>\"Weren't they just here? What happened?\"</p>, <p>\"Agh...!\"</p>, <p>In the end, they ended up sending the remaining knights to the stage where Julien was.</p>, <p>\".....You should be able to take care of the rest.\"</p>, <p>They weren't particularly strong.</p>, <p>At least, they shouldn't prove to be much of a struggle for Julien.</p>, <p>And he was proven right.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Coming out of the room after he made sure that they had all been properly taken care of, Leon headed backstage to stare at Julien's performance.</p>, <p>It was hard to describe.</p>, <p>The brutality and madness of his gaze carved itself in his mind and the minds of all spectators.</p>, <p>It was a chilling sight.</p>, <p>One that closely reminded him of a certain past.</p>, <p>Staring at the scene, a figure overlapped Julien's and his lips pursed as he mumbled something inaudible.</p>, <p>Cli Clank—</p>, <p>The stage turned dark, and the scene ended.</p>, <p> In the brief interlude, the background started to fade as the relic used to project the background shifted towards the next scene.</p>, <p>Glancing around, Leon headed towards where the bodies lay and placed a small salt over their nose, jolting them awake.</p>, <p>\"Uh!? Ah, what's going...\"</p>, <p>As expected, the moment they were jolted awake, they acted as if they didn't understand what was going on.</p>, <p>\"Akh, this...!\"</p>, <p>\"Ah!\"</p>, <p>Their faces twisted as the pain from the stabs sunk in, and as Leon glanced around to see the staff quickly clean the 'fake' blood, he covered their mouths and beckoned them to follow him.</p>, <p>\"Follow me.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, because of Julien's performance, none of the staff thought weirdly of their actions.</p>, <p>They were all too busy setting up the next scene and attending Julien.</p>, <p>In the meantime, they treated their 'shock' as something that came with Julien's overwhelming performance.</p>, <p>Plus...</p>, <p>Given the unapproachable aura that Leon was giving off, none dared to go near him.</p>, <p>It was for this list of reasons that Leon was able to get them to follow him without anyone suspecting a thing. But even if they did, Leon didn't particularly care.</p>, <p>The higher-ups were most probably already aware of the fact that something had happened.</p>, <p>It was for that reason that he didn't put much effort into hiding the fact that something had gone wrong.</p>, <p>The only reason he helped them out was because he needed to closely monitor them.</p>, <p>In case they lost their minds again, he'd be ready to act before they'd be able to do anything.</p>, <p>Looking back, and seeing that they were still confused, he nudged them with his chin.</p>, <p>\"Follow me, I'll bring you to treat your wounds.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Following Azarias's death, the play continued.</p>, <p>It turned out that Emily, the baker's daughter was actually an illegitimate member of the royal family, and her death had caused several chains of events to start.</p>, <p>It was a fact that Joseph came to learn too late as he was suddenly entangled in a large set of conspiracies.</p>, <p>The story was filled with intricate twists and turns that would normally capture the audience's attention.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>[You may persecute me as guilty, but here I stand, in all my glory, declaring my innocence!]</p>, <p>Nobody could truly focus on the play.</p>, <p>In the back of their mind, the previous performance continued to replay within their mind. From his gaze to the last scene. All their minds could think of was about Azarias's last act.</p>, <p>To the point where the colors before them started to feel uncomfortable.</p>, <p>They just... Seemed out of place.</p>, <p>This continued until the end of the play where it took several seconds for the audience to notice. What followed was a modest round of applause.</p>, <p>Clap. Clap. Clap—</p>, <p>As the claps went on and people snapped out from the performance, only then did the genuine claps burst forth and discussions began.</p>, <p>\"Wow...\"</p>, <p>\"That was insane.\"</p>, <p>Several of the audience members found themselves hugging their arms as they talked about the performance.</p>, <p>It was thrilling and mesmerizing.</p>, <p>From the plot twists to the storyline. Everything was perfect. But even then, a certain performance took it to the next level.</p>, <p>\"Chills. I still feel chills.\"</p>, <p>It was Julien's performance.</p>, <p>He had taken over the minds of all the spectators.</p>, <p>[Let's welcome our lead actor, Darius Johns who plays the role of Joseph.]</p>, <p>Within the claps, a crisp voice echoed through. It was the voice of the organizer who started to introduce the actors.</p>, <p>Clap. Clap. Clap—</p>, <p>Stepping up onto the stage, Darius was welcomed by a warm wave of applause.</p>, <p>\"Amazing!\"</p>, <p>\"Well done—!\"</p>, <p>[Next up, let's welcome our lead actress, Odette Ripley who plays the role of Amelia Wilnie.]</p>, <p>Clap. Clap. Clap—</p>, <p>\"You were amazing!\"</p>, <p>\"I love you, Odette!\"</p>, <p>\"Your acting was phenomenal. I'll continue to follow you until the end!\"</p>, <p>The claps continued as one actor after another entered the stage. One by one they entered the stage and bowed with smiles on their face.</p>, <p>To the actors, such a scene was something that they had grown used to. However, to the cadets who had played the 'extra' roles, the scene felt overwhelming.</p>, <p>Especially for Aoife who stepped up on stage and heard the thunderous applause that was directed towards her.</p>, <p>\"Amazing!\"</p>, <p>\"You were great!\"</p>, <p>\"You killed it!\"</p>, <p>Taking in the praise, Aoife found herself struggling to keep herself from showing any emotion. Clenching her fists, she felt her heart prick with a certain emotion.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, she thought back to all her efforts over the past week.</p>, <p>How she had reduced her sleep, and the constant headaches she had to ignore just to perfect her role.</p>, <p>Seeing the looks of the audience, Aoife felt that it was all worth it.</p>, <p>That her efforts had been worth it.</p>, <p>And then...</p>, <p>[Next up, let's welcome our next actor. Playing the role of Azarias, let's welcome Julien Evenus.]</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The moment his name was called out, the claps stopped and the stage fell silent.</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>Shattering the silence was his calm step as Julien's figure emerged from behind the stage.</p>, <p>At that moment, all eyes fell on him.</p>, <p>He was different from the man from before.</p>, <p>The madness that he contained before was long gone, and what replaced it was a stoic and detached look that seemed fitting to that of a high-ranking noble.</p>, <p>The difference was to the point where the audience was starting to question whether they saw the same person.</p>, <p>Within the silence, whispers started to spread.</p>, <p>\"Are they really the same person...?\"</p>, <p>\"Why does he seem so different?\"</p>, <p>Such stark contrast in demenour threw a lot of the audience members off. All but a certain few who knew him.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Staring at him from her seat, Delilah didn't say anything.</p>, <p>Gradually, her eyes closed and her lips pulled up.</p>, <p>\"Not bad.\"</p>, <p>Truly.</p>, <p>Not a bad performance.</p>, <p>And in that moment, the claps returned.</p>, <p>Clap! Clap! Clap—!</p>, <p>The audience erupted in applause as they centered their attention on the calm man at the heart of the theater who took the applause for granted.</p>, <p>Almost as if he knew they belonged to him.</p>, <p>\"You were amazing!\"</p>, <p>\"I can't believe I've got to witness something like this!\"</p>, <p>One by one, the members of the audience stood up and the applause intensified. At the center of it all, Julien looked around and lowered his head as if to express his gratitude.</p>, <p>\"Amazing!\"</p>, <p>\"Great...!\"</p>, <p>The applause was overwhelming, surpassing that which any other actor had received.</p>, <p>\"....Wow.\"</p>, <p>Standing in the middle of the stage, Aoife looked at the audience. She could tell that the applause was directed towards Julien.</p>, <p>That all of this was because of him...</p>, <p>And in that moment, staring at the man who was standing beside her, she raised her hand and followed the audience.</p>, <p>Clap. Clap—</p>, <p>Because she too had been captured by his acting as the audience had.</p>, <p>Even in her jealousy, Aoife had to admit.</p>, <p>He was great.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Coming back to my dressing room, I sat down exhausted and took a deep breath. Recalling the claps from the audience, I felt like smiling.</p>, <p>It felt gratifying to see that so many people had appreciated my performance.</p>, <p>It was unfortunate that I couldn't quite enjoy the feeling for too long.</p>, <p>\"Ah....\"</p>, <p>I clenched my chest as I took another deep breath.</p>, <p>It wasn't as if I was exhausted, but the emotional toll that the skill had taken over my mind wasn't something that I could get rid of quite easily.</p>, <p>\"Huh... Huh...\"</p>, <p>Even now, my chest trembled as I tried to rid myself of the ecstasy that I was feeling.</p>, <p>It was hard, but I was still in control.</p>, <p>Most of it was because I was able to run rampant on the stage.</p>, <p>If not for that, my struggle would've been worse.</p>, <p>In the midst of my recovery, my mind couldn't help but wonder about the feelings that I was currently experiencing.</p>, <p>\"Joy... Joy... Ecstasy. Excitement.\"</p>, <p>I found myself repeating the same words over and over again.</p>, <p>\"Joy... Ecstasy... Excitement.\"</p>, <p>It felt as if I was on the verge of grasping something important about my powers. A breakthrough.</p>, <p>\"When I think about it, even though what I felt were ecstasy and excitement, my experience increased for 'joy'.\"</p>, <p>What did that mean?</p>, <p>What was joy? It wasn't simply happiness. There was more to it, and it became apparent to me after reading Alexander's mind.</p>, <p>'The same must be true for the other emotions.'</p>, <p>There were six basic human emotions.</p>, <p>Love, fear, anger, joy, sadness, surprise.</p>, <p>However, when thinking carefully, there existed a further classification.</p>, <p>More fundamental ones that branched from the six main ones.</p>, <p>\"Anger, wrath, fury...\"</p>, <p>I found myself immersed in my thoughts as I suddenly felt a more concrete direction to head with my emotive magic.</p>, <p>An idea suddenly entered my mind.</p>, <p>\"What if instead of making someone just sad, I can target something more concrete? Maybe like...\"</p>, <p>I paused before muttering,</p>, <p>\"....Guilt?\"</p>, <p>I opened my eyes wide at the realization.</p>, <p>\"Wait, this can work.\"</p>, <p>If I were to delve more deeply into this, then I was sure I could further deepen the power of my Emotive Magic.</p>, <p>\"Yes, this can—\"</p>, <p>To Tok—</p>, <p>Halting all thoughts, I turned to look at the door with a frown.</p>, <p>Who could it be?</p>, <p>I wasn't expecting any guests.</p>, <p>'Perhaps, it's Leon?'</p>, <p>I had still not heard from him yet. The last time I had seen him was just before the last act, right as he led the 'knights' away from the stage.</p>, <p>\"Haaa.\"</p>, <p>Either way, I stood up and opened the door, expecting a familiar set of gray eyes to greet me.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>But contrary to my expectations, what greeted my sight was an unfamiliar pair of yellow eyes.</p>, <p>My heart dropped.</p>, <p>Looking up slightly, a calm voice echoed out.</p>, <p>\"....It's nice to see that you're doing fine, Phecda.\"</p>]\n",

Looking at the man who stood before me, it felt as if all the hair on my body stood.</p>, <p>He was...</p>, <p>'Very strong.'</p>, <p>Too strong for me to imagine.</p>, <p>Just standing before him felt suffocating.</p>, <p>But it wasn't his power that got me.

It took every ounce of my willpower to stop my heart from beating faster. I was afraid he'd notice. Thankfully, I was quite adept at controlling my emotions.</p>, <p>Looking around, I found a spare seat and sat down.</p>, <p>Massaging my face, I mumbled,</p>, <p>\"The performance took a toll on me.\"</p>, <p>\"Ha...\"</p>, <p>With a subtle chuckle, the man nodded.</p>, <p>\"That's understandable. You've always had a hard time controlling your emotions. It must've felt great to finally let go for once, right? I almost saw your old self in there.\"</p>, <p>\".....Yes.\"</p>, <p>Just faintly, I felt my heart skip a bit.</p>, <p>I was walking on thin ice. Extremely thin ice. One wrong step, and I felt everything would shatter.</p>, <p> But...</p>, <p>Within the danger, there was also opportunity.</p>, <p>'So the real Julien acted like that...?'</p>, <p>Information.</p>, <p>It was a great opportunity for me to learn about the previous Julien and the organization that I was dealing with.</p>, <p>But before that, I knew that I was far from the clear.</p>, <p>And as expected, in the next moment, the atmosphere turned extremely oppressive as I lost my breath.</p>, <p>\"I've been wondering for quite a while, Phecda, but why is it that you've been acting on your own recently?\"</p>, <p>My entire body tensed at his question.</p>, <p>\"....From your interference with the professor to everything else that came after. You've been meddling a little too much, no?\"</p>, <p>While his voice came out calm, I could feel the underlying rage hidden within his words as the air felt even more suffocating.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>For a brief moment, I struggled to speak.</p>, <p>\"Well?\"</p>, <p>It was hard to speak when it felt as though a massive boulder was resting over my chest.</p>, <p>Gritting my teeth, I forced my head up to stare and meet his gaze.</p>, <p>Finally, I spoke.</p>, <p>\"You should know why.\"</p>, <p>The atmosphere froze then. With my head raised, I kept my focus on his intense yellow eyes that stared back at me with a certain coldness that made me shiver.</p>, <p>Just as I noticed that his lips were about to part open to speak, I cut him off and continued.</p>, <p>\"She's been watching my every movement. She suspects me. For that reason, I can't contact anyone.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"I've helped when I could, but there's a limit to how much I can do before my identity is compromised.

It was for this reason that I was able to act rationally.</p>, <p>I was merely following the script I had prepared in my mind.</p>, <p>\".....But don't get me wrong. I've helped when I was able to. You should be aware of what happened at the prison.\"</p>, <p>I pointed towards myself.</p>, <p>\"I was the reason they were able to escape. I'm sure you of all people should be able to confirm this.\"</p>, <p>It was true, and also a calculated risk that I had taken.</p>, <p>From the moment that I realized that the previous Julien was part of the organization, I knew that something like this was bound to come.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I took the calculated risk of failing the quest mission.</p>, <p>I knew that it was important to have allies within the organization. For that, I helped out the Professor. But that wasn't the only reason. The other reason was because I knew that something like this was coming.</p>, <p>I needed a sort of alibi to prove that I was still doing things to help the organization.</p>, <p>It was a risk I was willing to take to make my story more believable. And I was starting to believe I had made the right choice.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Seeing that the sense of oppression that was lingering in the room was disappearing, I knew that my story was working.</p>, <p>I finished my speech with a question.</p>, <p>\"I did interfere in several missions, but the damage that I've caused is meaningless on the grand scope of things, am I not right?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Yet again, he remained silent as his yellow pupils traced over my body.</p>, <p>Silence gripped the room as I felt his gaze on me. Silently swallowing my saliva, I stared back at him without moving my gaze away.</p>, <p>It felt suffocating, but I knew that I couldn't look away.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>The entire time, he remained silent, without saying a single word. From where I sat, I couldn't tell what he was thinking or what he was feeling.</p>, <p>He just had an air of detachment.</p>, <p>But the silence didn't last for long. Opening his mouth, he finally spoke again.</p>, <p>\"How is your relationship with her?\"</p>, <p>The air instantly felt lighter and I secretly sighed in relief.</p>, <p>\".....Shouldn't you already know?\"</p>, <p>A smile finally spread across his features.</p>, <p>\"I know, but I still want to ask.\"</p>, <p>\".....It's nothing concrete just yet.\"</p>, <p>The subject of the matter was none other than Delilah.</p>, <p>Given that the organization seemed to have eyes everywhere, I believed that they knew about how she had been keeping a close watch on me.</p>, <p>I chose to use that to my advantage and make it seem as though I was laying low so that I wouldn't be discovered while at the same time building a relationship with her.</p>, <p>It proved to be the right decision.</p>, <p>\"I can't tell at all what she's thinking. For now, it seems like she's keeping me close to observe me. My movements are limited. You should understand why I am doing what I'm doing.\"</p>, <p>\"I know.\"</p>, <p>\"Then why did you send those knights after me?\"</p>, <p>\"Ha...\"</p>, <p>With another smile, the man slowly stood up.</p>, <p>\"Call it a warning. I just wanted to see the extent of your commitment to your new role.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I looked at him wordlessly.</p>, <p>See the extent of my commitment to my new role?</p>, <p>What did he mean by this?</p>, <p>\"There's no need to be so displeased. I only used mild hypnosis on them. They shouldn't have posed a threat to you, to begin with. On the bright side, it spiced up the play, didn't it?\"</p>, <p>This bastard...</p>, <p>\"For now, keep doing what you're doing. What you told me is more or less in line with what I've been suspecting. If you need any help, you can always reach out to me. Otherwise, I will find a new way to contact you. Report to me everything that you notice with her.\"</p>, <p>Heading towards the door, the man turned around and our eyes met again. Though his smile appeared warm, all I felt were chills.</p>, <p>\"Keep up the good work, Phecda.\"</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>The room fell silent again after his departure.</p>, <p>But even as he left, I remained tense. It felt as though I had years shaved off of my life at that moment.</p>, <p>Our talk had only lasted for a few minutes, but it had felt like an eternity to me.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>It was only after a few more minutes had passed that I finally let out a long breath and let my body relax.</p>, <p>\"...Fucked.\"</p>, <p>My situation was fucked.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>Someway, somehow, I was able to bullshit my way through it.</p>, <p>Even so, things were far from over. This was merely the start. I knew that much. Things were going to become a lot more problematic for me in the future.</p>, <p>Despite that, I wasn't afraid.</p>, <p>Gradually, my strength was increasing, and so was my awareness of my situation.</p>, <p>In the future, I planned to make full use of my circumstances to achieve my goals. It was for this reason that I needed to remain patient.</p>, <p>My time was coming, and all I needed was a little bit more time.</p>, <p>[The Final Act: You have overcome the event.]</p>, <p>The expected notification finally came as my vision flashed.</p>, <p>[You were able to prevent Aoife from getting targeted during the play, stopping her from getting seriously injured.]</p>, <p>■ Game Progression EXP + 6%</p>, <p>Game Progression : [0%-[7%]100%]</p>, <p>■ Character Progression EXP + 39%</p>, <p>Exp : [0%—[11%]100%]</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and let the power seep into my body.

            "[<p>\".....Is this them?\"</p>, <p>Entering a certain room, Delilah glanced around before settling her gaze over the bodies sprawled on the floor. They weren't dead, but judging from the bruises on their bodies, they were obviously passed out.</p>, <p>\"Did you detect anything?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Standing up, a man with blonde hair and green eyes, Dr. Gabel Wright, lazily rubbed his hair.</p>, <p>\"There's no trace of any spell being used on them.\"</p>, <p>Pinching his fingers together, which were currently covered by a blue glove, he rubbed them together.</p>, <p>\"I believe Xyron powder was used. It's a rather weak hallucinat that can be used to turn people into mindless zombies for several hours.\"</p>, <p>The Doctor looked up to meet Delilah's gaze.</p>, <p>\"....Of course, when I mean weak, I mean that it doesn't affect those that have reached a certain strength. I'd say above Tier 3.\"</p>, <p>Dr. Gabel went on the give Delilah a more detailed description of what the drug did.</p>, <p>In the end, his assessment was,</p>, <p>\"It's good that it was taken care of before they could go out. Either way, this was no accident. That's probably pretty obvious to you already. While I am unsure who, I don't think their goal was grand. My best bet is that they were giving a warning, or testing something.\"</p>, <p>Mumbling to himself while pinching his chin with his hand, he frowned.</p>, <p>\"....But I could just be overthinking. It's just that I have a hard time thinking they'd try anything big when you take into account that Xyron powder only turns them into mindless people who can hardly think for themselves. Even the weakest mage can take care of them.\"</p>, <p>Standing by the side, Delilah didn't say anything and just listened to the doctor's analysis.</p>, <p>But if one paid close attention, they'd notice a slight curl at the end of her lips.</p>, <p>'Finally.'</p>, <p>They had made a move.</p>, <p>She had been waiting for quite a while now, and it proved to be the right gamble.</p>, <p>The organization that she had been hunting for the past years, and had trouble looking for, had finally stepped away from their burrows. At the center of it all was a young cadet that she had taken as an assistant.</p>, <p>While they were probably aware of the fact that she had their eyes on him, they were probably also planning on using him as a means to monitor her movements.</p>, <p>Delilah was fine with that.</p>, <p>It was a game of patience, and Delilah was confident in her patience.</p>, <p>Whether she'd be able to get them to slip up, or she slipped up, Delilah was willing to gamble.</p>, <p>Because...</p>, <p>She had that much confidence in her strength.</p>, <p>\"So as I was saying, we should take some time to properly investigate the situation. I believe that if news gets out that-\"</p>, <p>Clank--</p>, <p>Cutting the doctor's words off, the door to the room opened and a figure walked in.</p>, <p>Immediately, the atmosphere around the room changed. It wasn't oppressive, but there was a certain air of regality and nobility that made one want to bow down before them.</p>, <p>Turning her head, Delilah made contact with the man.</p>, <p>His yellow pupils immediately stood out to her as he returned her gaze with a smile.</p>, <p>\"I'm done on my end.\"</p>, <p>Closing the door behind him, he walked in and scanned the room, briefly pausing his gaze on the four cadets on the floor.</p>, <p> \"Xyron Powder, am I right?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Stunned, the doctor looked at him. Atlas chuckled in return.</p>, <p>\"The ones that did make it out to the stage also were affected by the powder.\"</p>, <p>\"They were...?\"</p>, <p>The sudden revelation stunned the doctor who blinked his eyes repeatedly.</p>, <p>\"Haha, yeah. You probably didn't notice, but we all did during the play. I got several questions asking me whether something had happened. I had to tell them that it was all merely part of the act and a new way of 'method' acting.\"</p>, <p>\".....Is this true?\"</p>, <p>Turning his head, the doctor faced Delilah who blinked her eyes once before nodding.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, this...!\"</p>, <p>\"There's no need to worry.\"</p>, <p>Atlas reassured in a calm tone.</p>, <p>\"They're being taken care of by others. They are currently unaware of what happened to them. A talented cadet had noticed that something was off during the play, and had the cadets escorted away to keep an eye on them.\"</p>, <p>\"Is that so?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Delilah watched the entire exchange from the side.</p>, <p>The entire time, her gaze wandered over to Atlas. He was an enigma to her.</p>, <p>As a member of the Megrail family, a very high-ranking member at that, one that could compete for the throne, he chose to work at Haven.</p>, <p>It was a choice that didn't make sense.</p>, <p>While it was also true that people thought the same way about her, she had also made her ambition rather clear.</p>, <p>'We don't have much time.'</p>, <p>The speed at which the Mirror Dimension was expanding was rapidly increasing each year, and Delilah knew that it wouldn't take long before the entire world was swallowed up.</p>, <p>For this reason, she chose to work at Haven.</p>, <p>With her strength, she wanted to help out and nurture the future generation.</p>, <p>It was also because of her ambition that she stood on the opposite end of the Megrail family.</p>, <p>Their tyrannical laws that stunted the growth of the younger generation were something that she wanted to be removed at all costs.</p>, <p>For them to survive in the future...</p>, <p>She had no choice but to oppose them.</p>, <p>And for that very reason, Delilah treated Atlas with the utmost caution. Was he here to monitor her, or did he have another goal in being here?</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>As if sensing her gaze, he turned his head and their gazes met.</p>, <p>\"Ah, right. You want to know about Julien, right? I had a talk with him like I told you before.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"He is doing fine. There are no injuries on him. He said he was a little startled by the situation, but hardly noticed it because he was so immersed in his role. Thinking about it, he did a wonderful job.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"In any case, you don't have to worry about him. He doesn't seem to be involved in this matter.\"</p>, <p>\".....I see.\"</p>, <p>Delilah quietly nodded her head. Keeping her usual composure, she took one last glance at the bodies beneath before heading out of the room.</p>, <p>She felt uncomfortable in Atlas's presence.</p>, <p>Even though he was weaker than her, he gave off an unpleasant feeling.</p>, <p>Passing by him, she heard a few parting words from him.</p>, <p>\"I heard he's your assistant. Do take care of him. He's quite talented.\"</p>, <p>Those were the last words she heard before leaving.</p>, <p>As she left, her lips gently opened as she quietly mumbled.</p>, <p>\"I know.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The Festival was an event that hosted many attractions. In particular the play, and the combat experience by the cadets.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, due to some circumstances, it was postponed by the Academy for the next month. While some of the guests were understandably annoyed, there was nothing they could do about it.</p>, <p>....And with that, the festival neared its end.</p>, <p>\"Haaa....\"</p>, <p>It was dark outside, and I sat on a bench. Leaning against it, I stared at the night sky. It was filled with stars, and the moon shone brightly.</p>, <p>The sight was one that always took my breath.</p>, <p>In the last moments of my life, the only thing that I remember seeing was the ceiling lights of the hospital room.</p>, <p>The air I now breathed felt refreshing. A stark contrast to the stifling one in the hospital room.</p>, <p>Every day, I'd just take a few moments to appreciate what I once took for granted. It was weird, but losing everything made me understand just how important the little things were to me.</p>, <p>\"....A dumb thought.\"</p>, <p>\"What is?\"</p>, <p>A figure appeared beside me all of a sudden. When I turned my head, I saw Leon standing on the other end of the bench.</p>, <p>With his hands in his pockets, he similarly stared at the moon.</p>, <p>\"I took care of the ones that were probably going to give you a hard time.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>He turned his head.</p>, <p>\"A word of thanks?\"</p>, <p>I tilted my head.</p>, <p>\"Aren't you my knight?\"</p>, <p>\"I am.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\".....I'm thinking of resigning.\"</p>, <p>\"What a pity. I'm not paying for your severance fee.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>None of us said another word as the surroundings were engulfed in silence. I thought it'd be like that until one of us spoke again, but strangely, the silence was shattered by Leon who covered his mouth with his hand.</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Was this guy...</p>, <p>\"Are you laughing?\"</p>, <p>For some reason, just faintly, my lips pulled up into a smile.</p>, <p>There was something about Leon holding his laugh back that felt contagious. Shaking my head, I looked up at the sky again.</p>, <p>It was Leon who spoke first.</p>, <p>\"You're different compared to him.\"</p>, <p>\"I know.\"</p>, <p>It became clear to me after my last talk.</p>, <p>\".....You know what he told me the last time I told him I would quit?\"</p>, <p>\"What did he say?\"</p>, <p>\"Nothing, he just slapped me.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Blinking, I looked back to Leon.</p>, <p>\"Should I have done that too?\"</p>, <p>\"You can try.\"</p>, <p>\"Hmm...\"</p>, <p>I thought about it for a good second before shaking my head.</p>, <p>\"I'm not into that stuff.\"</p>, <p>It's definitely not because I was afraid he'd slap back.</p>, <p>Staring at me for a brief moment, Leon shook his head and leaned back on the bench. As his smile started to fade, he started to speak.</p>, <p>\"Do you miss it?\"</p>, <p>\"Miss it....?\"</p>, <p>Miss what?</p>, <p>\"Home.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Home... Right, I had one. Or did I?</p>, <p>Thinking back, I never truly had a home. I wasn't rich enough to be able to afford a proper one. I was only able to rent a small studio apartment while I paid for my brother's education.</p>, <p>The reality of the matter was that I had no home.</p>, <p>But even so.</p>, <p>\"I do.\"</p>, <p>Because my home was wherever my little brother was.</p>, <p>\"....Is that so?\"</p>, <p>I turned to look at Leon.</p>, <p>\"What about you?\"</p>, <p>It had been a while since I knew him, but in actuality, I hardly knew anything about him. Besides the fact that he was my knight, he was a complete enigma to me.</p>, <p>I was a little curious.</p>, <p>\"Do you miss your home?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>At first, Leon didn't say anything. I thought I had touched a sour spot, but just as I was about to speak again, he spoke over me.</p>, <p>\"I don't remember.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>\"I see it sometimes. When I sleep.\"</p>, <p>\"In your dreams?\"</p>, <p>\"....Yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded his head.</p>, <p>\"My youngest memory is that of when I first joined the Evenus household when I was young. I think I was ten, or twelve. Been a while now.\"</p>, <p>\"Is that how you met Julien?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Frowning, Leon continued,</p>, <p>\"He was a lot milder back then. He used to smile a lot and was quite talented. He was the pride of the family.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...?\"</p>, <p>Leon's voice changed, lowering a bit.</p>, <p>\".....He changed.\"</p>, <p>Right. That much I expected.</p>, <p>\"It wasn't a quick change. It happened gradually. Over the years. I told you before, but he used to smile a lot. At some point, he stopped smiling, and he turned into a completely different person.\"</p>, <p>With a subtle laugh, Leon shook his head.</p>, <p>\"....And just as I had started to get used to his new self, he changed again.\"</p>, <p>Turning his head, our eyes met.</p>, <p>\"You came along.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Right, I did.</p>, <p>I opened my mouth to reply but closed it a moment later. In the end, I didn't really know how to reply to that.</p>, <p>\"Don't worry.\"</p>, <p>Eventually, Leon shook his head and stood up.</p>, <p>\"I'm not interested in trying to find a way to bring the old Julien back. He's probably long gone. Maybe it's good that way.\"</p>, <p>Brushing his hair, he took one last glance in my direction.</p>, <p>\"I didn't expect our conversation to spiral this way. Originally, I was just planning on telling you about the situation with the cadets that you took care of. In the end, I ended up rumbling about myself. I'll leave now.\"</p>, <p>He was just about to leave when his steps halted.</p>, <p>From the tilt of his head, he appeared to be struggling to say his words until eventually, he lowered his head to mutter.</p>, <p>\"....It was a great performance.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>And then he truly left.</p>, <p>Did he just...</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>Staring at his back which slowly started to fade from my view, I shook my head and looked up at the sky.</p>, <p>It was at that moment that my chest prickled slightly. The emotions from the performance were still lingering in my mind.</p>, <p>They weren't as pronounced, but they were clearly there.</p>, <p>\"Emotions, huh.\"</p>, <p>I think...</p>, <p>I was slowly starting to understand them.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Volume [1] - End</p>, <p>A rather short volume, but it was the introductory volume for the story.

            "[<p>The festival came to an end.</p>, <p>Haven's educational department had its hands full with dealing with the aftermath of postponing the mid-term exams. With the Exams used as a means to assess cadets for the draft, their annoyance was understandable.</p>, <p>Each year, the Guilds only had one chance to pick a new recruit. For that reason, they needed to pick the right one.</p>, <p>A mistake could cost them their future for the next few years. Hence why it was important for them to gather as much information and data as possible before the draft began.</p>, <p>In the end, however, despite their protests, Haven refused to budge and they remained firm with their decision.</p>, <p>On another note, there was a certain piece of news that was starting to spread within the Empire.</p>, <p>The Empire Daily — Breaking :</p>, <p>[The Enigma of Midnight Manor] has risen to claim the coveted 5-star rating as the Empire's latest sensation in the theater!</p>, <p>In a stunning display at Haven, the judges were left utterly mesmerized by the play. Brimming with complex plot twists and surprises, it held its audience spellbound throughout.</p>, <p>However, if there was one standout performance, it undoubtedly belonged to the Black Star of Haven, Julien Dacre Evenus. A dark horse in the Jovinc award! Will he be able to make it?</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Putting the newspaper down, I took a deep breath.</p>, <p>\"The Jovinc award...\"</p>, <p>I had been made aware of it just a few moments ago. Apparently, it was a very prestigious acting award. As the clips of the play started to spread, my voice started to spread, and all of a sudden, I had become a candidate to win the 'Best Supporting Actor' award.</p>, <p>It was rather burdensome.</p>, <p>However, thinking about the money that I would receive from the award...</p>, <p>—I also place my vote on him. He was phenomenal. Some of the best acting that I've ever seen. Julien D. Evenus.</p>, <p>I started to push the narrative.</p>, <p>'.....I need the money, so.'</p>, <p>I placed my vote down and sent it to the post office.</p>, <p>I was just coming out of the post office when a figure appeared in front of me. The two of us stooped at the same time.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>For a brief moment, silence ensued.</p>, <p>The first one to break the silence was Aoife who alternated her gaze between me and the post office.</p>, <p>\"Were you placing down your vote?\"</p>, <p>\".....Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I looked down at Aoife's hand where a small letter was nestled. For some reason, she seemed to be fiddling with it. Perhaps she was embarrassed with her choice?</p>, <p>\"You're also placing a vote?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah... Yes.\"</p>, <p>Seeing how her eyes avoided me at all times, it was perhaps true that she was embarrassed by her choice.</p>, <p>I was just about to leave when she asked,</p>, <p> \"....Who did you vote for?\"</p>, <p>My face twitched at her question. Keeping myself composed, I looked straight into her eyes before saying,</p>, <p>\"You.\"</p>, <p>\"....Uh?!\"</p>, <p>As if not expecting such an answer, her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"I felt like you did a good job. I can tell that you've put a lot of effort into your role. It was impressive.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah...\"</p>, <p>Just slightly, her body trembled and her head lowered. I couldn't see her expression, but I took that moment to leave.</p>, <p>'It's not like I lied...'</p>, <p>Well, the part where I voted for her was indeed a lie.</p>, <p>But outside of that, her acting had truly been great. I could see that she had put a lot of effort into it.</p>, <p>I didn't want to take that away from her.</p>, <p>'.....I'll vote for her next time.'</p>, <p>If the opportunity presented itself.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Even as Julien left, Aoife remained standing on the spot with her head lowered. Even now, she was struggling to understand what had happened.</p>, <p>Recalling her previous conversation with him, Aoife found herself clenching her fists.</p>, <p>\"Me...\"</p>, <p>His words. They were a form of acknowledgment.</p>, <p>Acknowledgment of her efforts. It made her body flush with heat. It had been a long time since she had felt like this. The joy of knowing that someone was acknowledging her efforts.</p>, <p>Even if it came from the unlikeliest of people, no, perhaps it was because it was him that Aoife felt the compliment meant more.</p>, <p>He was clearly better than her.</p>, <p>He was the star of the show and someone who was probably going to win the award.</p>, <p>For him to tell her that he had voted for her...</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>It was enough to make her laugh. Especially when she looked at the letter in her hand.</p>, <p>—I thought she was great. Captured my attention. I place my vote on her. Aoife K. Megrail.</p>, <p>Thinking about it now, it was shameless of her. For her to vote herself...</p>, <p>\"....I thought no one would vote for me.\"</p>, <p>Given Julien's performance, she thought she'd be without any votes.</p>, <p>But who would've thought...?</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>Staring at the letter, Aoife let out a long sigh.</p>, <p>It dawned on her how shameless her actions were. Aoife hated to admit it, but she had to be more mature about this.</p>, <p>\"He was great.\"</p>, <p>Way better than her.</p>, <p>And for that reason...</p>, <p>Riiiip—!</p>, <p>Aoife ripped the letter apart.</p>, <p>\".....It was immature of me.\"</p>, <p>Moving toward a nearby table, she wrote a new letter. In it, she wrote.</p>, <p>—The only possible winner. Julien D. Evenus.</p>, <p>Once she was done writing, she folded the paper and placed it in the letter which she then handed over to the post office.</p>, <p>\"Thank you for using our services.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Coming out of the post office, Aoife stared at the sky. She felt liberated. To her, the acknowledgment of her effort meant a lot more than a single vote. Especially since that vote came from herself.</p>, <p>Thinking about her actions, she started to feel secondhand embarrassment.</p>, <p>\"....How shameless.\"</p>, <p>For her to even think about voting for herself...</p>, <p>Aoife shook her head.</p>, <p>\"Pathetic.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The days passed like that.</p>, <p>With the upcoming examinations, a serious atmosphere took over the Academy. The once bustling place was now empty as the training grounds and library became full.</p>, <p>It was to the point where they became overcrowded. Such places started to become impossible to frequent.</p>, <p>Thankfully, I studied at my dorms most of the time.</p>, <p>In the next two weeks, I followed the same routine.</p>, <p>Take lessons, study back at the dorm, train my spells, and train the blue-ranked book. My progress wasn't anything fast. At least, not compared to how it had been in the past.</p>, <p>However, it was certainly better than nothing.</p>, <p>More than anything, I was just waiting to see what would happen once my spell reached the next level.</p>, <p>Would they evolve? If so, how...?</p>, <p>\"Ugh.\"</p>, <p>Stretching my body, I rubbed my haggard face and closed the book before me.</p>, <p>\"....Feels like I'm back at my job.\"</p>, <p>There were so many things that I needed to memorize and understand. It was awful, but I had no choice but to do it.</p>, <p>The mid-terms were important.</p>, <p>Not only would failure mean expulsion, but the ranks would be re-adjusted. That meant that I could very well lose my position as the Black Star.</p>, <p>I couldn't allow that to happen.</p>, <p>The position was very important. While so far it had yet to do much for me, I knew just how important the 'name' was to the Guilds and outsider organizations.</p>, <p>For that reason, I had no choice but to indulge myself in my studies and practice.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Standing up to stretch my body, I suddenly paused and looked towards the corner of the room.</p>, <p>There, a black box rested.</p>, <p>Thinking about the box, I frowned. It had been a while since I had opened it. No, rather, I hadn't touched it ever since coming to Haven.</p>, <p>Stepping forward, I headed for the box and bent down.</p>, <p>Click—!</p>, <p>With a 'click' the box unlocked and I pulled the lid upwards. Instantly, my gaze rested on the sword that rested within.</p>, <p>\".....It's been a while.\"</p>, <p>Right, I still have the sword with me. The one that had punctured my chest the very first time that I came into this world.</p>, <p>I still didn't understand why that had happened, or for what reason the sword had been imbedded in me, but if there was one thing that I was sure about it was the fact that the sword was important.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Tracing my fingers over its body, I could tell just how sharp it was.</p>, <p>\"It's a very high-quality sword.\"</p>, <p>That much was true at first glance.</p>, <p>Placing my hand around the hilt of the sword, I tried to lift it, but...</p>, <p>\"....Hmm.\"</p>, <p>It was heavy. Really heavy.</p>, <p>\"Ugh.\"</p>, <p>It took both of my hands for me to be able to even lift the sword up.</p>, <p>\"What the hell...\"</p>, <p>I didn't remember it to be so heavy.</p>, <p>\"Ugh.\"</p>, <p>The more I tried to move with the sword, the more I found myself struggling. How can a sword be so heavy?</p>, <p>In the end, unable to hold for any longer, my grip faltered and the sword clattered on the ground.</p>, <p>Clank. Clank. Clank.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Catching my breath, I looked at the sword with a frown.</p>, <p>How could anyone hold a sword that heavy?</p>, <p>\"Is this the difference between a mage and a knight?\"</p>, <p>If so, it became clear to me that the sword would be of no use to me. I sort of expected for this to happen so I wasn't disheartened.</p>, <p>\"Hmmm.\"</p>, <p>But a thought suddenly crossed my mind.</p>, <p>\"What if I injected mana into the sword?\"</p>, <p>What would happen then?</p>, <p>I was quick to put my thoughts into action as I went on to grab the hilt of the sword and channeled my mana into it.</p>, <p>\"Ha...!\"</p>, <p>Almost instantly, the sword became lighter and I was able to lift it up. I had only done it to test it, but I hadn't expected it to work.</p>, <p>It was a pleasant surprise.</p>, <p>\"This is-\"</p>, <p>But the surprise was short-lived.</p>, <p>Blink.</p>, <p>With one blink, my surroundings changed. All of a sudden, I found myself standing on a rocky plain.</p>, <p>The landscape stretched endlessly in shades of bleak gray, with jagged formations rising and falling like the frozen waves of a turbulent ocean surface.</p>, <p>Above, the sun, though familiar, cast a hollow light, its shine muted by the heavy shroud of gloom that seemed to envelop everything.</p>, <p>Stunned, I looked around.</p>, <p>\"What's this...?\"</p>, <p>Blink.</p>, <p>Blinking again, I found myself back in my room.</p>, <p>And then...</p>, <p>Blink.</p>, <p>Back in the space.</p>, <p>Something gripped my heart all of a sudden as it started to beat dramatically. Looking around without blinking, I secretly swallowed my saliva.</p>, <p>\"Wh-wha...\"</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>The very fabric of the space around me started to twist as a hand slowly emerged from behind me, grasping my shoulder.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>As my head flicked in that direction, my heart stopped.</p>, <p>\"Ah, this...\"</p>, <p>With a wide smile, it looked at me.</p>, <p>As if the very fabric of space had wrapped around its face, I stared at the featureless creature.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>Ba... Thump! Ba... Thump!</p>, <p>I found the beat of my heart again.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\".....What do we have here?\"</p>, <p>The voice reached the depths of my mind, sending shivers down my entire body. It was rough, almost gravelly. As if a broom was scraping broken glass.</p>, <p>My skin crawled at the sound of it.</p>, <p>Blink.</p>, <p>The world around me changed again.</p>, <p>I was back in my room.</p>, <p>I kept my eyes firmly open. Something told me, no I knew that if I were to blink again, I'd be back in that world.</p>, <p>'....What was that?'</p>, <p>I questioned myself, staring at my surroundings as I felt sweat drop down on the wooden floor beneath me.</p>, <p>My pulse quickened, and my chest started to rise and fall rapidly.</p>, <p>....I felt my eyes burn.</p>, <p>What was happening?!</p>, <p>There were so many questions in my mind that I wanted the answer to. However, if there was one thing that I knew the answer to, then it was that whatever that faceless person was, it was dangerous.</p>, <p>Extremel-</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>My inner thought stopped the moment I noticed the fabric of the very space before me bend in the shape of a hand.</p>, <p>Blink.</p>, <p>The world changed again.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>All my instincts told me to run, and as I looked around the landscape before me, I felt a sense of helplessness as I realized.</p>, <p>All I saw were endless jugged rocks and mountains.</p>, <p>The air was cold and dry.</p>, <p>....There was nowhere for me to hide.</p>, <p>As if it could read my thoughts, a voice tickled my ears, sending shivers down my entire spine.</p>, <p>\"There's nowhere for you to hide.\"</p>, <p>Blink.</p>, <p>I blinked again, in hopes of getting away again, but...</p>, <p>\"That won't anymore. I've temporarily locked the space around us.\"</p>, <p>I remained in the world.</p>, <p>Blink. Blink.</p>, <p>Regardless of how hard I tried, I found myself unable to return back. Panic started to settle within my mind, but amidst the panic, I forced myself from showing any of it.</p>, <p>I couldn't allow fear to overtake my mind.</p>, <p>\"Hmm, your mind is rather resilient.\"</p>, <p>The space before me folded, unveiling the faceless figure from before. Though I couldn't see its true appearance, I could tell that whoever the figure was, it belonged to a man.</p>, <p>Bedding the fabric of space as if it were a plastic wrap, he walked around me, closely observing me. Or more like sensing me?</p>, <p> It was hard to describe.</p>, <p>....From the way he moved, it didn't really seem as though he could actually see me. It was more like he could sense my presence.</p>, <p>Or was I overthinking things?</p>, <p>Either way, I refrained from making any irrational movement.</p>, <p>\"You're a cautious one, aren't you?\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>The space next to me folded and a hand grasped onto my shoulder.</p>, <p>When did he...?</p>, <p>\"Your heart is beating rather fast. Are you nervous?\"</p>, <p>I swallowed my saliva.</p>, <p>\"Oh? It's beating even faster now... Did my words scare you?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"There's no need to be scared. I can't truly harm you. We're too far apart. The best I can do is seal the space for a few minutes. I just sensed a familiar smell coming from you. An intriguing one.\"</p>, <p>His gaze lowered towards the sword in my grasp where he leaned and sniffed slightly.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Yes, a familiar smell.\"</p>, <p>In the blink of an eye, he was next to the sword, tracing his finger over its body.</p>, <p>\"It feels the same length, but...\"</p>, <p>With a sudden pause, the faceless man looked up.</p>, <p>\"....It's been used. Hmm.\"</p>, <p>As if understanding something, the faceless man smiled.</p>, <p>\"What an interesting thought.\"</p>, <p>His words confused me, but even as they did, I remained silent. My instincts told me that the less I spoke, the better things were for me.</p>, <p>But even then...</p>, <p>\"Hmmm.\"</p>, <p>Appearing once again beside me, the hand went on to grasp my shoulder.</p>, <p>\"The Consortium.\"</p>, <p>His voice echoed within the surroundings. Listening to the words he spoke, I remained quiet.</p>, <p>In the off-chance that he could hear me, I didn't want him to memorize my voice, or possibly reveal something I shouldn't have.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"No? Doesn't ring a bell?\"</p>, <p>Looking a little disappointed, he continued.</p>, <p>\"Hmm, then... Nocturne Order?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Again, I kept my mouth shut.</p>, <p>He continued.</p>, <p>\"Inverted Sky.\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, the atmosphere became oppressive.</p>, <p>My thoughts froze but I refrained from making any movements or sounds.</p>, <p>How did...</p>, <p>Just as I thought he had picked up something, he went on to say a different name.</p>, <p>\"Stygian Cabal?\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>He didn't notice anything?</p>, <p>I was just about to sigh in relief when he let go of my shoulder and muttered,</p>, <p>\"You must be in the Nurs Ancifa Empire.\"</p>, <p>My mind blanked at that moment. It was as if all thoughts had been stripped away from my mind, preventing me from thinking at all.</p>, <p>How...?</p>, <p>How did he know?</p>, <p>I had been quiet the entire time, so... How?</p>, <p>....I was able to hear the answer shortly after.</p>, <p>\"The Consortium, Nocturne Order, Inverted Sky, Stygian Cabal...\"</p>, <p>Listing the names again, he continued,</p>, <p>\"They're the name of the organizations that I created.\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Yet again, my eyes widened.</p>, <p>But if that wasn't enough, the man continued.</p>, <p>\"Each organization lies within one of the Empires. To the world, they are different, but to me, they're all the same. Why do you think I've named them differently?\"</p>, <p>I swallowed my words but knew the answer.</p>, <p>'Because it's easier to figure out who is from who...'</p>, <p>\"Because it's easier to figure out who is from who.\"</p>, <p>As if he could read my thoughts, he muttered the same words I muttered in my mind. All I felt were chills as sweat unknowingly started to build up by the side of my face.</p>, <p>The air felt suffocating, and I had to take each breath carefully.</p>, <p>\"....It would've been problematic had you not known the name. However, there's still enough information for me to work with.\"</p>, <p>Casually blinking away, he appeared before me, walking around leisurely as he started to speak.</p>, <p>\"The way we operate between each Empire is different. You see, we don't want to feel too similar between each Empire, do we?\"</p>, <p>Pausing, he pinched his chin.</p>, <p>\"Making them think they're all the same would defeat the entire point, wouldn't it?\"</p>, <p>He flicked his head to face me.</p>, <p>\"Between the four Empires, we made sure that within two, everyone, be it the commoners or high-ranking nobles knew about the organization.\"</p>, <p>I was quick on the uptake there. I instantly understood what he was trying to say, but even so, I remained silent as I listened to his words.</p>, <p>While I wasn't exactly sure why he was saying all of this, I knew that he had a goal in all of this.</p>, <p>For that very reason, I just listened and took in every word carefully.</p>, <p>\"Had you not known any, then you were merely likely going to be a citizen of one of the other two Empires. The ones where we made sure to keep the organization under wraps with only a few knowing.\"</p>, <p>Suddenly, his empty smile widened.</p>, <p>\".....You knew about the Inverted Sky. I felt it from the beat of your heart. That's the name of the organization that resides within the Nurs Ancifa Empire. And the fact that you know means that you're at least a noble. Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Falling into thought, the faceless figure walked around. The entire time, he exuded a demenour of casualness.</p>, <p>However, staring at him, I could only feel utter dread.</p>, <p>My entire body shivered under his presence as notifications flashed before my very eyes.</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 1. [Fear] EXP + 0.1%</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 1. [Fear] EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>They just continued to flash before my eyes.</p>, <p>Never before had I experienced such terror in my life. Not even when I had first used my powers.</p>, <p>This was just...</p>, <p>Overwhelming.</p>, <p>\"What are you thinking about?\"</p>, <p>A soft whisper tickled my ear again as he appeared right beside me. I felt my body twitch at his touch. But even as I tried to distance myself from him, I found that my body refused to budge, almost as if it was glued on the spot.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>He appeared in front of me again. This time, with his wrist raised in a way that made it seem as though he was checking his time.</p>, <p>\"Well, it looks like we're running out of time.\"</p>, <p>His head turned, and I met his empty face.</p>, <p>\"Just so you know, I can't hear nor see you. I can only sense you. But you probably already figured that out.\"</p>, <p>Lowering his wrist, he smiled yet again as he pointed toward the sword in my hand.</p>, <p>\"I'll be needing that real soon. Keep it well. I'll be coming for it soon.\"</p>, <p>Blink.</p>, <p>Blinking once, he appeared just a few centimeters away from me.</p>, <p>\"....Oh, and don't think about running away.\"</p>, <p>My entire body tensed at his appearance. And especially his smile.</p>, <p>\"You'll never be able to escape me.\"</p>, <p>Blink.</p>, <p>The scenery changed again.</p>, <p>This time, I was back in my dorm.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>But even so, I held my breath back and looked around me. Touching the sofa, I made sure to check if everything was real.</p>, <p>For some reason, even though I knew that it was, I still felt the need to check.</p>, <p>I went on like this for ten minutes before sitting down on the sofa and setting the sword down.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I sat there without saying a single word.</p>, <p>Looking down, I saw that my legs were still tensed. My jaw too... Every part of my body was tense. Even as I looked around me and saw that nobody was present, there was still this nagging feeling at the back of my mind that made me grow wary.</p>, <p>Finally, I had found my voice.</p>, <p>\"What just happened?\"</p>, <p>It sounded unfamiliar to my mind as it came out hoarse.</p>, <p>\"Where was I...? And why did he tell me everything?\"</p>, <p>It made no sense. For what reason would he...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>....But it also clicked inside of my mind.</p>, <p>The reason why he told me everything like that.</p>, <p>I covered my mouth and felt chills run down my body.In the chance that I was to spill everything out, then...</p>, <p>\"He'll have a concrete idea of who I am.\"</p>, <p>It was a trap.</p>, <p>A carefully interwoven trap that one wouldn't be able to notice were they not paying extreme attention.</p>, <p>And the sense of dread that I felt intensified.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>I leaned back and stared at the empty ceiling.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, I felt the energy drain away from my body. Glancing at the sword that rested beside me, I had the urge to suddenly throw it away.</p>, <p>What if he could detect its presence and find it? What if...</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>I covered my eyes with my forearm.</p>, <p>The feeling that the faceless man gave off... It was one of utter helplessness. It felt as if there was nothing that I could do to stop him.</p>, <p>The fleeting sense of control that I had so desperately clung to in the past... It was utterly gone.</p>, <p>In its place was only helplessness.</p>, <p>Just who in the world was he?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"The Midterms will be starting next week. I do hope that everyone is prepared for them. During the first week, we'll have your theoretical examination.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette's voice echoed throughout the otherwise silent classroom.</p>, <p>\"After that, we will be moving to the combat-related examinations. I hope that all of you are ready for what is to come. There will be a lot of people, scouts included. They will be closely examining your performances.\"</p>, <p>She was currently giving us a brief rundown of the upcoming exams.</p>, <p>\"It is important that you do your best during the examinations. Not only will you receive a new rank, but you will also have an evaluation given by the scouts who will use the information for the draft.\"</p>, <p>It was just general knowledge. I more or less knew most of the information that was being given. But even then, I didn't have it in me to pay attention to any of the words that she was saying.</p>, <p>The only thing that was running through my mind were thoughts about the faceless man.</p>, <p>Who was he?</p>, <p>No... I already had an idea of who he was. The leader of the Inverted Sky. But... Not just that. He was also the leader of several other organizations that resided within the other Empires.</p>, <p>The sheer idea of the power that he held sent shivers down my spine.</p>, <p>Not only was his influence in this Empire but in the other Empires too. What sort of concept was this?</p>, <p>I desperately wanted to do some research on the organizations that he had named, but I refrained from doing so.</p>, <p>That... also felt like a trap.</p>, <p>Knowing just how powerful the Inverted Sky was, I could tell that he had eyes and ears everywhere.</p>, <p>One wrong move and I was likely going to expose myself.</p>, <p>I needed to tread carefully.</p>, <p>\"Ah, this...\"</p>, <p>Yet again, this sense of helplessness...</p>, <p>The worst part of this was that I knew what his target was.</p>, <p>The sword.</p>, <p>'I shouldn't have activated it.'</p>, <p>It was the whole reason why he was able to detect me.</p>, <p>Had I not...</p>, <p>'No, it was bound to happen.'</p>, <p>One day, or another, I was going to do the same thing. It was something that was bound to happen. But...</p>, <p>'....If only I had done it a little later.'</p>, <p>I knew that it was too late for me to regret it. For now, the only thing I could do was find a way to buy as much time as possible.</p>, <p>The only thing that he knew was the Empire I was from, and that I was a noble.</p>, <p>I was still in the clear.</p>, <p>What he didn't know was the fact that I was part of that very organization.</p>, <p>At least, on paper.</p>, <p>That meant that I only had one true path to take.</p>, <p>'Have more control within the organization.'</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p> Suddenly hearing my name getting called up, I raised my head. When I looked around, I found that everyone was staring at me.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I remained quiet and waited for the Professor to speak. I had been too immersed in my own thoughts. I had no idea what was happening.</p>, <p>\"Who are you going to choose?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Choose?</p>, <p>I blinked my eyes.</p>, <p>I had to choose? Choose what?</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>As if understanding that I wasn't paying attention, Professor Bridgette sighed and shook her head.</p>, <p>\"Never mind, I will select your team members for you.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Looking around the classroom, the Professor's gaze fell on several people.</p>, <p>\"Your team members will be, Anders, Kiera, Luxon, and Josephine.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>It turns out that for the midterms, the combat sequence was divided into two parts. Team, and individual performance.</p>, <p>According to the Professor, cadets needed to know how to work well together.</p>, <p>It was one of the traits that the Guild's scouts looked forward to the most given that they sent extraction teams into the Mirror Dimension all the time.</p>, <p>For that reason, a draft prospect needed to know how to work and lead in a team, outside of their individual power.</p>, <p>To Guilds, powerful cadets were useless if they didn't know how to work together with other members.</p>, <p>At the training grounds.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>\"Stop it.\"</p>, <p>\"Haaa....\"</p>, <p>\"I said stop it.\"</p>, <p>\"Haaaa-Hiek!! Stop! I'm sorry!\"</p>, <p>Ignoring Kiera and Josephine who were bickering with one another, a sight which had started to become the norm within the classroom, I took a look at the other two cadets in my team.</p>, <p>'Anders and Luxon.'</p>, <p>Both were ranked rather high.</p>, <p>....I knew Anders a little. Ever since the incident back in the forest, he had mellowed out a lot.</p>, <p>Rather, you could say he was on friendlier terms with me.</p>, <p>Even so, it wasn't as if I was extremely familiar with him.</p>, <p>The only one that I wasn't very familiar with was Luxon. With brown hair and blue eyes, he was rather handsome. Last I recalled he was also ranked five, and a knight.</p>, <p>A powerful team member.</p>, <p>No, all of them were strong. I couldn't complain about the team composition.</p>, <p>\"Uht!! H-help!\"</p>, <p>There was only one problem.</p>, <p>\"Are you dissatisfied with something?\"</p>, <p>Luxon didn't seem to be satisfied with the current arrangement. He appeared to be the only one like that as he had been wearing a frown ever since we left the classroom and came into the training area.</p>, <p>Turning his head, he met my gaze.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Though he didn't say anything, I could tell at a glance what his problem was.</p>, <p>'So it's me.'</p>, <p>Right...</p>, <p>\".....I don't like this.\"</p>, <p>His deep voice echoed throughout. Though it wasn't loud, it was enough to stop Kiera and Josephine by the side.</p>, <p>\"What's going on?\"</p>, <p>Ignoring her, he continued.</p>, <p>\"Since this is a decision made by the Professor, I won't argue. I'm just stating that I don't like this arrangement.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>As expected, I was right.</p>, <p>It wasn't as if I hadn't expected such a scenario. In fact, I had thought that everyone on my team would be in disagreement with the current arrangement, but it was surprising to see that he was the only one who was displeased.</p>, <p>\"What do you want to do about it?\"</p>, <p>It was a simple question.</p>, <p>One that wasn't filled with any malice.</p>, <p>But deep down, I already knew what he wanted. Still, he shook his head and turned his head.</p>, <p>\"Nothing. Since the arrangement is like this, I won't argue.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh? You seem rather reasonable.\"</p>, <p>It was surprising, but at the same time, it made sense. He was a high-ranking noble who had been trained to enter a Guild.</p>, <p>While he had his pride, he knew the importance of teamwork.</p>, <p>A rather impressive person.</p>, <p>\"....Do you want to spar?\"</p>, <p>It was for that reason that I offered to spar with him.</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Perhaps taken aback by my sudden proposition, everyone looked at me. I could also feel Kiera's gaze from the side, but compared to Josephine's and Luxon's expressions, hers contained a different meaning.</p>, <p>Ignoring it, I continued.</p>, <p>\"If you're dissatisfied, then I have no problem sparring with you.\"</p>, <p>I didn't mind it to be honest.</p>, <p>There was something that I wanted to test. It was something that I had discovered during the play and hadn't had the chance to properly test it.</p>, <p>A new ability perhaps.</p>, <p>I wasn't quite sure what to make of it just yet.</p>, <p>But it was certainly an interesting idea...</p>, <p>As if still stunned by the sudden proposition, Luxon's gaze changed.</p>, <p>\"...You, are you being serious?\"</p>, <p>\"Serious.\"</p>, <p>Unbuttoning the buttons of my shirt, I slowly rolled my sleeves up and tossed my blazer to the side.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Still stunned, he remained motionless on the opposite end.</p>, <p>But I didn't care and started to stretch my body.</p>, <p>'Rank five...'</p>, <p>Though his rank was high, it was mainly due to the fact that Kiera wasn't very good at academic studies. She was in fact stronger than him. The same was true for a few other cadets.</p>, <p>In terms of raw combat power, he was within the tens.</p>, <p>Even so...</p>, <p>He was certainly strong.</p>, <p>My strength had increased quite a lot over the past few months due to everything that had happened to me.</p>, <p>I wanted to test the extent of my skills.</p>, <p>.....and the new technique that I was trying to grasp.</p>, <p>\"Are you ready?\"</p>, <p>Once my sleeves were fully rolled up, I looked in his direction. He too had removed his blazer and had rolled up his sleeve.</p>, <p>In his hand was a wooden sword.</p>, <p>When did he get that...?</p>, <p>\"How are we going to do this?\"</p>, <p>At his question, I looked at the space around me and massaged my shoulder.</p>, <p>\".....It's a light spar. Just enough to familiarize ourselves and to please you.\"</p>, <p>\"And the victor?\"</p>, <p>\"Naturally he'll be the leader.\"</p>, <p>\".....Okay.\"</p>, <p>Positioning himself in a stance, a thin veil of mana started to cover his body.</p>, <p>\"I'm ready.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Nodding quietly, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>'Let's see how this goes.'</p>, <p>There was a high chance it could backfire, but I didn't really care about that. I was more interested in knowing if it was possible.</p>, <p>And thus...</p>, <p>With my eyes closed, I immersed myself in a familiar set of emotions and memories.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>As Luxon and Julien stood on opposite ends, Kiera, Anders, and Josephine spectated from the side.</p>, <p>\"This is so exciting~\"</p>, <p>With her body leaning forward, Josephine alternated her gaze between Julien and Luxon.</p>, <p>\"As expected, nobody can beat Julien in that department...\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Kiera looked at Josephine in confusion.</p>, <p>What's this bitch ranting on about?</p>, <p>\"But, hey.\"</p>, <p>Josephine's head turned to face hers.</p>, <p>\"Who do you think will win?\"</p>, <p>\"....Who?\"</p>, <p>The obvious answer was Luxon, but...</p>, <p>\"I don't know.\"</p>, <p>Kiera didn't feel so confident in him. It was strange, but she just didn't see him winning against Julien.</p>, <p>\"Anders?\"</p>, <p>Turning her head, Kiera saw that Anders was also silent. Judging from his expression, he seemed to have similar thoughts to her.</p>, <p>Would you look at this...</p>, <p>Smirking slightly, Kiera reached out for her blazer pocket and took out a small box. Retrieving one out, she was just about to light it up when she stopped herself.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her gaze fixed on Julien who stood motionless with his eyes closed.</p>, <p>Feeling her hand grow antsy, she had the urge to light the cigarette. However, despite her mind telling her to, her body refused to.</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>In the end, clicking her tongue, she put the cigarette away.</p>, <p>'....Whatever.'</p>, <p>\"You, did you...\"</p>, <p>Her action seemed to have stunned Josephine who looked at her with widened eyes.</p>, <p>For some reason, Josephine's gaze annoyed her, and she pushed it away with her hand.</p>, <p>\"Go away.\"</p>, <p>\"But, you...!\"</p>, <p>\"Fuck, stop. It's starting.\"</p>, <p>Indeed, the moment Kiera said those words, Julien opened his eyes. However, the moment he did, the atmosphere around him completely changed.</p>, <p>\"What the...\"</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>A scratching sound echoed.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, a familiar figure appeared in their vision.</p>, <p>One that everyone present had witnessed once before. Be it live, or through recordings... Everyone was familiar with the figure that stood before them.</p>, <p>Especially when staring into his eyes which contained a hidden madness.</p>, <p>Opening her mouth, Kiera mumbled,</p>, <p>\"How does that make sense?\"</p>]\n",

How I had almost lost myself to Alexander's emotions.</p>, <p>.....It was there that the thought came.</p>, <p>'Can I copy their experiences and fighting styles?'</p>, <p>What if I were to immerse myself deeper into their characters? Not just their emotions, but their memories and fighting styles?</p>, <p>Would that work?</p>, <p>Staring at Luxon who stood on the opposite end, I closed my eyes and sank deeply into my thoughts.</p>, <p>I immersed my mind deeper and started to reconstruct a few parts of what I had seen after using the skill.</p>, <p>It was a backyard.</p>, <p>The world was gray, and there was no sound around.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>A boy stood in the middle, waving his daggers. With careful steps and movements, he practiced against a dummy.</p>, <p>Contrary to what one would expect, his movements and fighting style weren't chaotic.</p>, <p>Rather...</p>, <p>It was refined and minimalistic.</p>, <p>There wasn't much that I could work with. I only had a few memories. However, given how boring his life was, most of them were just about his training.</p>, <p>Just like Azarias...</p>, <p>His world was a colorless one.</p>, <p>Staring at his figure, I immersed myself in his image. I tried to picture myself in him.</p>, <p>Slashing the daggers, swords, and fists, taking the little steps, and avoiding the dummy. I mimicked everything in my mind.</p>, <p>Before I knew it, I was no longer watching, but I was the one doing the movements.</p>, <p>'Slash—!' I ducked down and slashed up. 'Slash—!' I sidestepped and avoided the counterattack.</p>, <p>'Slash—!'</p>, <p>The more this continued, the more I felt myself synchronize with the Alexander from my vision. From the way he moved his body, to the way he breathed. I copied it all.</p>, <p>To the point where,</p>, <p>I....</p>, <p>Was slowly becoming Alexander.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Opening my eyes, I felt a lot of my emotions numb down.</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>My neck started to itch.</p>, <p>The deeper I immersed myself in his emotions, the more I found myself picking up his traits.</p>, <p>Alexander was a dagger user. Such was the weapon of his choice. That being said, he could also use other weapons.</p>, <p>In my case...</p>, <p>Clank. Clank.</p>, <p> I still chose to stick to the chains and body.</p>, <p>.....While the memories were clear in my mind, they weren't enough for me to completely become him. It was good that way. Were I to completely lose myself in this deep sense of initiation that I was currently relieving, I wasn't sure whether I'd be able to return to who I was.</p>, <p>In fact, what I was doing was dangerous in itself.</p>, <p>I couldn't immerse too deeply into this. There was a very real risk of losing myself in the character.</p>, <p>What would happen if I lost myself in character?</p>, <p>What would become of me?</p>, <p>\"Are you ready?\"</p>, <p>Overhearing Luxon's voice, my chest trembled.</p>, <p>The world around me started to gradually lose all color. It was starting to become boring. No, it had already become boring.</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>It was such a monotonous world that made me crave for something.</p>, <p>For some color.</p>, <p>Staring at him, I nodded my head.</p>, <p>\"I'm ready.\"</p>, <p>Wooom—!</p>, <p>He appeared before me. In less than a few seconds, he had covered the distance that was between us.</p>, <p>On any normal occasion, I would've panicked a little.</p>, <p>But, now...</p>, <p>'Boring.'</p>, <p>I took a single step to the side, deftly avoiding the incoming slash.</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Briefly, Luxon appeared stunned. I took in his expression. Seared it in my mind as my lips trembled slightly.</p>, <p>Twisting my torso, I coiled the chain on my left hand and punched toward where I expected Luxon to be.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>As my fist drew near to his face, I felt my heart beat faster. Yes... Yes... Finally, something to break the monotonous shell that was my world.</p>, <p>Just as I thought my attack was going to hit, he disappeared and reappeared right behind me.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>The chains in my hand snaked around my arm, deftly moving towards my shoulder where a wooded sword appeared.</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>I felt an intense pain as the wooden sword smacked against my shoulder.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>I felt a wave of annoyance as our eyes met. Just in the nick of time, I had been able to protect my shoulder. But even so, I could tell that it was dislocated.</p>, <p>Boring... So boring...</p>, <p>Using my other hand, I stepped slightly and punched forward.</p>, <p>Swoosh.</p>, <p>That attack met nothing as Luxon appeared on the opening on the side of my body.</p>, <p>How weird...</p>, <p>As if I could tell what he was going to do next, I tilted my body slightly.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>The sword slashed in an upward direction, narrowly avoiding my nose. It was close. Extremely close. About a few millimeters.</p>, <p>Had I not been careful, I might've lost my nose.</p>, <p>But I couldn't care at all about myself.</p>, <p>Rather, I found something peculiar.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>I ducked down.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Stepped to the left.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Stepped to the right.</p>, <p>I could trace Luxon's movements.</p>, <p>Despite that, each time, I'd get hit. I felt pain engulf my mind, but I was used to pain. I didn't let it affect me.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Marks started to appear on my clothes as I avoided them, but I was slowly starting to get a hang of it, getting better and better at dodging.</p>, <p>Almost as if I was in a trance.</p>, <p>No, rather than trance, it was more like I was starting to be able to predict them. In this monotonous world... Everything felt bland. And as I delved deeply into Alexander's mind, I could see that Luxon's movements were similar to his.</p>, <p>Alexader's life was boring. In his life, one of the few means of entertainment for him was combat.</p>, <p>There was nothing he enjoyed more than seeing his opponent defeated and basking in the audience's praise.</p>, <p>It was for that reason that he spent a major part of his life just training.</p>, <p>So...</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Taking a slight step forward, I yet again avoided his attack.</p>, <p>Ba... Thump!</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>The more time passed, the more I started to grow accustomed to this new style.</p>, <p>It was still raw, but it was working...</p>, <p>I was gradually starting to mimic Alexander's movements perfectly. To the point where I slowly started to lose sight of myself.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>....And slowly, I indeed started to lose sight of myself.</p>, <p>\"More...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Luxon's opinion of Julien was rather mixed. While he did believe that he was weak and that he didn't deserve his rank, he also didn't dismiss his Emotive abilities.</p>, <p>They were in a league of their own.</p>, <p>But that said...</p>, <p>'So long as he doesn't touch me, I'm good.'</p>, <p>As far as he knew, Julien was only capable of voice transmission for [Sadness]. If one was ready, then defending against it wasn't impossible.</p>, <p>In that case, the only thing that he truly needed to worry about was the distance between the two.</p>, <p>He couldn't allow Julien to touch him.</p>, <p>And that...</p>, <p>'Shouldn't be a problem.'</p>, <p>Luxon was confident in his abilities. Just like Josephine, he had been trained in a knight's family. He was extremely proficient in the sword. Besides those 'monsters,' he was confident in handling everyone.</p>, <p>He was that confident in his skills.</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>Luxon was stunned when he noticed that his attacks were starting to miss.</p>, <p>'How is this...?'</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Even as he slashed again, he was stunned to see that his attack graced the air.</p>, <p>Planting his foot forward, Luxon went for an upward diagonal slash. He was mid-way through his motion when he suddenly felt a small resistance coming from the bottom part of his sword.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>Exerting more force, he managed to push through the resistance, but the few seconds lost due to the resistance were enough for Julien's foot to land on his stomach.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>The blow hurt, but it wasn't anything that he couldn't handle as he took several steps back. As Luxon was about to reposition himself, the resistance returned.</p>, <p>This time, it was latched onto his foot.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>Yet again, his movements had been impeded.</p>, <p>Another foot came at him. It wasn't very fast, and Luxon was able to dodge it. Dodging wasn't the problem. He could dodge all the attacks. They weren't anything that put him in a difficult spot.</p>, <p>The problem was the fact that he couldn't gather any 'rhythm'.</p>, <p>Before he could initiate any of his rehearsed sequences, they were consistently disrupted, throwing him off balance and severely impeding his ability to launch an effective counterattack.</p>, <p>Swoosh!</p>, <p>It was an annoying situation since it put him in a passive spot.</p>, <p>\"Kh, damn it!\"</p>, <p>Gritting his teeth, he slashed again.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Wow~ Luxon seems to be having a hard time.\"</p>, <p>By the side, Josephine observed everything with open eyes. Blinking her eyes rapidly, she looked at Kiera.</p>, <p>\"I'm not seeing things, right? Julien is actually holding his own...\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Kiera didn't answer.</p>, <p>Her eyes were currently fixed on Julien's form. At first, his movements were sloppy. At a glance, she could tell its faults and break them down.</p>, <p>Had she been in Luxon's position, she would've probably been able to deal with him in less than five bouts.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Things started to change gradually.</p>, <p>The madness that lingered within his eyes started to intensify, and his movements were beginning to become more refined.</p>, <p>Not only that but upon closer inspection, she noticed a familiar set of threads moving around and shattering Luxon's rhythm, preventing him from fully tapping into his skill.</p>, <p>But it wasn't that which sent chills down Kiera's spine.</p>, <p>No, it was the fact that the more the fight progressed, the fainter Julien's image became in her mind. It was as if he was transforming into an entirely different person.</p>, <p>From his movements to his expressions, Kiera was starting to see a different person...</p>, <p>'What the fuck.'</p>, <p>It was a strange thought.</p>, <p>One that she had a hard time coming to terms with.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>\"Haaa-!\"</p>, <p>Seeing Julien's lips tremble as his attack finally shattered Luxon's attack, Kiera noticed that the madness within his gaze further intensified.</p>, <p>The emotions he was feeling - Ecstasy, joy, excitement, she could see them in his expression as a genuine smile spread across his lips.</p>, <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>, <p>He started a frenzy of attacks. Controlling the thin threads, he continued to shatter Luxon's movements.</p>, <p>With no other choice but to stay passive, Luxon could only cover his body with his arms.</p>, <p>Bang...! Bang!</p>, <p>The more Julien attacked, the more Kiera saw his emotions run rampant.</p>, <p>At this very moment...</p>, <p>\"More.\"</p>, <p>He wasn't Julien. That person seemed to have been replaced by another entity, taking over his body as he attacked the flustered Luxon who despite not losing, was slowly and steadily getting pushed back.</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>As another one of Julien's fists landed on Luxon's guard, Kiera stood up and appeared beside the two.</p>, <p>\"Stop.\"</p>, <p>Kiera clasped Julien's fist.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>For a brief moment, Kiera thought he'd attack her as silence ensued between the two, but gradually, his eyes started to return to normal.</p>, <p>Eventually, he calmed down and lowered his hand.</p>, <p>Turning around, he picked up his blazer and unrolled his sleeves. With his back turned, he asked,</p>, <p>\"I take it that the result is clear, no?\"</p>, <p>Kiera looked at Luxon who despite being unhurt was panting heavily. Turning to look towards the others, she closed her eyes before nodding.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\".....Good.\"</p>, <p>With a small nod, he left the premises.</p>, <p>Staring at his back, Kiera's expression turned complex.</p>, <p>'What in the world... was that?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Shaa—</p>, <p>Feeling the cold water trickling down my face, I took a deep breath. Looking up, I stared at my reflection. A familiar visage met my gaze, but as I looked closer at my expression, I noticed the slight curl at the end of my lips.</p>, <p>Though I smiled, I wasn't actually smiling.</p>, <p>.....My body was smiling in my stead. No, rather, Alexander was smiling for me.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I let out a long breath and turned off the tap. Massaging my face, my smile gradually faded.</p>, <p>The same was true for the monotonous world around me as color started to return, and I felt my emotions become more pronounced.</p>, <p>The world...</p>, <p>It didn't feel as boring anymore.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Staring at the all-too-familiar expression, I finally relaxed.</p>, <p>'....It's a dangerous ability.'</p>, <p>I could still feel the lingering traces of Alexander lingering within the depths of my mind.</p>, <p>If I wasn't careful enough, then there was a chance that the Alexander in my memories would take over.</p>, <p>\"I can't allow that.\"</p>, <p>There was a goal that I needed to accomplish.</p>, <p>I couldn't lose sight of who I was before I even achieved my goal.</p>, <p>Even so...</p>, <p>\"It worked.\"</p>, <p>For just a few minutes, I was able to become 'Alexander'. It was sloppy, and I needed to put more work into it, but during the fight, I had become him.</p>, <p>It was for that reason that Luxon was thrown off during the fight.</p>, <p>While I still wasn't stronger than him, in this state, I could hold my own against him. Even hold him in a passive state.</p>, <p>The more I thought about this new ability, the more my heart thumped.</p>, <p>\".....So many possibilities.\"</p>, <p>What if I were to memorize and mimic more than one style? Not just Alexander. What if I tried to assimilate myself with more personalities...?</p>, <p>What would happen then? Would I be able to call forth different types of combat styles?</p>, <p>Though my physical limitations constrained how much I could imitate, if I could switch between personalities, it would certainly throw off a lot of my opponents.</p>, <p>If at one moment I was 'Alexander' and the next switched to another personality, then it would make it impossible for my opponent to predict how I fought.</p>, <p>\"It's an interesting idea.\"</p>, <p>One that I sort of wanted to put to the test but had to stop myself from doing so.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>My neck was starting to feel itchy, and my hand twitched at the sensation. I almost started to scratch my neck to get rid of the itch.</p>, <p>Leaning forward, I grasped the sides of the sink.</p>, <p>\"It's troublesome.\"</p>, <p>The new 'technique' sounded strong, but there were severe limitations to it.</p>, <p> It involved letting myself be immersed in the emotions and memories of another person. In the process, I needed to make sure to not lose sight of myself.</p>, <p>The more I immersed myself in them, the more I could copy and replicate their abilities, but at the same time, it also took a massive toll on me mentally.</p>, <p>I couldn't guarantee that I wouldn't lose sight of myself within those memories and emotions.</p>, <p>For that reason, I needed to be careful.</p>, <p>My neck felt itchy all of a sudden.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stared at my reflection and clenched my fist tightly.</p>, <p>\"Fuck off...\"</p>, <p>Alexander was starting to take over my mind once again. It was an exhausting situation. However, I resisted.</p>, <p>I didn't let 'Alexander' take over who I was.</p>, <p>Grasping tightly the corners of the sink, I brushed my wet hair to the side.</p>, <p>\"I'll control you.\"</p>, <p>Not just him, but whoever else I planned on assimilating in my mind.</p>, <p>I wasn't going to let them take over my mind.</p>, <p>That much, I was sure of.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The days passed and the day of the Midterms neared.</p>, <p>With the midterms being one of the main attractions of the Festival, it naturally attracted a lot of attention from the general public and big Guilds. But it wasn't without reason.</p>, <p>An announcement had been released by [Haven] a few days before the long-awaited midterms.</p>, <p>- [Announcement] -</p>, <p>In light of the delay with the midterms, the Haven facility has agreed with the other Academies within the Empire to open the midterms for all other Academies. This will now be a joint examination from students from all over.</p>, <p>- [Announcement] -</p>, <p>The news took over the Empire by storm as excitement boiled over the news.</p>, <p>Within a few days of the announcement, the Academy campuses became packed with people. From large sponsors to members of the fifteen Guilds. The Academy was filled with important figures.</p>, <p>Of course, there were plenty of reporters.</p>, <p>Cason Wallance, a rather renowned reporter walked around the Academy campus to interview the Haven cadets.</p>, <p>With their reputation, a lot of his audience was interested in listening to what they had to say.</p>, <p>Currently, he was interviewing a young cadet who appeared to be in his first year.</p>, <p>—How do you feel about the upcoming midterms?</p>, <p>—Oh, I feel great. I think my team will perform well.</p>, <p>—You're that confident?</p>, <p>—Well, I wouldn't say confident, but I trust in all the work I put in with them.</p>, <p>—That sounds amazing!</p>, <p>The interview flowed smoothly.</p>, <p>Whenever he asked a question, the cadet would respond with picture-perfect answers.</p>, <p>—You're aware that the other Academies will be coming for the upcoming midterms. Do you fear them a little?</p>, <p>—Oh, yeah. Even though we at Haven are hailed as the strongest, the other Academies are not to be looked down upon. They are extremely powerful in their own right. We can't let ourselves drown in our own arrogance.</p>, <p>It was a picture-perfect interview.</p>, <p>Humble, and confident. The interviewer nodded along as he interviewed the cadet.</p>, <p>—Thank you very much for the interview! I hope you and your team manage to achieve some success in the midterms.</p>, <p>—Haha, thank you very much.</p>, <p>Wrapping up the interview, the cadet left and Cason looked at the recording in satisfaction. After a little editing, he could send the video directly to be broadcast around the Empire.</p>, <p>Turning his head, Cason noticed his producer's expression looked troubled.</p>, <p>\"Is something wrong?\"</p>, <p>\"Hmm, well...\"</p>, <p>\"What is it? Spit it out? Did I make a mistake in the interview?\"</p>, <p>\"No, it's not that.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...?\"</p>, <p>\"It's monotonous. Bland. The people at Haven all seem to reply in the same manner. It's rather boring, don't you think?\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>When he put it like that...</p>, <p>Cason frowned.</p>, <p>\"What can I do? It's all live, and it's not like I can tell the cadets to start behaving irrationally.\"</p>, <p>\"No, I get that.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...?\"</p>, <p>\"It's whatever. Just keep doing your job. I'll think of something.\"</p>, <p>With these words, the producer left. Staring at his departing back, Cason scratched the side of his face.</p>, <p>\".....Bland.\"</p>, <p>Staring at the recording device, he sighed.</p>, <p>\"It looks like I'll have to do more interviews.\"</p>, <p>In a sense, he agreed with the producer. The interviews were indeed a little bland when taking into account that all of them were real.</p>, <p>There was no 'spice'.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, Cason's eyes widened as he caught sight of a group in the distance. As if they were magnets, they attracted the attention of all the people around them. Wherever they walked, heads would turn.</p>, <p>Walking at the front, was a familiar-looking cadet.</p>, <p>One that just recently had started to make waves. With an appearance that was hard to forget, Cason was sure it was him. Alongside him were four other cadets. Amongst them, one girl in particular stood out.</p>, <p>With platinum long hair and red hair, her appearance didn't lose out to Julien.</p>, <p>Without even thinking, he appeared before them.</p>, <p>\"Hello, cadets. If you don't mind, can I do a quick interview?\"</p>, <p>\"An interview?\"</p>, <p>A head popped up. With widened eyes, she looked at him with excitement.</p>, <p>\"Of course! Of course!\"</p>, <p>Cason sighed in relief. He didn't want to admit it, but he felt rather intimidated by Julien's gaze. That was despite him not doing anything that would warrant such intimidation.</p>, <p>\"Keum.\"</p>, <p>Clearing his throat, he turned on the recording device and started to interview. This time, unlike the previous attempts, he decided to hold the interview live.</p>, <p>—Hello, it's nice to meet you. Please introduce yourselves. Are you a group?</p>, <p>—Oh, yes! We are. I'm Josephine.</p>, <p>Stepping forward, Josephine introduced herself before pointing towards the others.</p>, <p>—He's Julien, our team leader. He's Anders, and he's Luxon.</p>, <p>—Oh, I see. And...</p>, <p>Cason pointed the recording device in the direction of the platinum-haired girl.</p>, <p>—I think you skipped her.</p>, <p>—No, I didn't.</p>, <p>—Uh?</p>, <p>—You can call her 'it'.</p>, <p>Finally speaking, Kiera looked at her with a scowl.</p>, <p>—Do you want to get hit?</p>, <p>—Maybe, the violent gorilla? No differenc-hiek!</p>, <p>Cason blinked as Kiera slapped Josephine's head.</p>, <p>'This is live...'</p>, <p>With a forced smile, he tried to calm the girls down and focused his attention on Kiera.</p>, <p>—....Hehe, friendly banter. Seems like the team chemistry is high.</p>, <p>—The fuck you on about?</p>, <p>Kiera looked at him with an expression that seemed to say, 'Is this guy an idiot? Chemistry? What the hell is that...?'</p>, <p>—....</p>, <p>Cason felt his face stiffen. Suddenly, he started to regret a lot of things.</p>, <p>—Ah, well...</p>, <p>And he quickly asked a question.</p>, <p>—How do you feel about the current format? A lot of Academies from the outside will be coming soon. Do you have any opinion on that?</p>, <p>—What do I care? It's a pain in the ass. If anything, they're just going to be a bother. It's not like they are any good to-hmmm!</p>, <p>Kiera was stopped mid-way as Josephin appeared from behind as she went on to cover her mouth.</p>, <p>—What are you doing?! This is getting recorded! Everyone will see you say this stuff!</p>, <p>—Hmm!</p>, <p>—Ak! You're licking me!</p>, <p>—The fuck are you putting your hand over my mouth for?</p>, <p>—Crap! You...!</p>, <p>Quickly wiping her hand over her shirt, Josephine's expression twisted as Kiera laughed at her from the side. Staring at the scene, Cason felt his face twitch.</p>, <p>'This isn't good.'</p>, <p>This team...</p>, <p>What the hell was this team?</p>, <p>Feeling that the interview was going in the wrong direction, Cason looked around and finally settled his gaze on Julien.</p>, <p>'Ah, right... There's him.'</p>, <p>Despite how intimidating he looked, he appeared to be the most reasonable of the group. Cason decided to interview him.</p>, <p>—What about you cadet Julien? What do you think about the recent news?</p>, <p>—.....?</p>, <p>As if not expecting to be interviewed, Julien looked down and tilted his head.</p>, <p>—About?</p>, <p>Cason cleared his throat and repeated.</p>, <p>—About the Academy's decision to open up to the other Academies for the upcoming examinations. Do you feel anything about that? There are quite a lot of powerful cadets in the other Academies. I'm sure you must've already heard of a few.</p>, <p>Cason went on to list a few names</p>, <p>—Johnathan Monroe. Karl Redhouse. Amelia Clementine... They're all high-level prospects just like you. Do you feel anything competing with such cadets?</p>, <p>—.....</p>, <p>Julien's expression didn't change much despite the question.</p>, <p>Initially, Cason thought he was mulling deeply over their names. Especially since he noticed his deep frown.</p>, <p>'Ah, judging from his expression, he seems to take them extremely seriously.'</p>, <p>As expected. Even the Black Star of Haven has heard of their names...</p>, <p>Julien's mouth soon parted open and Cason moved the recording device closer to his face. There was nothing more exciting than high-caliber prospects talking about each other.</p>, <p>This was sure to get the audience to pay attention and let them forget about the previous encounter.</p>, <p>Such were his thoughts until he heard Julien's words.</p>, <p>—.....Who?</p>, <p>At that moment, Cason froze.</p>, <p>He recalled his producer's words, and his mouth twitched.</p>, <p>Because...</p>, <p>He knew a storm had just started to brew.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>With the incoming midterms, cadets were allowed to rent training grounds for a few hours each day.

You're licking me!]</p>, <p>[The fuck are you putting your hand over my mouth for?]</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Aoife's mouth opened in an 'o' shape as she watched the screen.</p>, <p>But if that wasn't enough...</p>, <p>[Johnathan Monroe. Karl Redhouse. Amelia Clementine... They're all high-level prospects just like you. Do you feel anything competing with such cadets?]</p>, <p>[....Who?]</p>, <p>Right then and there, Aoife almost smacked her forehead.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She wasn't the only one who felt that way.</p>, <p>Raising his head, Leon looked around. His gaze met with Aoife's and Evelyn's. The two of them looked at him with the same expression and sighed almost simultaneously.</p>, <p>\"He's done it...\"</p>, <p>\"We're fucked.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Indeed, they were spot on. The moment the clip was streamed, it immediately made waves and started to be shared everywhere. Knowing how the media worked, it took no time for titles to appear.</p>, <p>[Who? A bold statement! Confidence or arrogance?]</p>, <p>[The Black Star announces his utter disregard for the incoming Academies.]</p>, <p>Shortly after, a Q and A was released.</p>, <p>It was from one of the cadets whom Julien had disregarded.</p>, <p> Johnathan Monroe of Montel Institute.</p>, <p>It went on as follows;</p>, <p>Q : What do you think about Haven's Black Star statement?</p>, <p>A : Quite frankly, nothing. I've also never heard of him. My only target is Aoife, whom I believe is the true Black Star.</p>, <p>Q : Are you saying that you don't take him seriously?</p>, <p>A : Who?</p>, <p>Q : I see what you did there.</p>, <p>The release of the Q and A sparked a new wave of conflict. To add fuel to the fire, the other two members joined in to release their own statements.</p>, <p>A : There's a rumor that he's the weakest Black Star in Haven's history. The standards seem to have fallen rather low.</p>, <p>- Karl Redhouse of Rodnea Academy.</p>, <p>A : Not interested. I have another target in mind.</p>, <p>- Amelia Clementine of the Silver Wing Institute.</p>, <p>Before the midterms could even start, sparks had already started to fly. Things were so heated that the topic became one of the most talked about throughout the Empire.</p>, <p>Just when everyone thought things couldn't get any more heated, a new interview was released.</p>, <p>This time, it was with none other than Haven's Black Star.</p>, <p>Q : There's a lot of buzz regarding what you said. Do you have anything to say to that?</p>, <p>A : No.</p>, <p>Q : Eh... Then, what do you have to say about what your competitors have said?</p>, <p>A : Haven't seen.</p>, <p>Q : You haven't?</p>, <p>A : No.</p>, <p>Q : Then... Do you have anything to say to the other Academies?</p>, <p>A : No.</p>, <p>Q : Should I repeat what they said...?</p>, <p>A : Annoying.</p>, <p>The interview ended there, but the buzz it created was even fiercer than before.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, Julien had become one of the central figures of the midterms.</p>, <p>With all attention focused on him, his performance in the midterms would be heavily scrutinized.</p>, <p>Unconcerned with all of this, Julien practiced with his team.</p>, <p>He was just about to spar with Anders when Kiera approached him.</p>, <p>\"Hey, do you seriously not care?\"</p>, <p>Stopping, Julien frowned.</p>, <p>\"About what?\"</p>, <p>\"The interview thing, you know?\"</p>, <p>\".....no.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Kiera scratched the side of her face. It seemed like she wanted to ask something but was unsure of how to ask.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"So, like...\"</p>, <p>\"Do whatever you want.\"</p>, <p>\"Really?!\"</p>, <p>Kiera's eyes lit up.</p>, <p>Looking at her briefly, Julien turned his attention away from her. He wasn't too bothered to figure out what she wanted. He just let her be. Wasn't as though she wasn't going to do it if he didn't give her permission.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>A new interview was released shortly after that.</p>, <p>Q : With a lot of the fire on your team captain, your team is currently under a lot of pressure. Do you have anything to say to that?</p>, <p>A : Yes.</p>, <p>Q : What is it?</p>, <p>A : Suck my ba-</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>There were only three days left until the midterms.</p>, <p>Classes had already stopped a week before the midterms. With cadets from the other Academies coming into the Academy, the air was rather tense.</p>, <p>All teams were getting ready for the upcoming evaluation. The same was true for my team as we all woke up early in the morning to train.</p>, <p>3 am.</p>, <p>\"Fuck, kill me... Why are we doing this so early in the morning?\"</p>, <p>We would start the day with physical training. Running for ten kilometers for the first ten minutes, and then going to the weight rooms to train our bodies.</p>, <p>Such was the plan.</p>, <p>5 am.</p>, <p>Clank--!</p>, <p>\"Come here! I'll fuck you up!!\"</p>, <p>We would then move to the dummy area where we spent the next few hours sparring against them. Kiera appeared rather aggressive today.</p>, <p>I didn't pay much attention to her and just focused on the dummy in front of me.</p>, <p>Time passed on like that.</p>, <p>It was now 8 am.</p>, <p>The team was now sitting at a large table where we all had our breakfast. Everyone seemed to be somewhat nervous about the coming examinations. Especially when considering the scale of the entire event.</p>, <p>\"Are you not nervous?\"</p>, <p>Overhearing Josephine's question, I turned to face her.</p>, <p>\".....Nervous?\"</p>, <p>Was I nervous?</p>, <p>I was extremely nervous. If I were to fail the examination then I would be in a lot of trouble. It wasn't something that I could fail.</p>, <p>It was for that reason that I pushed even more than before.</p>, <p>Still, I couldn't show that I was nervous. It wasn't because I didn't want to show weakness or something meaningless like that.</p>, <p>It more had to do with the fact that as the leader, I couldn't show them that I was nervous. A nervous leader wasn't a good leader.</p>, <p>So for that reason, I shook my head and replied.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Wow~ Here I am, shivering every day.\"</p>, <p>\"You and your nonsense again...\"</p>, <p>Kiera grumbled by the side, scooping some of the cereal in her mouth.</p>, <p>\"All ywo fwuking do... much... iws twalk a lot of nwonsense... munch.\"</p>, <p>\"Ugh, speak after you swallow your food.\"</p>, <p>Gulp.</p>, <p>\"I do whatever the fuck I want.\"</p>, <p>\"Yah, yah. I saw.\"</p>, <p>\"Kaka. What did you think of the interview? Did you see their reactions?\"</p>, <p>\"It's disgusting.\"</p>, <p>\"You say that, but the same applies to you.\"</p>, <p>\"That's disgusting.\"</p>, <p>\"Enough you two. Stop trying to start a fight. After you're done, let's go to the training grounds. They're going to announce the name of the event soon.\"</p>, <p>In response to Luxon's words, Kiera and Josephine quieted down and hurried to eat their breakfast. Unlike the two, I kept at my pace.</p>, <p>While it was indeed true that the 'team event' would be announced today, that would be in two hours.</p>, <p>There was no need to rush.</p>, <p>\"Eat slowly. We'll train more.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah? We're training more...? What sort of...\"</p>, <p>I felt all eyes pause on me. I didn't pay attention to the looks they were giving me. Cleaning my mouth, I stood up.</p>, <p>\"Team sparring. Let's go.\"</p>, <p>\"....No way, we just came back from training.\"</p>, <p>\"What sort of...!\"</p>, <p>Ignoring their words, I headed out of the canteen and proceeded to head back towards the training grounds.</p>, <p>There was no time to spare.</p>, <p>Along the way, I sighed.</p>, <p>\"Come on, make it quick....\"</p>, <p>By now, I was just waiting for the quest window to pop up. Every day, I would wake up to check if I received a new notification.</p>, <p>With how things usually flowed, it was bound to happen.</p>, <p>I just hoped it'd show up early so that I could better prepare for it, but...</p>, <p>\"It's not coming.\"</p>, <p>Regardless of how much I waited, the notification never came. There were only three days left now, and the more things were delayed, the more disadvantageous things would be for me.</p>, <p>I was just waiting at this point.</p>, <p>'Either nothing happens and the entire event is a good one, or something will happen and the quest window is going to appear soon.'</p>, <p>To be honest, I was leaning more towards the latter.</p>, <p>After getting a better idea of the sheer size and power of the organization, all hopes of the Academy thwarting whatever schemes they had disappeared.</p>, <p>While it was true that Delilah was present, thinking about the faceless man, I quite frankly didn't think she was as strong as him.</p>, <p>Rather, I thought she was inferior to him.</p>, <p>And not by a small margin.</p>, <p>\"Crazy.\"</p>, <p>It was a crazy thought.</p>, <p>For someone to be stronger than Delilah...</p>, <p>Just what was stopping him from conquering the entire world?</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>The more I thought about the faceless man, the more nervous I became. But even so, I had no choice but to look ahead.</p>, <p>I still had time...</p>, <p>Not much, but I had time.</p>, <p>\"—!\" Just as I took another step forward, the world around me froze and I lost control of my body.</p>, <p>'Ah, there it is...'</p>, <p>A vision.</p>, <p>'As expected, some bullshit is about to happen.'</p>, <p>The world around me started to shift and turn. Blinking twice, I found myself inside a small restaurant.</p>, <p>Two unfamiliar people stood on the opposite end of the table. Their figures appeared to be quite hazy, making it hard for me to decipher their appearance.</p>, <p>No, in fact, the entire vision appeared rather blurry.</p>, <p>'What's going on?'</p>, <p>It was the first time that I had experienced a vision like this. It was odd.</p>, <p>\"What do you think?\"</p>, <p>Even so, I had no choice but to pay close attention to the conversation. All information was vital.</p>, <p>\"....Well, I don't know. The situation is messed up. There's a lot of attention currently focused on Haven and the Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>A lot of attention focused on Haven and the Chancellor?</p>, <p>I perked up my ears to listen carefully.</p>, <p>\"It can't be helped. After the incident during the midterms, there's been a lot of complaints. The Royal family is using the situation to take her down a notch.\"</p>, <p>\"Ugh, how annoying. It wasn't even her fault.\"</p>, <p>\"Not her fault? She's the one overseeing Haven. It's her responsibility to look after these things.\"</p>, <p>\"Please. You know damn well it's not her fault. She may be strong, but she isn't omnipotent. If there's anyone to blame, then blame the inspectors. This is all their fault, to begin with. Had they not been so lazy...!\"</p>, <p>\"Stop, you don't know that.\"</p>, <p>\"But...!\"</p>, <p>The conversation started to get heated from that point. Straining my ears, I tried to pick up for any more words.</p>, <p>\".....Oy.\"</p>, <p>But before I knew it, I was back in the training grounds.</p>, <p>Before me, Kiera stood.</p>, <p>Sporting a frown, she looked at me.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing?\"</p>, <p>\"...Nothing.\"</p>, <p>I brushed her words away. However, from the corner of my eyes, I glanced at the notification that popped up.</p>, <p>My heart dropped.</p>, <p>[ ◆ Main Quest Activated : Midterms.]</p>, <p>: Character Progression + 207%</p>, <p>: Game Progression + 11%</p>, <p>Failure</p>, <p>: Calamity 1 + 15%</p>, <p>: Calamity 2 + 15%</p>, <p>: Calamity 3 + 15%</p>, <p>'....So the main storyline is starting.'</p>, <p>The stakes suddenly increased dramatically, and so did the rewards. Silently clenching my teeth, I brushed the notification to the side and stared at my group.</p>, <p>With heavy expressions, they all appeared to be stretching.</p>, <p>I pursed my lips.</p>, <p>\"....About training.\"</p>, <p>Everyone raised their heads to look at me. Even though I hadn't said anything, Kiera's expression suddenly changed.</p>, <p>So did Josephine's.</p>, <p>\"You wouldn't dare...!\"</p>, <p>\"No!\"</p>, <p>I didn't care for their screams and curses.</p>, <p>Stretching my arm, I muttered,</p>, <p>\"We're doubling it.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"Everything is ready. There shouldn't be a problem.\"</p>, <p>Atlas Megrail casually sat on his chair while looking at the scenery outside. A small orb rested on the wooden table beside him.</p>, <p>\"If everything goes well, then we can push the narrative forward. Add a little bit more oil to the fire, and we'll be able to get her out of the Academy.\"</p>, <p>—That's good.</p>, <p>A soft voice replied from the orb.</p>, <p>It was unknown to anyone but Atlas who the voice belonged to.</p>, <p>—What about the kid? Did you let him in on the plan?</p>, <p>\"Kid? Hm, you mean Phecda?\"</p>, <p>—He's quite a promising prospect. His talent evaluation has him as a potential 'Fiend Rank Prospect.'</p>, <p>\"Fiend, you say?\"</p>, <p>Leaning on his chair, Atlas thought back to Phecda.</p>, <p>Within the organization there were ranks. They went as follows; Discardable, Crazed, Fallen, Fiend, Low-seat, High-seat.</p>, <p>The highest rank within the organization was the High-Seat, something of which he was a member of. It was the highest rank within the organization, with only the leader ranking higher.</p>, <p>Below them were Low-seats, those that had the potential to become High-seats but weren't quite there yet.</p>, <p>Fiends came after.</p>, <p>Strong members with a lot of potential, but easily controlled.</p>, <p>Thinking about the conversation he had with Phecda not so long ago, Atlas suddenly smiled.</p>, <p>\".....I wonder about that.\"</p>, <p>—You wonder? Is there something wrong with Phecda?</p>, <p>\"No, nothing.\"</p>, <p>Atlas shook his head. He had only had a brief conversation with him. He wasn't quite sure of whether he had a potential higher than his current 'fiend' ranked potential.</p>, <p>From what he saw, he had the makings of someone who could become a seat.</p>, <p>'Well, who knows...'</p>, <p>The future was hard to predict. He needed to observe more before coming to a proper conclusion.</p>, <p>In any case, he remembered what the question was about, and answered.</p>, <p>\"I didn't let him in on the plan, but I'll probably tell him that something is going to happen.\"</p>, <p>—Oh?</p>, <p>There were no hints of surprise in the voice. It was as if they could tell exactly what Atlas was thinking.</p>, <p>—Let me guess. You want to see if he's capable of stopping what we've done.</p>, <p>\"You know me well.\"</p>, <p>Atlas laughed as his finger drummed lightly against the wooden table beside him.</p>, <p>\"If we let him in on the plan, and he tries to stop it to buy 'her' trust, then it might look too unnatural. It might even make things look suspicious.\"</p>, <p>—You're right.</p>, <p>\"If he can stop it, then there's a chance he might earn her trust. If he fails, then our plan succeeds and we can push her out of the Academy. Both are tempting options.\"</p>, <p>—....It looks like you've thought about all possible scenarios.</p>, <p> \"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Leaning his head back, Atlas's gaze drifted into a haze, his eyes losing their focus. It was as if he had been transported to another realm, detached from the present moment.</p>, <p>Gradually, his eyes closed.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>He let out a long breath.</p>, <p>\"All scenarios... I wonder about that.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>9:58 a.m.</p>, <p>A few minutes before the announcement.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa... That's it....! Haa... The announcement is... Haa... about to come. I can't take it anymore.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes... Haa...\"</p>, <p>\"No... More...\"</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I wiped the sweat from my body. My entire body was screaming with pain, and looking at the others who appeared to be utterly exhausted, I wiped my forehead.</p>, <p>\"I guess we can take a break.\"</p>, <p>Thump. Thump...!</p>, <p>Kiera and Josephine dropped to the ground at the same time.</p>, <p>\"Haa... I'm dying.\"</p>, <p>\"W-water.\"</p>, <p>Perhaps because I had been training with incredible intensity ever since I had entered the Academy, I was used to the high-intensity training unlike everyone else who was showing signs of exhaustion. In particular, Kiera and Josephine were breathing hard as they lay flat on the ground.</p>, <p>The other two didn't seem to be as tired.</p>, <p>But I could tell from just a glance that they shared the same sentiments as the girls.</p>, <p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>, <p>'.....They're supposed to be the elites of this world. This shouldn't be too much for them.'</p>, <p>I was still weaker than them. That much was clear to me. However, the gap which seemed insurmountable at the start was starting to shrink.</p>, <p>It became clear to me why. Compared to them, I was putting an extra 3 to 5 hours into training. The extra hours were allowing me to close the gap between us.</p>, <p>\"Oh, the announcement is here!\"</p>, <p>Suddenly sitting up straight, Kiera took out a small orb.</p>, <p>There, she started to read.</p>, <p>[Midterm Announcement :</p>, <p>—Labyrinth.</p>, <p>Explore the artificial labyrinth with team members. Points will be awarded for each monster that is killed.</p>, <p>At the end of the labyrinth, there will be a boss monster.</p>, <p>Combat with other teams is allowed. The team with the most points will win.</p>, <p>Announcement End]</p>, <p>The awaited announcement regarding the midterms arrived just as anticipated.</p>, <p>\"A labyrinth...?\"</p>, <p>Everyone was staring at the orb in Kiera's hand as it displayed a message above, almost like a hologram.</p>, <p>'What happens if I pass my hand through...?'</p>, <p>Would it pass through the projection?</p>, <p>\"This is interesting.\"</p>, <p>Kiera was the first one to voice out her thoughts.</p>, <p>\"So not only do we get to fight monsters, but we also get to fight other cadets?\"</p>, <p>\"It seems like it.\"</p>, <p>Luxon replied from the side.</p>, <p>\"If we defeat the other teams, all their points will be transferred to us.\"</p>, <p>\"Hehehe.\"</p>, <p>Covering her mouth, Kiera started to laugh to herself while quietly mumbling things like, 'fucking bastards, I'll show you that I wasn't lying in the interview...'</p>, <p>Josephine's face scrunched up on the side.</p>, <p>\"It can't be that...\"</p>, <p>\"Kakaka.\"</p>, <p>Briefly staring at them and then the announcement, I took my attention away from them and thought back to the vision. It had been nagging at the back of my mind for the past several hours.</p>, <p>'...As usual, there's not much I can work with.'</p>, <p>The only thing that I was able to pick up was that the backlash from the entire situation was going to affect Delilah.</p>, <p>Perhaps, this was in fact the goal of the organization.</p>, <p>It wouldn't come as a surprise to me if that were to be the case. I wasn't exactly sure what their goal was, but given that I was here, there was something that the organization wanted from the Academy.</p>, <p>If that was the case, then Delilah was most likely their biggest obstacle.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>But what exactly were they planning?</p>, <p>'Should I just go ahead and ask?'</p>, <p>This option wasn't exactly out of the table. I didn't want to, but it would clear up a lot of my troubles.</p>, <p>'Then again, if they wanted my assistance, I'm sure they would've told me something was up by now...'</p>, <p>Still, it wasn't as though I was without any clues.</p>, <p>There was in fact one clue that I had managed to pick up from the conversation.</p>, <p>'If there's anyone to blame, then blame the inspectors.'</p>, <p>It wasn't hard to piece out all the pieces from there. So long as I figured out who the inspectors were, and what their job was, then I figured that I would be able to figure everything out.</p>, <p>\"Hoo.\"</p>, <p>Letting out a long breath, I stretched my arms a little.</p>, <p>'I guess I'll start there.'</p>, <p>But first...</p>, <p>\"Are you guys ready?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Frowning, I stood up.</p>, <p>\"We've had enough rest. Let's start again.\"</p>, <p>But just as I stood up, I stopped and noticed that something was wrong with the others.</p>, <p>Their expressions...</p>, <p>\"Why are you looking at me like that?\"</p>, <p>They looked like they were constipated.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Haven Education Department.</p>, <p>There was a conference held by the high-ranking members of Haven and the other Academies.</p>, <p>There were ten people in total, consisting of Haven Chancellor Delilah Rosemberg, Chancellor Joffrey Stein, Chancellor Merylin Parlias, and a few other notable figures belonging to the other renowned Academies within the Empire.</p>, <p>In order to ensure that everything flowed smoothly, a meeting was taking place.</p>, <p>With that being said, the current focus was on the expected viewership of the event.</p>, <p>\"The last time we held a similar event, we reached a viewership count of about 20 million active watchers. The annual draft receives about 100 million, so realistically speaking, we should be aiming for 20 million plus.\"</p>, <p>The viewership was important. The midterms weren't only about testing the cadets so that the Guilds had more information about them, but it was also a source of income for the Academies.</p>, <p>With people subscribing to the event, the Academies would receive a percentage of the profit coming from the viewership.</p>, <p>It costs a lot of money to run an Academy.</p>, <p>For that reason, events such as these were regarded with high importance.</p>, <p>\"We've already marketed our sides quite well. Johnathan has a lot of pull in our region.\"</p>, <p>\"The same goes for our Karl. We've run a few promotional campaigns.\"</p>, <p>\"We say that our goal is 20 million, but I think we can aim higher. This year prospects are very promising.\"</p>, <p>\"Say, 30 million?\"</p>, <p>All in all, it was a fairly normal conversation.</p>, <p>Sitting by the side, Delilah watched all of this with an indifferent expression. The reality was that she felt sleepy.</p>, <p>Hearing the other Academies brag about their cadets was something she wasn't particularly interested in.</p>, <p>That was until Joffrey Stein, Chancellor of Montel Institute spoke up.</p>, <p>\"There's something that I'd like to address.\"</p>, <p>The atmosphere turned quiet as his deep voice echoed out. With everyone's attention focused on him, he tapped on his mana pad and displayed a certain interview.</p>, <p>It was an interview that everyone was all too familiar with.</p>, <p>—With a lot of the fire on your team captain, your team is currently under a lot of pressure. Do you have anything to say to that?</p>, <p>—Yes.</p>, <p>—What is it?</p>, <p>—Suck my ba-</p>, <p>His gaze turned towards Delilah.</p>, <p>\"Haven needs to think of properly punishing their cadets. This type of conduct is embarrassing.\"</p>, <p>Following his words, Delilah frowned. Before she could say anything else, as if in agreement, several other members present spoke up.</p>, <p>\"Her behavior is indeed inappropriate.\"</p>, <p>\"....I agree. She must be punished.\"</p>, <p>\"We can't encourage such behavior. It might impact the viewership rating of the event. We must do something about it before the citizens think that the cadets are some crude kids that can't control their mouths.\"</p>, <p>Words of criticism continued for a long time. Very obviously, the members of the other Academies weren't pleased with the way a few of Haven's cadets behaved during the interview.</p>, <p>After quietly accepting all the condemnations, Delilah looked around the room.</p>, <p>\"....Is that what everybody thinks?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes, we must punish her and release a statement condemning her actions. There's a high chance we might lose viewership because of the interview. It's best if we do something about it quickly.\"</p>, <p>\"I agree.\"</p>, <p>\"Same.\"</p>, <p>It was the inevitable outcome. Kiera had indeed gone a little overboard with the interview.</p>, <p>The public backlash was quite severe with several hate comments directed towards her and her team.</p>, <p>Had it been any other occasion, Delilah would've agreed with their requests.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Delilah shook her head.</p>, <p>\".....There's no need to punish her. In fact, we should all be praising her.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>\"What sort of...\"</p>, <p>\"We were at 15 million before the interview.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Sliding a paper across the table, her eyes traced the very top of it where it read;Current subscription count: 83 million.</p>, <p>\"We're now at 83 million.\"</p>, <p>The event.</p>, <p>It had blown up.</p>, <p>All of it thanks to one simple interview.</p>]\n",

Kiera would've been perfect for such occasions.</p>, <p>With how she usually acted, she would've probably beaten them all on the spot.</p>, <p>Currently, all team leaders for the upcoming event were called up to collect the rule book, and 'bracelets' which were supposed to be handed to all team members.</p>, <p>It was a low-ranked relic. A one-time use. In case a dangerous situation occurred, the bracelet would shatter and the spell [Barrier] would evoke, protecting the cadet from suffering any meaningful injuries.</p>, <p>Besides that, it also relayed the teams the overall scores of their team and the other teams.</p>, <p>It was a must-have item.</p>, <p>That said...</p>, <p>\"Is it possible for me to come back in ten minutes?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>\"I wasn't told that I needed to come up with a team name. Can I talk it over with my team?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, no. Unfortunately, not. We need the documents signed quickly, and an announcement was made. I'm not sure how you weren't aware of it.\"</p>, <p>\".....Right.\"</p>, <p>So they made an announcement...</p>, <p>It was bullshit, but what could I do? Staring at the paper in front of me, I sighed before jotting down a team name.</p>, <p>\"He...\"</p>, <p>I decided to go with the most random name I could think of.</p>, <p>It wasn't going to matter anyway.</p>, <p>\"Here you go.\"</p>, <p>Once I was done filling out the paper, I handed it to one of the assistants on-site who handed me five bracelets. They were rather heavy to the touch and were also rather thick.</p>, <p>Just as I was about to put on my bracelet, one of the assistants stopped me and warned me.</p>, <p>\"The moment you put on the bracelet, you will feel a little bit of pain. Please don't worry. It's part of the procedure.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p> Pain?</p>, <p>Why would there be pain?</p>, <p>\"The bracelet does more than just protect you and display your team points. It also measures your heart rate and mana capacity. If something is wrong, we'll be quickly alerted. To do that, it'll insert small needles into your skin.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh...\"</p>, <p>That made sense, but needles...</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stared at the device before putting it on.</p>, <p>As expected, a pain did come, but it didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. Rather, it felt more like a pinch.</p>, <p>\"Wow, you're rather resilient. You're the first cadet who didn't as much as flinch. I'm impressed.\"</p>, <p>\"....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>I wasn't sure whether the compliment was real or not, but I still thanked him.</p>, <p>I was just about to leave when I heard a soft whisper reach my ear.</p>, <p>\"There's no problem with your bracelet.\"</p>, <p>My steps stopped and I flicked my head to look back. However, the assistant from before had long disappeared from my sight.</p>, <p>\"Where did...\"</p>, <p>But it didn't take long for me to understand what had happened.</p>, <p>'....It's them.'</p>, <p>The organization.</p>, <p>Lowering my head, I stared at the bracelet again. For them to contact me now of all times...</p>, <p>\"How annoying.\"</p>, <p>Especially since I already knew that there was something wrong with the bracelets. After a little investigation, the only possible inspectors that were mentioned in the visions were the ones who checked the bracelets before they were handed over to the cadets.</p>, <p>It was obvious to me that whatever was going to happen, had something to do with the bracelets.</p>, <p>They were the only things that the cadets were allowed to bring to the examination.</p>, <p>\"....What should I do?\"</p>, <p>It was a troublesome situation.</p>, <p>The only message that I received was a simple, 'There's no problem with your bracelet.' What did this even mean?</p>, <p>Don't interfere? Interfere? Do whatever you want...?</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I massaged my forehead.</p>, <p>\"Why wou-\"</p>, <p>Halting mid-sentence, I pursed my lips. I suddenly started to have an understanding of the situation.</p>, <p>\"So that's how it is.\"</p>, <p>I didn't know how to react. No, rather. I felt like utter shit.</p>, <p>'In the end, they're just treating me as a pawn.'</p>, <p>It didn't take much for me to piece the pieces together. By telling me this information, they were essentially giving me a chance to prevent whatever they were doing.</p>, <p>It was almost as if they were treating this entire situation as if it was a game.</p>, <p>Either way, they weren't going to lose out.</p>, <p>If I were to succeed, then Delilah would 'trust' me more. If I were to fail, then their plan was going to succeed.</p>, <p>Whatever I did, they would benefit.</p>, <p>That feeling...</p>, <p>'It's disgusting.'</p>, <p>The feeling of being treated as a mere pawn. I had a hard time trying to stomach it. However, despite my apprehensions about it, I didn't let my frustrations out.</p>, <p>There was no need for me to show my disgust towards the situation.</p>, <p>At the end of the day, I was also playing with both sides.</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>The irony of the situation made me laugh.</p>, <p>\"Right, right...\"</p>, <p>Fiddling with the bracelets, I took a second look behind me before leaving the premises.</p>, <p>\".....Guess I'll continue to play along.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Three days passed in a flash. It was now the day of the midterms.</p>, <p>[Is everyone ready...?]</p>, <p>The [Labyrinth Raid] was one of the most anticipated events in recent history within the Empire. The viewership, which had been expected to be within 20-30 million, surpassed that by a large margin, hitting numbers closely resembling that of the yearly draft.</p>, <p>The media was naturally very interested in the event with recording devices set up all over Haven's arena grounds.</p>, <p>Within the tunnels that led to the main stage, the loud voice of the announcer echoed through.</p>, <p>[....In a short moment, we will announce the participating teams' names. Please show your support once they come out. For now, let's welcome the members of Montel Institute!]</p>, <p>In the corner of the tunnel was a small display that flashed as Johnathan Monroe, the genius of Montel Institute proudly stood with his sword raised. Behind him were his other group members.</p>, <p>\"Wooo—!\"</p>, <p>The cheers of the crowd reached the tunnels.</p>, <p>\"Wow, holy shit.\"</p>, <p>Staring at the end of the tunnel where the crowd was, Kiera blinked her eyes rapidly. Feeling the thunderous atmosphere outside, she felt subtle goosebumps run down her body.</p>, <p>\".....I can feel the ground quaking by how loud they are.\"</p>, <p>Standing beside her, Josephine stood rigidly. Her face was entirely pale as she held onto the side of the wall to support herself.</p>, <p>\"R-r-re-all-y?\"</p>, <p>\"What's wrong with you?\"</p>, <p>\"N-n-not-h-in-g. I'm f-f-ine.\"</p>, <p>\"Pussy.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah....\"</p>, <p>\"Knock it off, Kiera. Can't you see she's nervous?\"</p>, <p>Unable to take it anymore, Luxon interfered. Instantly, Kiera's face scrunched up as she looked up at him.</p>, <p>\".....Then get her to calm down. In her current state, she'll probably get knocked out by the wind.\"</p>, <p>\"That's...\"</p>, <p>Luxon's lips twitched.</p>, <p>He couldn't argue with that...</p>, <p>\"But still. You're making the situation worse.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, please.\"</p>, <p>Kiera waved her hand dismissively before looking towards the end where a figure appeared. Leaning against the wall with his arms crossed, he appeared to be deep into his own thoughts.</p>, <p>Kiera called out for him.</p>, <p>\"Oy.\"</p>, <p>And he opened his eyes.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"What are you looking at me like that for?\"</p>, <p>She pointed towards Josephine who was now on her knees, blankly staring towards the ceiling while silently mumbling, 'I'm not nervous. You're nervous. No, you.'</p>, <p>Kiera's eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"Crap, she's fucking lost it.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Seeing that Julien was still silent, she frowned.</p>, <p>\"What? Say something.\"</p>, <p>\"Something.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>\"I said something.\"</p>, <p>\"The f-Haa, shit.\"</p>, <p>Covering her forehead, Kiera clicked her tongue. How useless could one get? She was just about to take matters into her own hands when she recalled something.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right. What's our group name?\"</p>, <p>At that question, all heads flicked in Julien's direction. Even Josephine's head turned as she finally seemed to have recovered a little bit.</p>, <p>The news about a sudden team name had left everyone stunned. Because that bast-guy, had forced them to train so hard for over the past week, they hadn't seen the announcement about the need to come up with a team name.</p>, <p>In the end, Julien was the one who had named their team. Three days had passed since then, and even now they still weren't aware of what their team name was.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Feeling everyone's gaze, Julien remained silent.</p>, <p>\"So...?\"</p>, <p>Only when Kiera urged him did he reply.</p>, <p>\"I didn't put much thought in the name.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay, and...?\"</p>, <p>\"That's it.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Kiera blinked. So did the others. Frowning, Luxon spoke in Kiera's stead.</p>, <p>\"We're about to get called up soon. Shouldn't you tell us what the name is so that we won't get confused later?\"</p>, <p>\"Confused?\"</p>, <p>Julien suddenly looked up. All of a sudden, the corner of his lips lifted and everyone's expressions froze.</p>, <p>They felt chills.</p>, <p>\"Did he just...\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>, <p>\"What is...? He can smile?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Unbothered by their comments, Julien moved away from the wall and stepped ahead, heading deeper into the tunnel.</p>, <p>Just in time, the light that signaled for them to enter flashed.</p>, <p>As everyone stared at him in confusion, his even voice quietly reached their ears.</p>, <p>\"There's no need to worry about getting confused.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>\"What does that even mean?\"</p>, <p>\"Hold up, wait!\"</p>, <p>Following him from behind, the five of them headed out of the tunnel. Along the way, Kiera would pester him for answers, but all she'd receive was the cold shoulder.</p>, <p>From the outside, the cameras picked up their appearance, and the stadium roared with cheers.</p>, <p>\"Uwaaaah! Hooooo—! Kiera!!\"</p>, <p>\"Ahhhh! They're here! Kill them!\"</p>, <p>\"Boooo!\"</p>, <p>It was a mix of cheers and jeers. Nonetheless, their appearance sparked something within the crowd as the entire stadium shook.</p>, <p>\"Wow, shit!\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...! I think I'm going to faint.\"</p>, <p>Kiera flinched and Josephine almost tripped over her own feet. Thankfully, Anders supported her in the nick of time.</p>, <p>\"Woooo—!\"</p>, <p>The crowd's reception was drastically different compared to the other teams that had already set foot into the stadium. It was a lot more heated.</p>, <p>If not for the fact that a protective shield separated the crowd from the cadets, things would've been thrown at them.</p>, <p>The recording devices picked all of this up as their faces appeared on the magical screens up above the arena grounds, and finally, the long-awaited announcement came.</p>, <p>[Let's welcome the newest team....]</p>, <p>With a short pause, the recording devices zoomed in to pick up the faces of the team.</p>, <p>Staring up ahead, they seemed to be eager to hear their names. They were indeed eager.</p>, <p>Just what was their team name going to be?</p>, <p>With bated breaths, they waited for the announcement which came shortly after.</p>, <p>[.....Julien and his sidekicks!]</p>, <p>At that moment...</p>, <p>Besides Julien, all the other members' expressions twisted as their heads flicked towards him.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Staring back for a brief moment, his head turned and he acted as if nothing had happened.</p>, <p>However, if one paid close attention, they'd notice a subtle tremble of his shoulders.</p>, <p>\"H-ho...\"</p>, <p>Noticing this, Kiera felt her chest tremble. Taking a step forward, she brought her hands forward.</p>, <p>His neck. His thick and sturdy neck… In Kiera's eyes, it looked lonely.</p>, <p>The others quickly widened their eyes.</p>, <p>\"Wait! Kiera...!\"</p>, <p>\"No, stop!\"</p>, <p>\"Not here!\"</p>, <p>\"I'll kill you!\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"Uwaaa—!\"</p>, <p>The moment Julien and his team entered the stadium, all eyes fell on them as the audience thunderously cheered or booed them. Their reception was vastly different compared to the other teams who had already entered.</p>, <p>\"...He's the Black Star?\"</p>, <p>\"As expected, he's not that strong.\"</p>, <p>Karl Redhouse, a cadet with short red hair and eyes stood with his arms crossed. Standing on his spot, he casually observed the new entrants.</p>, <p>His innate skill was [Aura Detection]. So long as the gap wasn't that big, it granted him the ability to have a general idea of someone's strength.</p>, <p>Generally, in his field of view, he was able to see hues. The thicker, and larger the hue was, the stronger the individual was.</p>, <p>\"He's decent.\"</p>, <p>Such was his evaluation of Julien after using his skill on him.</p>, <p>A purple hue surrounded his body. It was neither thick nor thin. Just average.</p>, <p>\".....That chick with platinum hair is strong though.\"</p>, <p>In fact, upon closer look, within his group, he had the weakest aura. All his other teammates had thicker aura than him.</p>, <p>'That said, I heard he's an Emotive Mage.'</p>, <p>His Aura Detection wasn't able to assess Emotive Mages. But it wasn't as though he was worried about that.</p>, <p>To him, the one that stood out the most to him was the platinum-haired girl. She was certainly something...</p>, <p>\"What are they doing...?\"</p>, <p>A cold voice echoed from the side. Turning his head, Karl caught a glimpse of a young woman with short blue hair and subtly smirked.</p>, <p>Amelia Clementine of the Silver Wing Institute. As expected, her aura was just as large as the platinum-haired girl from Haven.</p>, <p>Staring into the distance, her brows knit.</p>, <p>\"Are they fighting?\"</p>, <p>\"They're a bunch of clowns.\"</p>, <p>Her voice was followed by an indifferent one from the side. Turning his head, Karl's eyes paused on the black-haired youth.</p>, <p>Johnathan Monroe.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Immediately, Karl's expression turned grim. It wasn't because he had bad blood with him, but his aura... It was shocking.</p>, <p>To the point where even Amelia's seemed to be overwhelmed.</p>, <p>'A monster.'</p>, <p>Such was Karl's evaluation of Johnathan. Still, swallowing his words, he remained calm and turned his attention back towards the group in question.</p>, <p>They were currently...</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Stunned, Karl blinked his eyes to make sure he wasn't seeing wrong. Blinking again, and seeing the platinum-haired girl being held back by her other team members as their team leader stood still expressionlessly, Karl didn't know how to react.</p>, <p>\"What the hell...\"</p>, <p>\"I guess they weren't aware that their team was going to be named as such.\"</p>, <p>Overhearing Amelia's words, realization finally dawned on Karl and he laughed.</p>, <p>\"So that's how it is...\"</p>, <p> Julien and his sidekicks. Looking at how the team was, he shook his head.</p>, <p>\"It doesn't seem like we'll need to worry much about them, then.\"</p>, <p>Their overall strength was quite good, but compared to their teams, it was lagging by a little. With that being said, the main reason he didn't see them as a threat was that they didn't even seem to be able to work as a team.</p>, <p>\"They don't have any chemistry.\"</p>, <p>It was an observation that everyone agreed to. It was a little disappointing when he thought about it.</p>, <p>After all that talk...</p>, <p>[Next up, let's welcome the next team from Haven.]</p>, <p>Yet again, the announcer's voice echoed throughout the entire arena grounds.</p>, <p>All heads turned towards a certain tunnel.</p>, <p>'The next Haven team.'</p>, <p>To be honest, Karl had some expectations. The team leader for the next Haven team was supposed to be Aoife K. Megrail.</p>, <p>In everyone's eyes, she was the real Black Star. It was still a mystery to them how she had not become one.</p>, <p>'.....I wonder how strong her team is.'</p>, <p>In Karl's opinion, it was going to rival Johnathan's.</p>, <p>And then, their team name was called.</p>, <p>[.....Please welcome, Dream Catcher.]</p>, <p>Booom!</p>, <p>The surroundings shook as the audience roared with excitement.</p>, <p>\"Waaah—\"</p>, <p>Aoife, as a member of the royal family, was an idol to most citizens. Despite some of the tyrannical rules implemented by the Megrail family, they were still extremely respected.</p>, <p>Therefore, the moment she stepped out of the tunnels, to reveal her long flowing red hair, peerless beauty, and yellow pupils, the entire arena grounds quaked with excitement.</p>, <p>\"Aoife!!\"</p>, <p>\"Wooooo—!\"</p>, <p>\"Black Star!\"</p>, <p>There were even chants about the Black Star mixed within. The sight was one to behold, but...</p>, <p>\"W-what is this...? H-how?\"</p>, <p>Karl found himself shuddering at the sight before him.</p>, <p>Not one, not two, but three.</p>, <p>Overwhelming their surroundings, Karl stared at the three massive auras off in the distance.</p>, <p>In particular, he stared at the aura that came from a young man with black hair and gray eyes. He was handsome, almost as much as Haven's Black Star, but unlike him, his aura...</p>, <p>\"Ah, this...\"</p>, <p>It was overwhelming.</p>, <p>Almost to the point where it felt suffocating.</p>, <p>\"How is this possible?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The moment Aoife's team, which included Leon and Evelyn, entered the arena grounds, the entire surroundings shook with fervor. It was to the point where I had to cover my ears given how loud the noise was.</p>, <p>From above, I could see the recording devices centered towards them.</p>, <p>\"Ah, shit—!</p>, <p>With how loud it was, I could barely hear Kiera as she covered her ears with both hands.</p>, <p>Thankfully, this didn't last for very long. Once the cheers ended, the announcer shared the rules of the match. It was something that we as a team had already gone over beforehand so it wasn't anything new.</p>, <p>In the end, after a few minutes of talk, we were all led towards separate tunnels.</p>, <p>[Exams begin]</p>, <p>And with the announcer's words, the test began.</p>, <p>Immediately, all teams entered their respective tunnel. We did so as well. But unlike the other teams, we weren't in a rush.</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>The quiet sound of our footsteps echoed as we found ourselves in a large squared tunnel. Walking at the front, thin threads moved out from my hand.</p>, <p>They snaked forward, moving along the path.</p>, <p>As we moved, a small device hovered around us. It was most likely the monitoring device for the audience and staff.</p>, <p>Just as I took several steps forward, I heard Kiera's voice from behind.</p>, <p>\"Oh, shit.\"</p>, <p>Turning my head, I noticed that she was staring at her bracelet. Curious, I looked at mine too and understood why she was reacting like that.</p>, <p>— [Team Score] —</p>, <p>[Dream Catcher] - 110 Points</p>, <p>[Swords of Fiest] - 85 Points</p>, <p>[Crow's Dance] - 66 Points</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>[Julien and his sidekicks] - 0 Points</p>, <p>— [Team Score] —</p>, <p>\"Eh? How are they so fast...?</p>, <p>\"I mean, it's them, so...\"</p>, <p>Anders was the one who responded to Josephine's question.</p>, <p>\"Uh, yeah but still... This is crazy...\"</p>, <p>The monsters within the Labyrinth were the same as the ones from the Mirror Dimension. Because of the general strength of the cadets, the monsters included in the dungeon ranked from Infant to Junior rank.</p>, <p>An infant-ranked beast was equivalent to 5 points, while a Junior ranked was 100 points.</p>, <p>\"....Not even two minutes passed, and they've killed a Junior and two infants?\"</p>, <p>Josephine muttered with a baffled look.</p>, <p>Staring at her watch, her face paled.</p>, <p>\"At this rate, we might not even rank within the top.\"</p>, <p>\"Fuck!\"</p>, <p>Cursing, Kiera looked at me.</p>, <p>\"Oy, you. Let's pick up the pace.\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>\"We go at the same pace.\"</p>, <p>\"But—\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Kiera raised her hands again. It looked like she was eyeing my neck again. Without sparing her another glance, I elaborated.</p>, <p>\"We've already discussed this beforehand. There will be a boss at the center of the maze. It will count for 5000 points. I'd rather conserve my energy and face the boss monster than waste time fighting a bunch of weak monsters.\"</p>, <p>This was something that we had already decided beforehand.</p>, <p>They were probably taken aback by the strong start from the other teams. I couldn't blame them, but if we wanted to win, this was the best method.</p>, <p>Furthermore...</p>, <p>I glanced at my bracelet.</p>, <p>'I'm sure things will become annoying further down the line.'</p>, <p>It was for that reason that we couldn't afford to waste any energy.</p>, <p>At least, not yet.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>In another part of the maze.</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>Several figures flashed quickly. Their speed was extremely fast, and wherever they passed, corpses would appear.</p>, <p>Hieeek—!</p>, <p>A screech resounded upfront.</p>, <p>\"I've got it.\"</p>, <p>Aoife pushed her hand forward, and a large snake floated in the air. Waving her hand, the snake splattered against the wall of the maze.</p>, <p>A chime rang from the bracelet shortly after.</p>, <p>[+10 Points]</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>The group didn't stop.</p>, <p>Kracka! Kracka!</p>, <p>From lightning to sword flashes. Wherever they went, all that would be left was devastation.</p>, <p>[+10 Points] [+10 Points] [+10 Points]</p>, <p>Chimes continued to ring constantly.</p>, <p>They were simply unstoppable. Such seamless teamwork and coordination, left the spectators watching outside in a stupor.</p>, <p>The team carried on like this for the next few hours.</p>, <p>They didn't have a direction. However, they didn't need a direction.</p>, <p>\"Over here.\"</p>, <p>Leon had his instincts. Whenever they encountered a fork road, he'd follow his instincts. It was thanks to this that the team didn't encounter a single dead end.</p>, <p>\"....Let's stop here for now.\"</p>, <p>But even so, at some point, they did stop.</p>, <p>\"Hooo.\"</p>, <p>Aoife took a deep breath and wiped some of the sweat on her forehead. While she wasn't exactly tired, she was also not exactly energized.</p>, <p>Looking around, she leaned against one of the walls.</p>, <p>\"Are you guys good?\"</p>, <p>\"Haa... A little. Could be better.\"</p>, <p>As a mage, Evelyn's stamina was amongst the lowest within the group. For that reason, she had a harder time conserving her stamina.</p>, <p>The two other members, Ronald, and Ainsla were also somewhat tired.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa...\"</p>, <p>Catching up her breath, Evelyn turned her attention towards Leon who was staring at his bracelet with a frown.</p>, <p>\"What's wrong...?\"</p>, <p>Staring at her watch, and seeing that they were first at 751 points, with over 90 points ahead of the second team, she was confused by Leon's reaction.</p>, <p>\"What are you worried about?\"</p>, <p>\".....It's nothing big.\"</p>, <p>Though he said that, Evelyn could tell something was taking over his mind.</p>, <p>When she turned her head, she also noticed Aoife staring at the watch with a frown. What's up with these two?</p>, <p>\"Are you guys worried that Sword of Fiest will catch up with us?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>The two replied almost at the same time.</p>, <p>Stunned, Evelyn looked between the two of them. Leon looked away from his bracelet and replied.</p>, <p>\"I'm not worried about them.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...? Crow's dance?\"</p>, <p>They were the team headed by Karl Redhouse. He was a strong competitor, but Evelyn didn't think he was as strong as Johnathan from Swords of Fiest.</p>, <p>\"Not that too.\"</p>, <p>\"Not them too...? Ice twist?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"No?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn blinked and scrolled through the list. They were the top three teams and the ones closest to them. If it wasn't them, then...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn finally realized and her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"Them?\"</p>, <p>What sort of...? While she had to agree that Kiera and Luxon were strong, the others were not as strong. Julien was also somewhat strong, but not to the point where he'd worry someone like Leon and Aoife.</p>, <p>\"Julien and his sideki-\"</p>, <p>\"Kh.\"</p>, <p>A strange noise interrupted Evelyn.</p>, <p>Pausing, she looked up. Aoife and Leon were staring at her expressionlessly. They were looking at her with the same stoic look they usually wore. Hmm. Could she have heard wrong?</p>, <p>\"Julien and h-\"</p>, <p>\"Pft.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn blinked.</p>, <p>Staring at the two of them, her lips twitched. Especially when she noticed that their eyes were both bloodshot.</p>, <p>What in the world...</p>, <p>\".....Are you guys okay?\"</p>, <p>In response to her question, Leon took a deep breath and nodded.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Aoife did the same.</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn casually nodded. Then, just as the two seemed to have gathered their bearings, she quickly spat.</p>, <p>\"Julien and his sidekicks.\"</p>, <p>\"Pfttt—\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The raid was set to last for approximately ten hours. It wasn't a long time, but it also wasn't a short time for these types of events. There were some events that would even run for more than a few weeks.</p>, <p>This was a moderately small event.</p>, <p>Even so, it was one that was packed with non-stop action.</p>, <p>\"Whaaa--!\"</p>, <p>\"Go! Kill them!\"</p>, <p>\"Ahhh!!\"</p>, <p>The crowd maintained the same energy as at the start. In fact, the fervor only seemed to have increased as the rankings were displayed for all to see.</p>, <p>-- [Team Score] --</p>, <p>[Dream Catcher] - 915 Points</p>, <p>[Swords of Fiest] - 885 Points</p>, <p>[Crow's Dance] - 876 Points</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>-- [Team Score] --</p>, <p>Since the start, the rankings remained the same. However, slowly but surely, the other teams were slowly starting to catch up with [Dream Catcher] who took a brief pose to rest.</p>, <p>\"Go!!\"</p>, <p>\"Johnathan--! You're only a few points away! You can do it!\"</p>, <p>Needless to say, the atmosphere was heated.</p>, <p>Especially when they could see all the highlights displayed on the large projections up above. Because the broadcast wasn't solely focused on one team, the attention would shift from team to team on multiple occasions.</p>, <p>Thanks to this, all that the spectators saw was endless action.</p>, <p>\"Uwaaa!\"</p>, <p>In one of the VIP boxes, several important figures sat, staring at individual projections. Unlike the crowd, they could glance at the individual performances of the teams.</p>, <p>\"It seems like this is going to be a close race.\"</p>, <p>Chancellor Joffrey Stein said while massaging his thick beard. In front of him, the team [Sword of Fiest] was displayed.</p>, <p>In particular, a figure stood out as he cleared most of the monsters by himself. It was none other than Johnathan, the pride of the Montel Institute.</p>, <p>With a talent that Chancellor Joffrey Stein believed to surpass Aoife of Haven, he was confident in the chance of his Institute team reaching the first rank.</p>, <p>Especially since they followed a heliocentric system, a system solely centered towards one outstanding figure, which was devised to perfectly maximize Johnathen's qualities while covering for his inadequacies.</p>, <p>'...And people said Helio doesn't work.'</p>, <p>The Chancellor chuckled slightly.</p>, <p>The scene before him was the perfect proof that it worked.</p>, <p>\"Well, the race is indeed close, but at the end of the day, it'll all boil down to which team gets to the boss monster first and kills it.\"</p>, <p>Interrupting his thoughts was Chancellor Merylin Parlias of Rodnea Academy. Leaning back on his chair, and observing her own projection, she brushed one of her golden locks behind her ear.</p>, <p>\"Right now it's just a warm-up. What really matters at the end of the day is the boss monster. Whoever gets to it first will most likely win the competition.\"</p>, <p>\".....I'm not so sure about that.\"</p>, <p> Chancellor Joffrey shook his head in disagreement.</p>, <p>\"While it is true that the boss monster will provide the most points, you forgot something.\"</p>, <p>A smile spread across his lips.</p>, <p>It was a disgusting smile that made Merylin frown.</p>, <p>\".....Monsters aren't the only way one can get points.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Realization dawned on the Rodena Chancellor as her expression scrunched up.</p>, <p>Indeed, monsters weren't the only way to collect points. So long as a team defeated another, they'd be able to collect the other team's overall points. The final boss was indeed not the last hurdle.</p>, <p>Right after defeating the boss, the teams had to find an exit and escape the labyrinth before passing.</p>, <p>Before that, it was all fair and game.</p>, <p>\"The boss is nice, but just because you can defeat doesn't mean you'll end up becoming the victor.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>At that, Merylin leaned back without saying a single word. The same was true for the other Chancellors as they stared at the screens with somber expressions.</p>, <p>While everyone already knew this, to say it publically like this left a distaste in the mouths of many.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The only one who appeared unaffected by the entire conversation was Delilah who stared stared at her projection. In fact, she hadn't been listening at all.</p>, <p>Her current focus was on the groups displayed before her.</p>, <p>All of whom belonged to Haven.</p>, <p>So far, they were all performing excellently. However, if Delilah had to be honest, her attention was currently focused on two groups.</p>, <p>[Dream Catcher] and [Julien and his sidekicks]. For some reason, staring at the second group name, Delilah found herself raising her brow.</p>, <p>'....It rolls well on the tongue.'</p>, <p>Still, that wasn't the problem.</p>, <p>Staring at the ranking board, Delilah was unsure of what to make of things.</p>, <p>[Julien and his sidekicks] - 105 Points.</p>, <p>Lagging far behind the other Academies, they appeared to be on a leisurely stroll. At the corner of the projection, Delilah could see the viewer count.</p>, <p>At first, it had been at over 7 million viewers.</p>, <p>It was now at 800 thousand.</p>, <p>She could also see that the public sentiment was getting worse and worse as time went by. Not only the public but subtly glancing towards the other Chancellors, she could feel from their expressions that they also felt the same way as the public.</p>, <p>It was embarrassing.</p>, <p>However, Delilah didn't think the same. Staring at Julien from the screen, her gaze turned somewhat hazy.</p>, <p>'....Are they finally going to make a move?'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"A monster ahea--\"</p>, <p>\"Ahhh!\"</p>, <p>Booom--!</p>, <p>A fire bloomed in the distance as a powerful shockwave swept the surroundings. My clothes and hair fluttered as a result of the aftershock of the explosion.</p>, <p>\"Th--\"</p>, <p>Booom--! Booom--!</p>, <p>Before I could say anything else, I was interrupted by more explosions as Kiera threw one spell after another.</p>, <p>\"Fucking die! Die!\"</p>, <p>Pursing my lips, I looked to the side and saw Josephine standing still with her mouth agape.</p>, <p>\"Wow, she's totally lost it. Like, totally lost it.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Quietly, the others nodded alongside her comment.</p>, <p>Indeed, staring at Kiera, I could see that she had totally lost it. I couldn't blame her. While we weren't dead last, we weren't anywhere near the top.</p>, <p>For someone as competitive as her, this was torture.</p>, <p>\"....Calm down.\"</p>, <p>Moving next to her, I pressed my hand against her shoulder.</p>, <p>\"Wh-....!\"</p>, <p>Her expression immediately changed. Her face morphed from angry to sad to then angry again to then happy.</p>, <p>\"Fuck, shit!\"</p>, <p>A curse inevitably slipped out of her mouth as her face twisted to show all sorts of emotions.</p>, <p>There were perks to being an Emotive Mage. One such perk was that I could manipulate Kiera's emotions to the point where she became confused about what she was feeling.</p>, <p>At the same time, it raised a thought in my mind.</p>, <p>'I wonder... if I develop my ability more, will I be able to stop them from experiencing a certain emotion?'</p>, <p>It was an interesting thought.</p>, <p>Currently, the best that I could do was insert a new emotion into the one that they were already experiencing. In doing so, I put them in a state of confusion which in turn, makes them forget about whatever emotion they were experiencing.</p>, <p>In this case, I mixed sadness and joy within Kiera's emotions, eventually toning down whatever anger she had.</p>, <p>While useful, it did take a bit of mana, and it didn't completely clear away her anger.</p>, <p>What I wanted to know was whether I could directly remove an emotion from their mind for a brief moment of time.</p>, <p>Fear, anger, sadness... If I could stop someone from experiencing such emotion for a brief moment, during critical moments, then it would prove to be an extremely useful skill.</p>, <p>Even better, seal all my emotions for a brief moment of time.</p>, <p>\"Alright, stop. You can take your hand off of me.\"</p>, <p>Looking at Kiera, and seeing that she had calmed down, I removed my hand from her shoulder.</p>, <p>As I did, I noticed the others look at me with impressed looks.</p>, <p>Especially Josephine who raised her thumbs up.</p>, <p>\"As expected of our team leader. You are useful after all.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Pretending to not have heard her words, I shifted my attention back toward the tunnels.</p>, <p>Closing my eyes, I extended the threads forward. The mana inside of my body started to drain at a faster speed as they extended. However, I continued to do so.</p>, <p>I wasn't doing this without reason.</p>, <p>Along the way, I'd be able to sense the monsters that were ahead. With that, we could prepare for the incoming monsters which would put us at an advantage.</p>, <p>'There's a total of ten...'</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>I suddenly paused.</p>, <p>I sensed something else.</p>, <p>\"Cadets?\"</p>, <p>I blinked my eyes and turned my head. All of a sudden, everyone's eyes were fixed on me. Especially Kiera's. They seemed to be salivating.</p>, <p>.....If that was even possible.</p>, <p>\"A group?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"....Then?\"</p>, <p>\"They seem to be fighting monsters ahead. I'm not sure how many.\"</p>, <p>\"Ho.\"</p>, <p>Kiera's fingers twitched. Raising her head, she looked at me with an expression that seemed to say, 'We're killing them, right?'</p>, <p>Well, killing is a bit...</p>, <p>\"Are we?\"</p>, <p>\".....I guess so.\"</p>, <p>While we were indeed going at our own pace, we did need points.</p>, <p>I didn't see why not.</p>, <p>Thus.</p>, <p>\"They're up ahead.\"</p>, <p>\"Good, let's go.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, Kiera didn't rush by herself and waited for us to come. Retrieving the thread, I led them toward where I had last sensed the group.</p>, <p>Tracing my memories, I hurried my footsteps while the others followed behind me. I wasn't worried about any of us losing sight of each other as I had one of my threads circle everyone's ankles.</p>, <p>Of course, it was with their permission.</p>, <p>As tiny as the threads were, they weren't hard to detect if they were near.</p>, <p>I hadn't yet reached a level where I could do that.</p>, <p>\"....It's near here.\"</p>, <p>Coming to a stop, I brought my finger over my mouth. We were just by the corner, and with a turn, we'd be able to see the other cadets.</p>, <p>'If my estimates are correct, they should be fighting monsters.'</p>, <p>And as expected...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>In the distance, we could hear the loud sound of metal clashing. Kiera's expression lit up at the sound.</p>, <p>Turning to look at me, I nodded my head and she immediately rushed forward.</p>, <p>A magic circle had already formed in her hand as her feet slid across the ground and she brought her hand forward.</p>, <p>\"Die you fu-uh?\"</p>, <p>The moment she turned the corner, her expression faltered and her circle shattered.</p>, <p>Noticing her expression, I instantly had a bad feeling and rushed to turn the tunnel.</p>, <p>\"Oh, god.\"</p>, <p>\"What...?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah!\"</p>, <p>The expression of everyone present changed drastically. Perhaps because I somewhat expected for this to happen, my expression didn't change.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Standing over the corpses of several cadets was a single hooded figure. In his grasp was a cadet who flung his arms widely.</p>, <p>In his last moments, our gazes met.</p>, <p>His expression seemed to say, 'Help', but...</p>, <p>Crack—</p>, <p>His neck snapped before we could do anything.</p>, <p>Tik.</p>, <p>At the same time, the small recording device floating next to us fell on the floor, and the figure turned its head, its hollow gaze focusing on us.</p>, <p>My body tensed under its gaze.</p>, <p>The same was true for the others as they got into combat positions.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>In the tense silence that suddenly overtook our surroundings, his gaze remained firmly locked on me.</p>, <p>I didn't flinch and stared back.</p>, <p>At that moment, I realized something.</p>, <p>'He knows me.'</p>, <p>No, Julien.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A strange silence suddenly took over the surroundings. Standing face to face with the hooded figure, neither side moved.</p>, <p>....Or more like, the hooded figure was too concentrated on me to make any moves.</p>, <p>'He knows me.'</p>, <p>The more time passed, the more I was sure about it.</p>, <p>Whoever was beneath the hood, knew the previous Julien. My fingers twitched at the thought.</p>, <p>For some reason, I felt a different emotion rather than being scared. I wasn't sure what that emotion was, but if there was something that I was clear of, it was the fact that I...</p>, <p>I wanted to see his memories.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>The silence was shattered by the low 'thud' of the now-deceased cadet's body hitting the ground. From the side, Josephine flinched involuntarily at the sound.</p>, <p>On the other hand, Kiera frowned.</p>, <p>I couldn't tell what she was thinking. With her gaze fixed on him, it seemed like she realized something.</p>, <p>\".....Oy.\"</p>, <p>And with such thought, she was the first one to speak.</p>, <p>Her voice attracted the hooded figure's attention as their head turned to face her. Lowering her head slightly, Kiera looked up.</p>, <p>\"Who are you?\"</p>, <p>It was an unexpected question. No, rather, it was a logical question, but from what her expression previously read, she seemed to be aware of something else.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Her question was met with silence.</p>, <p>A magic circle flickered in her hand. It was directed towards the hooded figure.</p>, <p>However, before she could even fully form her magic circle, he disappeared. Time seemed to slow down at that moment.</p>, <p>Before the others could react, the figure reappeared before me.</p>, <p>I didn't react at all.</p>, <p>But even so, as their hand grasped my shoulder, I felt my body lift up slightly. In the last few seconds, I watched as the others looked at me with widened eyes.</p>, <p>'Ah.'</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>The surroundings changed.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It all happened so fast that Kiera hardly had any time to react.</p>, <p>Her mind had been so preoccupied with thoughts of the hooded figure being connected with her aunt that she couldn't react at all when the hooded figure disappeared before her very eyes.</p>, <p>Shortly after, he reappeared right before Julien.</p>, <p>\"Wa-\"</p>, <p>In those last moments, her eyes met with Julien's.</p>, <p>They...</p>, <p>Felt oddly calm. Almost as if he had been expecting such a situation. However, Kiera wasn't sure if what she had seen was true or not as he disappeared alongside the hooded figure shortly after.</p>, <p> By the time she had moved, they were already gone.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>In the silence that suddenly gripped the surroundings, Kiera's mouth opened and closed repeatedly.</p>, <p>She was unsure of what to say at the moment.</p>, <p>\"Ha, this...\"</p>, <p>Breaking her out of her thoughts was Josephine who was looking at her bracelet with a pale face.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"T-that...\"</p>, <p>Frowning, Kiera was about to smack her in the head when Anders spoke for her.</p>, <p>\"The bracelet. It doesn't work.\"</p>, <p>\"Mine too.\"</p>, <p>Upon hearing Luxon's confirmation, Kiera looked down at her bracelet and tried to activate it. However, besides the ranking, the emergency function wasn't working.</p>, <p>\"Fuck.\"</p>, <p>A curse slipped out of her mouth then.</p>, <p>\"W-what do we do?\"</p>, <p>Hearing Josephine's panicked voice, Kiera didn't answer immediately. For some reason, she recalled a conversation they had a few days ago.</p>, <p>'If anything happens to me, you take the lead.'</p>, <p>Kiera didn't think much of it back then. She thought that in the case he got injured, or the other teams got him, she'd be the next one to take the lead.</p>, <p>It made sense since she was the strongest in the team.</p>, <p>However, thinking back to the calm expression on his face during those last moments, Kiera had another thought.</p>, <p>'What if... What if he expected something like this to happen?'</p>, <p>It was a ridiculous thought. One that made absolutely no sense.</p>, <p>So... why?</p>, <p>Why did such thoughts keep flashing in her mind?</p>, <p>\"Ugh.\"</p>, <p>Groaning, Kiera ruffled her hair. Fuck, now's not the time to think about such things...! Looking around, Kiera's eyes suddenly paused.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>They were fixed on her ankle. There, she could still feel Julien's thread. Her eyes widened all of a sudden, and she turned in the direction of where the thread was.</p>, <p>Gritting her teeth, she shouted.</p>, <p>\"Fuck! Follow me...!\"</p>, <p>This guy...</p>, <p>There was no way he didn't know about this!</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A few moments before the attack.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Delilah was quietly staring at all the projections of the cadets before her. There were plenty of projections, but with her mind, she could focus on all of them at the same time.</p>, <p>It was of no burden to her.</p>, <p>For now, everything was proceeding smoothly.</p>, <p>All the cadets were advancing at their own pace. Some faster than others.</p>, <p>Even so, Delilah didn't particularly care about the speed. At the end of the day, what mattered was the final score, not the speed.</p>, <p>The leading cadets were running through the maze fast because they wanted to get to the boss monster faster, but even that wasn't a viable solution since it expanded a lot of energy. Only the elites of elites could follow such a reckless strategy.</p>, <p>It was for that reason that Julien's team took her interest the most.</p>, <p>For them to go at such a pace... Surely, they had a plan.</p>, <p>\"What the hell?!\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>It was at that moment that Delilah noticed the first irregularity.</p>, <p>Lifting her head, she noticed one of the Chancellor's frowning. Setting her sights on him, Delilah recognized him immediately. He was the Chancellor of a medium-sized Academy.</p>, <p>The Astell Institute.</p>, <p>It was a respectable Academy.</p>, <p>However, for some reason, he was currently making a small fuss.</p>, <p>\"What's going on here? Why is this not working?\"</p>, <p>When she took a better look, Delilah did indeed notice a peculiarity with his projection. It was all black.</p>, <p>Immediately, her brows trembled slightly.</p>, <p>'....It can't be.'</p>, <p>Closing her eyes, she spread her mana outwardly. Within a few short moments, they covered the entire stadium and seeped into the tunnels.</p>, <p>However, she felt something block her attempt just as she did so.</p>, <p>Immediately, her eyes opened up.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>There was no trace of panic in her expression. Looking around, she slowly stood up from her seat and excused herself. Her actions attracted the attention of a few Chancellors, but that was about it.</p>, <p>They were all too focused on their own cadets.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Moments after coming out of the room, her figure blurred and she arrived at the emergency entrance of the Labyrinth.</p>, <p>Located outside of the arena, and in a more secluded area of the Academy, where only a couple of small storage buildings stood, it was established so that the participants could be evacuated in case of emergencies.</p>, <p>The reason why she came here by herself was because she didn't want to let the news out that something had happened.</p>, <p>If the news were to spread, the audience would without a doubt start to panic which would cause quite a little bit of trouble. Concerning the other Chancellors, she couldn't trust any of them.</p>, <p>Delilah preferred to act before anybody noticed anything.</p>, <p>It was for that reason that she decided to operate by herself.Especially since she also had an idea as to who the ones involved were.</p>, <p>'It should be this one.'</p>, <p>Stepping over a certain area, Delilah waved her hand.</p>, <p>Immediately, the ground fluctuated, revealing what appeared to be a large metallic trap door. Glowing in a multitude of colors were a set of runes.</p>, <p>Delilah was just about to enter when she heard a voice coming from behind.</p>, <p>\".....I wouldn't do that if I were you.\"</p>, <p>Without saying a word, Delilah turned her head.</p>, <p>An unexpected figure appeared.</p>, <p>\"Aziel Kleber.\"</p>, <p>One that Delilah was somewhat familiar with. He was a known criminal within the Empire. Someone whom the royal family put a heavy bounty on.</p>, <p>'So he's also a part of them...'</p>, <p>It wasn't as though she didn't expect it.</p>, <p>With a wave of her hand, the space around them fluctuated, and a dome covered their surroundings.</p>, <p>'Space separation'</p>, <p>It was one of her spells—a creation that enabled her to fashion a separate dimension, isolating individuals within it.</p>, <p>With this technique, she didn't need to worry about anything getting destroyed or anyone finding out about their current exchange. To the outside world, it looked like nothing was happening.</p>, <p>\"Wow, you're taking things rather seriously.\"</p>, <p>Standing taller than her, and leaning against one of the walls, Aziel's hazel eyes glowed mysteriously as he looked around.</p>, <p>A thin smile spread across his lips.</p>, <p>\"Even so, I'm happy that the one closest to the Zenith recognizes me.\"</p>, <p>\"....How did you get here?\"</p>, <p>Delilah wasn't one to brag, but she was powerful. Her perception covered the entire Academy 24/7. Not only that, but the Academy also had several other powerful individuals whose perception was just as great as hers.</p>, <p>Added to the many devices installed around the Academy, Delilah found herself frowning.</p>, <p>'Something is not adding up.'</p>, <p>There had been too many problems as of late.</p>, <p>Clearly, something wasn't working within the Academy. A traitor, perhaps?...And for them to be able to do something like this, they were without a doubt high up within the Academy.</p>, <p>The thought made Delilah's frown deepen.</p>, <p>'Who?'</p>, <p>In any case, Delilah couldn't dwell too deeply on the matter. She had a job to do at the moment, and sparing Aziel a single glance, she raised her hand.</p>, <p>Kraka—!</p>, <p>The space around him folded, then compressed, squeezing him into a pulp.</p>, <p>It had all happened so fast that he hadn't had any time to react.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Silence once again returned to the surroundings.</p>, <p>Just as Delilah was about to turn her attention back towards the entrance, a figure hovered in the air above her.</p>, <p>Wearing a smile, he looked at her.</p>, <p>\"....You don't seriously think I'd let myself be that close to you, do you? I'm not suicidal.\"</p>, <p>Rubbing his neck, he chuckled before reappearing a few meters away from her.</p>, <p>He looked to be in a good mood, nonchalantly walking around as if he was enjoying the moment.</p>, <p>\"Besides a few, I don't think there's anyone in this world that can truly fight on equal terms with you. Sadly, I'm not one such individual either. However, my job is to stall for time, so-Uh?\"</p>, <p>His words stopped mid-way. All of a sudden, Delilah's eyes changed.</p>, <p>As if ink had been injected into her eyes, they turned inky black as the darkness spread to envelop the entire eye.</p>, <p>A change began to sweep through the surroundings.</p>, <p>Suddenly, the background began to fade away.</p>, <p>The sun transformed into a stark white orb, casting a hollow light over the landscape. The surroundings shifted to shades of gray, and the ground began to sink beneath Aziel's feet.</p>, <p>From the depths, black hands emerged, reaching out for him as he surveyed the grim scene with a solemn expression.</p>, <p>No longer did her appear as nonchalant and happy as he did before.</p>, <p>In fact, that expression was long gone. What replaced it was one of fear and apprehension as he went on to hoarsely say,</p>, <p>\"Domain...\"</p>]\n",

This went on for several minutes until we eventually came to a stop.</p>, <p>\"Huff.\"</p>, <p>I stumbled forward slightly.</p>, <p>When all was said and done and I managed to recover my bearings, I looked up to see the hooded figure staring at me without saying a single word.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>However, there was something about that gaze that felt familiar.</p>, <p>'....What do I do now?'</p>, <p>I was in a bit of a slump at the moment.

That was indeed my name.</p>, <p>Staring at his complexion and seeing that he was doing well, I nodded slightly.</p>, <p>\"You're looking a lot better since the prison. I take it you've been doing well since I last saw you.\"</p>, <p>\"Haha, well. It's a nice place.\"</p>, <p>\"It is.\"</p>, <p>I looked around and leaned my back against one of the walls.</p>, <p>'....So the one who he was familiar with was me, but not the previous Julien?'</p>, <p>How odd. For a moment, I was convinced that the reason he looked at me like that was because he knew the previous Julien. Instead, it was me.</p>, <p>It took me aback.</p>, <p>Amid my thoughts, the Professor looked down at my ankles.</p>, <p>\"That?\"</p>, <p>\"It's nothing.\"</p>, <p>I raised my arm to display the threads.</p>, <p> \".....My teammates will come here soon. I did it so that I don't lose sight of them.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>The professor nodded his head.</p>, <p>Then, as if recalling something, he handed me a small map alongside a device.</p>, <p>\"This is?\"</p>, <p>\"It's a map of the dungeon.

It was there that I came to know of his identity.</p>, <p>It was also that understanding that truly made me aware of how powerful the organization was.</p>, <p>For them to have a potential contender for the crown and a high-ranking member of the Academy...</p>, <p>'It's no wonder shit keeps happening.'</p>, <p>To make matters worse, they not only operated within one empire but all four major ones. Their strength wasn't something a simple Academy could contend with.</p>, <p>The thought made me shudder.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Still, I took the map and device without hesitation.</p>, <p>The device was rather small. It was about the size of a stopwatch, and in it, I could see red dots.</p>, <p>'It's like a radar...'</p>, <p>No, it was practically a radar.</p>, <p>On the display, there were two red dots. It was probably us.</p>, <p>'This will be useful.'</p>, <p>Then, I turned my attention towards the map. Staring at it for a good moment, I found myself frowning after a bit.</p>, <p>'This is more complicated than I expected.'</p>, <p>While I had indeed thought that the Labyrinth was big, the map gave me a true view of just how big the Labyrinth was. It was massive.</p>, <p>In fact, judging from where we were, I felt my lips twitch.</p>, <p>'We're barely still at the entrance.'</p>, <p>We were nowhere near close to the center of the Labyrinth.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>Taking another quick skim of the map, I folded it and placed it in my pocket. I then turned to look at the Professor.</p>, <p>\"I've been wondering for a bit now. But how did you manage to get yourself involved in this mission?\"</p>, <p>Professor Bucklam was a rather controversial figure within Haven. His appearance here wasn't something I expected from him.</p>, <p>Then again, if it was because he wanted to meet me again, it made sense.</p>, <p>\"....It wasn't exactly hard. The mission was posted on the 'Mission Board' and I just took it. Since I met the criteria, it all went smoothly from there.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>I nodded, pretending to have understood what his words meant. For now, I kept the words 'Mission Board' in mind. It was a new piece of information.</p>, <p>In any case, there was something that I was curious about.</p>, <p>\"If you don't mind me asking, what's the mission about?\"</p>, <p>\"Oh, that.\"</p>, <p>Pondering, the Professor began to explain.</p>, <p>\"We have several units moving around taking care of the lower-rank cadets. The boss monster is also affected. We've drugged it with some Orphion. It was originally, a medium-ranking Junior rank monster. With the drug, it should be just beneath the threshold of Terror rank. Not quite there yet.\"</p>, <p>\".....Oh.\"</p>, <p>I was only able to understand a small part of his comment.</p>, <p>However, I could more or less understand what he was trying to imply.</p>, <p>'The lower-ranked cadets don't gather much interest from the crowd. My best guess is that they want the higher-rank cadets to move toward the boss where they will all suffer critical injuries due to how powerful it is. At the same time, since most of the attention is on the higher-rank cadets, their suffering will be witnessed by the entire Empire which in turn can be used as a weapon to push Delilah out.'</p>, <p>It was a somewhat simple plan. One that I could follow.</p>, <p>But there were a few things that weren't clear to me.</p>, <p>\"What about the Chancellors? How are you planning on dealing with them?\"</p>, <p>Last I recall, they were all incredibly powerful people. There was no way they'd notice that something was amiss.</p>, <p>Especially Delilah.</p>, <p>Who could even stop her...?</p>, <p>\"I'm not entirely sure.\"</p>, <p>The Professor replied with a helpless smile.</p>, <p>\"It's information that's beyond someone of my rank. Most likely, a few big shots have been sent to take care of them.\"</p>, <p>\".....I see.\"</p>, <p>That made sense.</p>, <p>\"Is that all?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>The Professor nodded.</p>, <p>\"I just came here to give you the files. Since we're working together and all.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, I see. Thank you very much.\"</p>, <p>What a sweet guy. It was a good idea to work with him.</p>, <p>\"For now, I'll complete the mission. What will you do Phecda?\"</p>, <p>I thought for a moment before answering.</p>, <p>\"...I'll probably interfere.\"</p>, <p>\"You will?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>I could just ignore the entire situation, but I didn't want to fail the quest. I was still unsure of what the failure would bring, but the boost in stats was quite appealing to me.</p>, <p>.....If I could do it, then why not?</p>, <p>\"Do you need me to do anything?\"</p>, <p>\"No, that's fine. It's not ideal for you to move. We proceed as you planned in the prison.\"</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>With a nod, the Professor was just about to put his hood back on when I stopped him.</p>, <p>I held up the thread and showed it to him.</p>, <p>\"If you don't mind, is it okay if I attach this to your ankle?\"</p>, <p>Before he could ask why, I explained.</p>, <p>\"The radar doesn't exactly tell me where you are. It only tells me the general location of every one. It would be better if I attach this to you.\"</p>, <p>\".....I see.\"</p>, <p>The Professor didn't seem to be quite on board with the idea, but eventually, he sighed and agreed.</p>, <p>\"Sure. I'll do it.\"</p>, <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>, <p>With a flick of my hand, the thread moved down and attached to his ankle.</p>, <p>Perhaps surprised by how quick the process was, he looked up.</p>, <p>\"That's it?\"</p>, <p>\"That's it.\"</p>, <p>What else was I supposed to do?</p>, <p>\"Alright, I'll be leaving now.\"</p>, <p>\"....Yes.\"</p>, <p>With a nod, Professor Bucklam donned his hood back on and turned to head in the opposite direction.</p>, <p>I stared at his back until it eventually disappeared from my sight.</p>, <p>It was nice to see his face again.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Within the quiet corridors of the Labyrinth, a hooded figure moved. It had been a few minutes since he had separated from Phecda, and after walking a few more steps, Giel stopped.</p>, <p>\".....It's sad I wasn't able to get more information.\"</p>, <p>Contrary to his previous voice, his voice changed, becoming more hoarse.</p>, <p>\"At least, he seems to be committed to his role.\"</p>, <p>Beneath the hood, the face wiggled, morphing from what had previously been the Professor's face to a new one.</p>, <p>With two glowing red eyes and a youthful face, the figure massaged its mouth.</p>, <p>\"Umm, haa... Huu... Hee...\"</p>, <p>Gradually, he started to get accustomed to his normal voice as he went on to mutter.</p>, <p>\"....It's always a pain to change my voice.\"</p>, <p>Indeed, [Mimic] was a unique innate skill of his. It enabled him to change his voice and face as he wished. So long as he had a sample of them, it was no problem for him.</p>, <p>In any case...</p>, <p>\"It was nice to see him again.\"</p>, <p>Phecda.</p>, <p>It was a familiar face.</p>, <p>They weren't close, but they knew each other.</p>, <p>\"He's different from the past.\"</p>, <p>He was a lot calmer than compared to his past self. In fact, it was odd to see him like that.</p>, <p>\"I better report this. It seems like Phecda is committed to following his role.\"</p>, <p>It was no coincidence that he had appeared before Phecda and his team. In fact, he had been waiting for them from the very start.</p>, <p>He had been assigned a goal beforehand.</p>, <p>One, to give Phecda the necessary tools to carry on the mission. Secondly, to gauge his intentions and gain some information from him.</p>, <p>Phecda's change in behavior was rather noticeable.</p>, <p>There were a few similarities to how he acted in the past, but he was also very different.</p>, <p>Giel was able to confirm this upon meeting him.</p>, <p>\"I might need to observe more, but he is certainly different.\"</p>, <p>The reason Giel had disguised himself as Professor Bucklam was because he had been helped by Phecda to escape the prison.</p>, <p>It was also to check if there was anything between the two.</p>, <p>There were a few things that didn't make sense in the prison escape. For one, Phecda shouldn't have been aware of what was going on.</p>, <p>Secondly, there were a few things that didn't match up between the Professor's statement, and the other escapee's statements.</p>, <p>There were a few discrepancies that he needed to check out.</p>, <p>That being said, there was something peculiar that caught his attention during the conversation.</p>, <p>\"Proceed as planned in the prison?\"</p>, <p>It was an interesting piece of information. So was there really something between the two?</p>, <p>\"I wonder, could it be that the t—Uh?\"</p>, <p>Halfway through his sentence, Giel suddenly felt a discomfort.</p>, <p>The world suddenly looked unbalanced. Almost as if it was tilting. What came after that was a sudden wave of weakness.</p>, <p>Thud!</p>, <p>One that suddenly turned extremely painful as he fell to his knees.</p>, <p>\"W-what...?\"</p>, <p>Stunned, he looked towards the ground.</p>, <p>There, his eyes widened as he noticed a large pool of blood coming from his ankles. No, rather...</p>, <p>\"M-my foot...!\"</p>, <p>It was gone.</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>Just then, the faint sound of a footstep echoed in the distance.</p>, <p>\"It's...\"</p>, <p>Giel's eyes widened as a dark figure approached from the distance.</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>With another step, his figure became clear.</p>, <p>\"....You.\"</p>, <p>Giel's expression changed at the sight of the person ahead. Before he could say anything else, a hand reached out for his face.</p>, <p>A cold voice followed after as Giel's world turned dark.</p>, <p>\"....Like I said, it was nice seeing his face.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath and stared at the figure beneath me. He was dead. I made sure he was.</p>, <p>Killing... It was starting to become easier for me. It was still hard on the mind, but the more I did it, the more I was getting accustomed to it.</p>, <p>I wasn't sure whether this was a good thing or not.</p>, <p>'I'm slowly starting to lose sight of my old self...'</p>, <p>Perhaps, I was. But it didn't matter. People evolved based on circumstances, and this was how the circumstances had made me.</p>, <p>....I didn't regret it.</p>, <p>At the end of the day, people always change.</p>, <p>There was nothing wrong with changing.</p>, <p>\"But who would've thought...?\"</p>, <p>I looked at the corpse beneath me. My chest itched a little and I ruffled my hair into a mess. The raw emotions that I felt were still lingering in my mind. It was hard to swallow, but I had already seen plenty before.</p>, <p>It took me a couple of seconds to fully recover.</p>, <p>Part of the speedy recovery was because another more important thought was plaguing my mind.</p>, <p>\"It seems like they're taking notice of my strange actions.\"</p>, <p>I thought that I had been able to clear most of the suspicion based on my talk with Atlas, but it didn't seem to be the case.</p>, <p>There were still lingering doubts...</p>, <p>'Good thing that I was paying attention.'</p>, <p>The real giveaway was the way that he called me.</p>, <p>Phecda.</p>, <p>It made no sense for the Professor to call me like that. But of course, it could also be because he came to learn of my identity. But even so... for him to call me such a name more than once?</p>, <p>Something didn't quite make sense.</p>, <p>Even so, I pushed my doubts down and carried on with the conversation.</p>, <p>My attention had been fixed on the map and the 'radar'. They were useful tools. Still, what was the most impressive about the entire situation was that he acted and sounded the same as the Professor Bucklam that I knew.</p>, <p>There was only one problem.</p>, <p>'We proceed as you planned in the prison'</p>, <p>He had never planned anything. The fact that he acknowledged such a 'plan' was the greatest giveaway to me.</p>, <p>With that, I was certain and proposed to attach the thread to his ankle.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I wasn't sure about his strength.</p>, <p>However, he was most likely stronger than me. In fact, there was also a high chance he was stronger than my entire group combined.</p>, <p>But even someone like him...</p>, <p>Still fell by my hands.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Silently clenching my hands, I took out the 'radar' and map.</p>, <p>\"So the red dots represent group members...\"</p>, <p> Just as I said those words, a red dot popped up on the radar. I stared at it for a good minute before setting it aside taking the cloak from Giel's body and donning it on.</p>, <p>Raising the hood, I took one last glance at the body before leaving.</p>, <p>\".....It's not your fault.\"</p>, <p>Such were the words I said before I took a step forward.</p>, <p>However, just as I did, I lowered my head to stare at the radar on me. More specifically, the red dot.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>A thought suddenly entered my mind and I turned back to look at the corpse behind me.</p>, <p>\"That might work.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>The Labyrinth was large. A lot larger than I previously thought. However, with the map, I was able to navigate it smoothly.</p>, <p>As I moved, I stared at the thread behind me.</p>, <p>'....Should I detach it?'</p>, <p>The thread's range wasn't infinite. Its length was equivalent to how much mana I had. Therefore, the greater the distance between me and the others, the more mana I expanded.</p>, <p>It was a bit of a problem considering that there were things that I needed to do.</p>, <p>\"Whatever.\"</p>, <p>In the end, I chose to keep it.</p>, <p>I was bound to reunite with them one way or another.</p>, <p>\"Huff.\"</p>, <p>My steps felt a little heavy, but I kept at it and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>\"Let's see.\"</p>, <p>Glancing at the 'radar' I came to a stop.</p>, <p>Thump.</p>, <p>Just ahead there was another red dot. Fiddling with it, I also saw that there was a small button at the side. While Giel hadn't fully explained to me how the 'radar' worked, I could tell this was some sort of signal that I could use to alert the nearby members.</p>, <p>Looking around, I took a deep breath and evened out my breath.</p>, <p>In the far distance, I was able to hear the loud 'clanking' sound of metal clashing.</p>, <p>'As expected, it's like he said. They're targeting all the low-ranking cadets.'</p>, <p>It was as Giel said to me.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking another deep breath to calm my nerves, I lowered my head to stare at my forearm.</p>, <p>Two leaves were glowing.</p>, <p>Unlike the first clover leaf, the cooldown for the second was much lower.</p>, <p>About one hour.</p>, <p>That was enough.</p>, <p>Clenching my hand, I pressed the button.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"H-help...!\"</p>, <p>The piercing scream of a cadet reverberated through the narrow corridor of the Labyrinth. Following closely were hurried footsteps as two cadets, under attack, attempted to escape the chaos.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, it was useless.</p>, <p>Spurt—!</p>, <p>\"Uaakh!\"</p>, <p>Blood gushed from the cadet's body as she collapsed limply to the floor, her eyes wide open in shock. Standing behind her, a hooded figure loomed ominously.</p>, <p>The figure stared at her with utter disregard as its heads turned to look behind where one last cadet remained.</p>, <p>\"A-ha... Pl-ease...!\"</p>, <p>As the cadet pleaded, he continued to press onto his bracelet. He was most likely trying to activate the emergency button.</p>, <p>But that was a futile effort.</p>, <p>The bracelet... It wasn't working.</p>, <p>As the hooded figure drew nearer, the expression of the cadet changed. In his last moments, he tried to launch an attack.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>But it was deftly blocked by the hooded figure who merely raised his hand to block it.</p>, <p>\"N-no...!\"</p>, <p>In the end, all that the cadet could do was scream in despair as a hand reached out for his neck, snapping it in one go.</p>, <p>Cra Crack—</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Silence once again returned to the surroundings.</p>, <p>Staring at the corpses around it, the hooded figure lowered down his hood to reveal a youthful figure. With short brown hair and hazel eyes, he looked no older than the cadets around him.</p>, <p>And he was indeed their age. Arian had been a member of the Inverted Sky since he was a child.</p>, <p>Dealing with cadets of this level was of no trouble for him.</p>, <p>....Looking around, his expression was wholly indifferent.</p>, <p>As if what he had done was merely something trivial.Bringing his bracelet next to his mouth, he muttered,</p>, <p>\"I'm done here.\"</p>, <p>After that, he went on to take out the detection relic.</p>, <p>He wanted to see if there were any other cadets around that he could target.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>When he did, he was surprised to see a red dot not far from where he was.</p>, <p>\"....Could it be Giel?\"</p>, <p>According to what he knew, the closest one to him was Giel. Last he recalled, his mission was to talk with an undercover agent.</p>, <p>\"He.\"</p>, <p>A small laugh escaped his lips.</p>, <p>\"....He sure has it easy.\"</p>, <p>While it wasn't hard to defeat the cadets, it was no easy work. Arian would much rather be the one to meet the undercover agent. But unfortunately, he wasn't quite familiar with him, so Giel was sent.</p>, <p>\"I still don't know why they put such importance on hi-\"</p>, <p>Beep!</p>, <p>He was just about to finish his sentence when his eyes widened slightly. The signal had been used.</p>, <p>\"What's going on...?\"</p>, <p>The signal was only used in emergencies.</p>, <p>Giel, of all people, was having trouble?</p>, <p>\"Could it be that we have been betrayed?\"</p>, <p>Without a second thought, Arian rushed forward. He didn't need to run very far, with his speed, it took no time to reach Giel. When he did, his eyes widened slightly and his steps paused.</p>, <p>\"What's...\"</p>, <p>Laying down on the side of the wall was what appeared to be Giel's body. Staring at the detection device, Arian saw that it was coming from the body a few feet away from him.</p>, <p>\"It can't be...?\"</p>, <p>Looking shocked, he neared the body.</p>, <p>Amongst the members that had joined, Giel was one of the strongest. It didn't make sense for him to put on an emergency distress signal.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>No, it didn't.</p>, <p>Gradually, Arin's footsteps halted.</p>, <p>Staring at the hooded figure, he raised his hand quickly as a magic circle formed. The process was fast. Within seconds, the circle fully formed, and the temperature around rose.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Immediately after, a large fire spread as it enveloped Giel's body completely.</p>, <p>Swoosh!</p>, <p>The flames roared within the tunnel as they lit up the surroundings. Arian's robes fluttered in the aftermath of the attack.</p>, <p>\"I don't know how you managed to defeat Giel, or if you have at all, but there's no way I'd fall to something like this.\"</p>, <p>While it wasn't obvious at a glance, Arian noticed a few discrepancies. But the biggest factor was the fact that he could notice curse magic from deep within Giel's body. It was thin, almost imperceptible, but he could feel it.</p>, <p>The flames persisted for several seconds before finally they disappeared.</p>, <p>What remained were the charred remains of a body. A small smile tugged at the corner of Arian's lips as he moved ahead.</p>, <p>But just as he did, he stopped.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>Looking around, his expression hardened.</p>, <p>\"W-what in the...?\"</p>, <p>Threads.</p>, <p>The surroundings were covered in thin, threads. Almost every single space was covered with them.</p>, <p>Most shocking was the fact that they had also made their way around his body.</p>, <p>But how...?</p>, <p>How was it possible? Was it because he had been too focused on the corpse that he didn't notice?</p>, <p>....Or was it something else?</p>, <p>\"A-\"</p>, <p>Before he could do anything, the threads shrunk rapidly.</p>, <p>\"Hua!\"</p>, <p>With a shout, he tensed his body and the threads broke. His expression lit up.</p>, <p>'They're weaker than...!'</p>, <p>He wasn't able to stay happy for long as his vision darkened shortly after.</p>, <p>Spurt!</p>, <p>And blood splurted everywhere.</p>, <p>Tok. Tok. Tok.</p>, <p>Gradually, footsteps echoed in the distance. A figure emerged. Coldly staring at the sight before him, Julien retrieved the threads and lowered his hand to place it on top of the corpse.</p>, <p>His indifferent voice echoed shortly afterward.</p>, <p>\"That's two...\"</p>]\n",

With everyone capable of watching the stream from home or in the stadium, the excitement was at an all-time high.</p>, <p>Everything was going smoothly, until...</p>, <p>\"What's going on?\"</p>, <p>Some of the viewers noticed that a certain broadcast was shut off.</p>, <p>\".....Is it just me or I can't follow [Julien and his sidekicks]?\"</p>, <p>While it was impossible for people to individually follow each cadet, since the only people who were granted such privilege were the Chancellors, there were a few exceptions.</p>, <p>The exceptions were the teams that the broadcasters knew could pull large numbers of viewers.</p>, <p>One such team was [Julien and his sidekicks].</p>, <p>Given what had happened beforehand with the interviews, a lot of interest was placed on them. For that reason, they were given a special channel that one could use to follow.</p>, <p>While the broadcast wasn't very interesting due to its slow pace, people still tuned in to watch.</p>, <p> If it wasn't for their skill, then it was for their banter.</p>, <p>—Hey, Kiera. Hey, Kiera... Kieraa~</p>, <p>—Fuck!!! Shut the fuck up for a second. I'm trying to concentrate over here.</p>, <p>—No, but... I've been wondering.</p>, <p>—What?</p>, <p>—Do you have balls?</p>, <p>—....</p>, <p>Especially between Josephine and Kiera who ended up bickering every few minutes.

Why did the broadcast stop?\"</p>, <p>\"It was just about to get interesting too!\"</p>, <p>\"Is it because the viewers were declining? Ah! I was still watching!\"</p>, <p>[We're experiencing technical difficulties, causing the broadcast to halt unexpectedly. Our team is actively investigating the issue to restore service.

This time, it's from another Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>A tall and slender woman with long black hair and glasses approached the man seated behind his desk. He sported a black glove as he nonchalantly flipped through the pages of his book.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>For a brief moment, silence reigned over the room as the only sound that echoed was the sound of the pages flipped.</p>, <p>But gradually, Atlas lifted his head to reply.</p>, <p>\"Tell him we're working on resolving the situation.

As his eyes scanned the words on the book he was reading, he took his eyes away from it.</p>, <p>\"....So no news.\"</p>, <p>While it was arranged for Phecda to meet with another member, the disturbance shouldn't have lasted more than several minutes. The plan was for him to resume the broadcast shortly after.</p>, <p>It was for that reason he chose a rather powerful member. To get things done quickly.</p>, <p>By now, his broadcast should've already been fixed.</p>, <p>....And yet, it wasn't.</p>, <p>\"Something went wrong.\"</p>, <p>But where...?</p>, <p>Could it be possible that Phecda got rid of Giel?</p>, <p>\"No, that's unlikely...\"</p>, <p>Phecda was strong, but Giel was stronger. That being said, it wasn't exactly impossible.</p>, <p>\"Perhaps, he decided to not turn on the stream. Hmm, indeed. Since he now has the map and relic, he might not want to be tracked by the recording device. It might look suspicious in the eyes of the audience and her.\"</p>, <p>That was a possible explanation for the situation.</p>, <p>Of course, it was just one that Atlas thought on the fly. Who knew what the real answer was?</p>, <p>\".....Phecda aside, is everything proceeding smoothly?\"</p>, <p>—Yes, for now, there are no irregularities. Delilah has made her move. She's currently being contained by the Seat below the Genesis.</p>, <p>\"Ah, Aziel.\"</p>, <p>Within the Inverted Sky there were High-Seats and Low-</p>, <p>Seats.</p>, <p>Low-Seats were generally individuals who had the capabilities of becoming a High-Seat. To become a High-Seat, one had to either defeat a High-Seat or become their disciple, eventually taking over their position.</p>, <p>Aziel was the disciple of the Seat of Genesis.</p>, <p>For that reason, his name within the organization was the 'Seat below the Genesis'.</p>, <p>In Atlas's case, he was the Seat of Dawn.</p>, <p>Unlike the Seat of Genesis, he had no disciple or someone he had decided to take over his mantle. There had yet to be someone who could catch his interest.</p>, <p>That being said, no one was interested in taking over his seat through challenge. His power... It was just that dettering.</p>, <p>Fip—</p>, <p>He flipped to the next page of his book.</p>, <p>\"....How long do you think he'll be able to hold on? Even though it's his specialty, Delilah isn't someone that he'll be able to contain for long.\"</p>, <p>—Our estimates are about five hours. Taking into account the fact that she doesn't want to escalate the situation given the large number of audiences and guests, she'll most likely hold back a little. Three hours have already passed. He should be nearing his limit.</p>, <p>\"Five hours? That's better than I expected... I guess I can understand why he's a potential High Seat. But even so, this is longer than I thought. Even I don't have the confidence to hold that woman for that long.\"</p>, <p>—There's no need to worry about that. The Seat below the Genisis isn't the only one we have sent.</p>, <p>\"Oh, is that so...?\"</p>, <p>Well, that made a lot more sense.</p>, <p>\"Th-\"</p>, <p>—Hm....?</p>, <p>A sudden sound disrupted Atlas's words as he looked at the orb.</p>, <p>\"Is something wrong?\"</p>, <p>—.....Yes.</p>, <p>The reply came after a few seconds.</p>, <p>Just as Atalas was about to ask what had happened, the voice beat him to it.</p>, <p>—There has been no movement from several members for the past few hours. Something happened.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Huu... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Hours into their search for Julien, Kiera, Josephine, Luxon, and Anders were on their last breaths as they turned another corner of the Labyrinth. For how long had they been running?</p>, <p>\"H-how long do we need to keep running for...?\"</p>, <p>\"Ha, fuck. I don't know...! I'm just following the fucking thread. Ah fuck!\"</p>, <p>Cursing out loud, Kiera wanted to smack Josephine in the head but found herself unable to do much more besides cursing.</p>, <p>She was exhausted.</p>, <p>It wasn't just her, everyone was exhausted. They had been running for as long as they could remember, and just when she thought they were near to finding him, they would be disappointed to see that he was still nowhere in sight.</p>, <p>\".....Conserve... Haa... energy bullshit.\"</p>, <p>At the rate they were going, they probably wouldn't have any energy to even touch the boss.</p>, <p>\"Bullshit...!\"</p>, <p>Though she complained a lot, Kiera continued to follow the thread.</p>, <p>For some reason, she believed that Julien was waiting for them. It was a crazy thought. One that she beat herself up for the entire time.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>They had just turned a corner and were about to head deeper when all of a sudden, they stopped.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>A figure stood in the middle of the corridor.</p>, <p>He was a familiar figure</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>The figure that they had been chasing after since the very start.</p>, <p>\"F-finally...\"</p>, <p>Josephine exclaimed while leaning against the wall, exhausted.</p>, <p>\"You're okay...?\"</p>, <p>\"What happened... to you...?\"</p>, <p>As the other questioned, he remained still. In Kiera's eyes, he seemed a little off. Setting aside the fact that he was by himself with no hooded figure in sight, his expression was also a little off.</p>, <p>'No, it's not his expression.'</p>, <p>It was his eyes.</p>, <p>They kept flickering. And just subtly, Kiera could also see his expression changing.</p>, <p>'What sort of...'</p>, <p>Kiera couldn't explain it, but it was creepy. Staring at him, she felt every hair on her body stand.</p>, <p>'Why...?'</p>, <p>Why did the scene feel so familiar?</p>, <p>This wasn't the first time she had seen him do something like this. In fact, this was the second time.</p>, <p>And seeing it once again sent shivers down her spine.</p>, <p>'....Why does it look like he's a completely different person?'</p>, <p>From Kiera's perspective, from his demeanor to his gaze and expressions, it seemed as though a complete stranger stood before her. One that was the furthest thing from the Julien she was aware of.</p>, <p>Blinking, his expression changed again.</p>, <p>So did his demenour.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Yet again, Kiera saw a different person.</p>, <p>He blinked again.</p>, <p>His expression changed again. And so did his demeanor.</p>, <p>Three blinks, three people.</p>, <p>\"Crazy.\"</p>, <p>No, creepy</p>, <p>\"Julien...?\"</p>, <p>This all eventually stopped until Josephine called out for him. Blinking again, he turned his head and Kiera met his gaze.</p>, <p>Yet again, Kiera found herself unable to associate the Julien she knew with the one that stood in front of her.</p>, <p>Before her stood a stranger she knew nothing about.</p>, <p>However, that quickly changed after he blinked again, and his gaze returned to the one she was familiar with.</p>, <p>\".....You guys are here.\"</p>, <p>His voice came out rather hoarse.</p>, <p>However, as if noticing this, he massaged his throat before looking into the distance.</p>, <p>\"We don't have much time. We should go.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>\"What? What do you mean we should go?\"</p>, <p>At Josephine's and Luxon's stunned voices, Julien looked at them briefly before massaging his neck.</p>, <p>\"The boss. We're near.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>I felt my face twitch slightly.</p>, <p>It was an involuntary reaction. Something that I couldn't control. Staring ahead, the world seemed a little bit blurry. It switched between clarity and blurriness.</p>, <p>.....I felt sick.</p>, <p>And my head throbbed.</p>, <p>Even so, I had to keep moving forward.</p>, <p>\"Boss monster?....What do you mean we're near? How do you know?\"</p>, <p>\"I can feel it.\"</p>, <p>No, that was a lie.</p>, <p>I could just see it from the map. It was also for this very reason that I had led them here.</p>, <p>\"....Wait, what? You can feel it? What sort of nonsense is this?\"</p>, <p>I turned to look behind me.</p>, <p>Standing just a few feet from me were my team members. They were all looking at me with incredulous looks. I couldn't blame them.</p>, <p>I was just about to speak when Luxon interrupted.</p>, <p>\"Before any of that, can you explain what happened?\"</p>, <p>His deep voice echoed within the confines of the corridor of the Labyrinth.</p>, <p>\"You were suddenly dragged by a hooded figure and then all of a sudden we found you here, claiming that you can feel the boss. How does this make sense? At least explain what's going on?\"</p>, <p>His words were met with a wave of nods as Kiera and the rest seemed to be on the same page as him. I looked at them for a short moment before nodding my head.</p>, <p>\"....Fair.\"</p>, <p>Looks like they didn't buy it.</p>, <p>Rummaging through my pocket, I took out a small map and came out clean.</p>, <p>\"I managed to get my hands on this.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>At first, everyone was confused by the map. However, shortly after, their expressions changed.</p>, <p>\"A map?\"</p>, <p>\"Wait, hold on... Look at the lines.\"</p>, <p>As if realizing what kind of map it was, their eyes widened. Pointing at it, Josephine stuttered slightly.</p>, <p>\"H-how did you get this?\"</p>, <p>Everyone raised their heads to stare at me. Taking in their expressions, I answered,</p>, <p>\"From the hooded figure.\"</p>, <p>\"....The fuck?\"</p>, <p>I raised my hand to show them my bracelet.</p>, <p>\"I'm not entirely sure about what's happening. However, it seems like we're currently under attack.\"</p>, <p>I went on to press the emergency button on the bracelet. When nothing happened, everyone blinked. They then looked at me strangely.</p>, <p>The first one to speak was Anders who stared at his bracelet with a frown.</p>, <p>\"We already knew. We tried using the bracelet the moment that you were taken. However, it didn't work for any of us.\"</p>, <p> \"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Right. That made sense.</p>, <p>In any case,</p>, <p>\"I was able to get the map from the hooded figure.\"</p>, <p>Yet again, everyone blinked.</p>, <p>Staring at me with a frown, Luxon deeply said,</p>, <p>\"You were able to beat him?\"</p>, <p>Judging from his tone, he didn't seem to particularly believe him.</p>, <p>I couldn't blame him.</p>, <p>\".....Don't get me wrong, but last I recall, he was very powerful. How in the world did you manage to beat him.\"</p>, <p>\"I had help. I met a few cadets along the way.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>Seeing the way Kiera was looking at me, it was obvious that she didn't believe my story. I shrugged.</p>, <p>\"If the map is correct the boss is only a few corridors away. If you don't believe me you can test it.\"</p>, <p>Kiera's eyes narrowed, and I stared back without saying a word.</p>, <p>It was Josephine's voice that broke the silence between the two of us.</p>, <p>\"We should try it.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Finally, Kiera took her eyes away from me and looked at the map. Then, staring at it for a few seconds, she clicked her tongue.</p>, <p>\"Alright, fine\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, hey!\"</p>, <p>Snatching the map from Josephine, she held it in front of her and proceeded forward. As she passed me, she mumbled,</p>, <p>\".....I still owe you, so.\"</p>, <p>And proceeded to leave with that. Confused, I stared at her back.</p>, <p>'Owe? What did she owe me for....?'</p>, <p>\"Wait, Kiera! Wait for me!\"</p>, <p>The others were quick to follow her from behind. I could tell from their expressions that they had many questions in their minds, but chose to keep them to themselves. In all honesty, it was my fault.</p>, <p>I was currently not in the right state of mind to come up with a plausible excuse. Thankfully, they had left things here.</p>, <p>Otherwise, I really wasn't sure how to explain myself.</p>, <p>Standing still, I stared at their backs for a short moment before taking out the radar. There, I could see a few blue dots.</p>, <p>\"The other teams are close.\"</p>, <p>But they were still a little behind. We were first.</p>, <p>Putting the relic back into my pockets, I slowly retrieved a small gray pill from my pocket.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>It felt smooth to the touch. Almost like a pearl.</p>, <p>Orphion.</p>, <p>A powerful drug that served to boost the consumer's power significantly. It was the drug that was supposed to be handed to the boss monster just before the cadets arrived at it. While the pill was powerful, it had strong side effects.</p>, <p>For that reason, the pill was supposed to be handed to the beast just before the cadets arrived.</p>, <p>That was the original plan.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>It was now in my possession.</p>, <p>Raising my head slightly, I stared at the others before placing the pill in my mouth. I didn't eat it quite just yet.</p>, <p>....I needed a proper audience for that.</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>A large chamber sat in the middle of the Labyrinth. It was where the boss monster was located. Inside a large room with a tall ceiling, a gigantic mammoth-like creature with long tusks and tremendous pressure sat in the middle.</p>, <p>With torches scattered around the room casting a dim light over the surroundings, the place looked extremely eerie.</p>, <p>Surrounding the hall were over a dozen different entrances.</p>, <p>Coming out of one, Kiera whispered.</p>, <p>\"....Looks like you were right. We're the first ones here. How should we proceed?\"</p>, <p>Staring at the monster's head, I didn't answer immediately.</p>, <p>I could tell from just standing where I was that it was extremely powerful. Perhaps, it was even just as strong as Giel.</p>, <p>Imagining its strength with the drug sent shivers down my spine.</p>, <p>'No wonder they were confident. There's no way any cadet can deal with that monster if it took the drug.'</p>, <p>It also made me understand just why the rewards of the quest were so good.</p>, <p>Indeed, if I allowed the incident to happen, then I didn't see how anyone would come out of it unscathed.</p>, <p>\"Oy.\"</p>, <p>In fact, a lot of cadets were probably going to die.</p>, <p>\"Oy!\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Lowering my head, Kiera's face appeared just a few inches away from mine.</p>, <p>Staring into her deep red eyes, I was momentarily taken aback by her appearance. It went without saying that her looks were on another level.</p>, <p>However, I was quick to push down such thoughts.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\".....What do you mean what?\"</p>, <p>Kiera's head flicked towards the beast.</p>, <p>\"I said, what's the plan? As much, as I hate it, you're the team leader. Tell us exactly what we're supposed to do.\"</p>, <p>\"....About that.\"</p>, <p>I suddenly looked towards the distance.</p>, <p>Towards one of the other entrances.</p>, <p>\"We'll have to first think about how to deal with them.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"We're here.\"</p>, <p>Spotting the center of the maze, Johnathan and his team rushed forward without caution.</p>, <p>Their journey so far had been rather smooth, and staring at the leaderboard, he could see that they were a close second to the Haven team.</p>, <p>— [Team Score] —</p>, <p>[Dream Catcher] - 3915 Points</p>, <p>[Swords of Fiest] - 3901 Points</p>, <p>[Crow's Dance] - 3871 Points</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>— [Team Score] —</p>, <p>\"Get ready to engage. If we defeat the boss, we'll be able to cinch first place.\"</p>, <p>According to Johnathan's calculations, they were probably the first team to reach the boss. The fact that he couldn't hear any fighting in the distance seemed to further fuel his hypothesis.</p>, <p>....But just as they neared the entrance of the middle area, Johnathan heard the soft sound of footsteps coming from behind.</p>, <p>Turning his head, his brows furrowed at the sight that greeted him.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Neither side said a single word as they stared at each other. Instantly, heavy tension plunged the space as Johnathan's gaze fell on Aoife, who stood indifferently.</p>, <p>Just as the tension was reaching its breaking point, Aoife opened her mouth.</p>, <p>\"Now's not the time to fight.\"</p>, <p>Her voice was crisp, sounding rather pleasant to the ears.</p>, <p>Staring in the distance, she walked ahead calmly.</p>, <p>As she did, she passed Johnathan's group without a single care in the world.</p>, <p>In the briefest of moments, Johnathan was tempted to attack her exposed back, but just as the thought came, he felt a slight chill at the back of his neck and turned around.</p>, <p>There, two gray eyes stared at him.</p>, <p>'....Who is he?'</p>, <p>He appeared to be an unfamiliar face. No, rather, after a bit of thought, he remembered and his expression changed slightly.</p>, <p>'Right, there was someone else ranked higher than Aoife. It must be him.'</p>, <p>It was interesting.</p>, <p>Haven's ranking system. The more Johnathan thought about it, the more flawed it appeared to him.</p>, <p>'It's almost as if they are making fun of everyone.'</p>, <p>Ridiculous.</p>, <p>Especially when taking into account just how weak the current Black Star was.</p>, <p>He was pathetically weak.</p>, <p>How was someone that weak ahead of these two?</p>, <p>Taking into account just how powerful the two, no three... there was another powerful one. Johnathan suddenly spoke.</p>, <p>\".....I have a proposition.\"</p>, <p>His words immediately attracted the attention of all present as they looked at him.</p>, <p>Taking note of their gazes, Aoife's especially, he went on to say,</p>, <p>\"Let's work together until we defeat the boss. It's no use fighting here before getting to the boss. Since it seems like we're the first two teams, if we work together, we can get rid of it fast before heading for the exit. We won't have to go through the hassle of fighting against the other teams if we do this.\"</p>, <p>His words were mixed with half-truths.</p>, <p>While it was true that the faster they beat the boss, the less annoying things would be down the line, the real reason why he wanted to fight together was because he wanted to observe his opponents before fighting them.</p>, <p>Currently, he wasn't very confident in defeating them. Especially not when they had three people of similar strength to his with one just being a tad bit weaker.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>Things would be different if he had more information on them.</p>, <p>So long as he knew about them...</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>Aoife's voice broke him out of his thoughts. Lifting his head, he looked at her with a surprised look.</p>, <p>\"Just like that?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>A surprising turn of events.</p>, <p>Johnathan previously thought he'd have to do more to convince them, but it seemed like they were more reasonable than he thought.</p>, <p>With that, the two groups headed for the main chamber together.</p>, <p>Of course, the two groups were still wary of each other. For now, it was all just a verbal agreement. Who knew when the other side would backstab them?</p>, <p>\"....Huh?\"</p>, <p>They had just arrived at the main chamber when Aoife's steps paused. Her expression hardened slightly.</p>, <p>It was an expression of graveness.</p>, <p>'What's going on?'</p>, <p>Following her line of sight, Johnathan's eyes jumped. Off in the distance, he caught sight of another group.</p>, <p>They too had noticed their appearance.</p>, <p>'How could this be?'</p>, <p>Stunned, Johnathan looked at the group.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>But upon spotting a familiar figure, his worries were immediately swept.</p>, <p>'....So it's him.'</p>, <p>The Black Star. Lowering his head and staring at his bracelet, he looked at their points and almost chuckled.</p>, <p>450 Points.</p>, <p>A far cry from theirs.</p>, <p>Still, it wasn't as though Johnathan completely disregarded them. As his expression fixed on the platinum-haired girl, he somewhat frowned.</p>, <p>Kiera was it?</p>, <p>She was someone to look out for. But even so, he could deal with her.</p>, <p>\"So-\"</p>, <p>He had just turned around to address the other group when he stopped. Suddenly, his expression changed when he noticed Leon staring ahead with a similar expression to Aoife.</p>, <p>\"What...?\"</p>, <p>Stunned, he looked to see that they were both staring at the black star with grave expressions.</p>, <p>Blinking, he couldn't understand why they were looking at him like that. However, before he could say anything else, Leon spoke.</p>, <p>\"....As expected. He's here.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The recording devices picked up the entire exchange.</p>, <p>On the projections available to all citizens, and those above the arena grounds, three groups appeared from the sides of the main chamber.</p>, <p>They all stood still while staring at each other.</p>, <p>A tense atmosphere suddenly enshrouded the surroundings. Be it within the chamber, and outside.</p>, <p>All spectators stared at the scene with bathed breaths.</p>, <p>In the middle, a colossal figure resembling a large elephant appeared. It towered over everyone, restrained by heavy chains binding its legs, it remained at the center while all attention was directed towards it.</p>, <p>What particularly captured onlookers' attention was the creature's partially decaying form, illuminated by a subtle purple glow emanating from its body and the surrounding torches.</p>, <p>\"It's disgusting.\"</p>, <p>\"Uck...!\"</p>, <p>Just looking at the creature sent chills down the spine the audience's spine.

All eyes focused on him as he looked towards Aoife.</p>, <p>Immediately, the audience became rowdy.</p>, <p>\"What do you mean what do you plan on doing?\"</p>, <p>\"Get rid of the third group before attacking that beast!\"</p>, <p>\"They're the weakest group! There's no point in working together with them.

Hold them back.]</p>, <p>[What? Let's take care of them firs-]</p>, <p>Johnathan's voice was interrupted by Aoife's gaze. The way she looked at him was as though she was looking at a fool.</p>, <p>[.....Tell your team to keep an eye on them. If they make a move, you can try to stop them or have your team delay them.]</p>, <p>[Delay? What are yo-]</p>, <p>His words were cut off as Aoife extended her hands outwardly before squeezing them together.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, the surroundings shook and the chains around the mammoth rattled. Its eyes, which had been closed the entire time flared open to reveal its inky black eyes that seemed to suck everything its gaze fell on.</p>, <p> [Rumble Rumble—]</p>, <p>The surroundings shook yet again. This time, with even more ferocity. The creature slowly stood up raising its head proudly as it growled in the air.</p>, <p>[Weeeeee—!]</p>, <p>Its growl echoed loudly, making some of the audience members flinch.</p>, <p>A figure blurred above it all of a sudden, appearing just above it.</p>, <p>It was so fast that the audience was barely able to see it. Thankfully, the broadcast was able to slow the projection down.</p>, <p>\"Wow...!\"</p>, <p>\"Ah!\"</p>, <p>With a roar of excitement from the crowd, the projection gradually slowed, revealing two familiar gray eyes and a glowing sword. It was none other than Leon. With his looks, and rank within the Haven Academy, he was amongst the more popular male candidates amongst the masses.</p>, <p>With a decisive swing, his blade descended, cleaving down upon the enormous creature beneath him.</p>, <p>[BANG—!]</p>, <p>The recording device shook slightly from the aftermath of the attack as shockwave swept the surroundings.</p>, <p>Once the sound cleared everyone was stunned to see the creature to be completely fine.</p>, <p>\"Whaaaa?\"</p>, <p>\"So strong...!\"</p>, <p>\"Wait, look!\"</p>, <p>As the confusion settled, amidst the collective belief that Leon's attack had done nothing, a handful of attentive spectators caught sight of a small dent on the creature's thick tusk.</p>, <p>\"There's a dent...!\"</p>, <p>\"Ah!\"</p>, <p>Similarly catching the dent, Leon took a deep breath and pressed his foot against the creature's tusk as he stood on top of it.</p>, <p>[BANG—!]</p>, <p>Leon's attack was followed by another.</p>, <p>And then another.</p>, <p>[BANG—!]</p>, <p>The resounding echo reverberated throughout the arena grounds, enveloping the spectators in an immersive sensation that made it seem as though they were relieving the entire experience through the lenses of the participating cadets.</p>, <p>Just as Leon was about to slash again, the creature let out a shrill cry and stomped the ground.</p>, <p>[Weeeeee—!]</p>, <p>The chamber shook fiercely, and Leon was sent flying back.</p>, <p>\"Ah!\"</p>, <p>\"No!!\"</p>, <p>Panic erupted among the audience as Leon's figure was flung backward, hurtling towards the wall with alarming speed. Yet, moments before impact, his body abruptly halted in mid-air.</p>, <p>Before the audience could understand what had happened, Leon lowered his head to glance at Aoife whose face was twisted.</p>, <p>[.....Go again.]</p>, <p>And then, waving her hand, his body shot forward at rapid speeds.</p>, <p>[Kracka! Kracka!]</p>, <p>Bolts of lightning erupted from above, striking the creature's body with incredible force, etching scorched marks upon its surface upon impact.</p>, <p>[Hieeek—!]</p>, <p>The creature roared with pain as its trucks trashed around, sending a few cadets flying away in the process. Even Leon wasn't spared as he was unfortunately unable to reach it as he skidded back several meters.</p>, <p>[Haaa... Haa...]</p>, <p>In the process, the audience could hear his rough breathing as he looked ahead at the creature with a solemn look.</p>, <p>Then, gripping his sword, he whispered something to himself.</p>, <p>His voice was just loud enough for the recording devices to pick up as his voice gently echoed within the confines of the arena grounds.</p>, <p>[.....We've hardly scratched it.]</p>, <p>And indeed, upon closer look, despite everything that had happened, the creature looked relatively fine.</p>, <p>It was then that the audience understood the severity of the situation.</p>, <p>This...</p>, <p>....Was this creature even possible to defeat?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>I stared at the scene in front of me with nothing but amazement. Leon, Aoife, Evelyn... They were all amazing.</p>, <p>I could just stand where I was and admire their fights for hours on end.</p>, <p>They were good.</p>, <p>Brilliant.</p>, <p>Amazing...</p>, <p>There were no words that I could use to describe how amazing they were.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I rolled the pill in my mouth. It had no taste and simply felt like a smooth pearl.</p>, <p>Orphion. The drug was originally meant to be used on the mammoth-like creature in the distance. Ultimately, I took it. The pill had the effect of boosting one's strength for a while. However, at the same time, it also had severe consequences.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I was willing to face the consequences.</p>, <p>For my future, I had to do it.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>As the pill rolled around my mouth, my eyes focused on the recording devices in the distance. They were currently floating in the air, capturing the creature and everything around it.</p>, <p>Me included.</p>, <p>I stared at it and took a good long look at it.</p>, <p>'You're watching, aren't you?'</p>, <p>I was talking to the audience.</p>, <p>Perhaps, they weren't. I wouldn't blame them if they weren't looking at me.</p>, <p>But that was fine.</p>, <p>I was going to grab their attention soon.</p>, <p>I had a tale to tell.</p>, <p>One that involved ten people.</p>, <p>Ten people that all looked different, spoke different, had different backgrounds, and yet, despite their differences, they were the same.</p>, <p>It was a tale that I needed to tell.</p>, <p>To the audience, and for myself.</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, I bit the pill in my mouth.</p>, <p>Cra Crack—</p>, <p>Instantly, I felt my body tremble slightly. It was as if a volcano had suddenly erupted inside of my body.</p>, <p>It was hot.</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip!</p>, <p>Sweat dripped down from the side of my face.</p>, <p>.....The change was subtle, but it was still picked up by Kiera and the others who looked at me in shock.</p>, <p>\"Julien?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? What...\"</p>, <p>Before they could say anything more, I stared at them and nodded silently. A silent sign of assurance. In the process, I tried to make it seem as though I was fine.</p>, <p>However, I was anything but fine.</p>, <p>The pain I was currently experiencing. It was hard to describe.</p>, <p>But pain... I could handle pain.</p>, <p>And it was with such thoughts that I took my first step forward.</p>, <p>Tok—</p>, <p>That tale.</p>, <p>It was time for me to tell it.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Bang—! Skidding a few meters back, Johnathan eventually came to a stop.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>His breath was labored, and his mana was running rampant. Staring ahead and seeing Aoife's group, he clenched his sword and pushed himself forward.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>His sword cleaved at the exact spot where Leon had hacked during his first strike. Exactly as his sword made contact with the tusk, Johnathan felt his entire hand go numb.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>Cr-Crack—! His expression grew excited as he noticed fine miniature webs forming around the tusk.</p>, <p>\"A-almost...!\"</p>, <p>He was just about to follow up when the creature jerked, and Johnathan was thrown a few meters back.</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>His back smashed against the wall, and he felt a sweet sensation at the back of his throat.</p>, <p>\"Cough! Cough...!\"</p>, <p>'....This, it's so strong '</p>, <p>He wasn't the only one struggling. Staring ahead, Johnathan could see that the combined effort from the two teams was hardly doing anything to the creature. It was at that moment that they understood just how meaningless their plan was.</p>, <p>.....There was simply no way for them to get rid of the creature fast.</p>, <p>'Ah, at this rate, things will become more troublesome.'</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Johnathan's sword started to glow as he glared at the mammoth.</p>, <p>Looking around him, and seeing that everyone was struggling to deal with the creature, he was prepared to use one of his strongest moves when all of a sudden he felt a chill coming down from behind him.</p>, <p>\".....?\"</p>, <p>It wasn't just him.</p>, <p>The others felt it as well.</p>, <p>Looking back, a peculiar figure stood. He stood still, his clothes fluttering slightly alongside his hair as he stared at the mammoth with cold eyes.</p>, <p>\"W-what are you doing...?\"</p>, <p>Johnathan's voice came out hoarse. Having exhausted a lot of his mana, he could hardly speak properly.</p>, <p>Johnathan was just about to tell him to get away so that he wouldn't be a hindrance when he noticed his expression.</p>, <p>It was flickering continuously.</p>, <p>From the angle of his lips, the intensity of his gaze, and his expressions. They kept flickering into different intensities. Almost as if he was trying to replicate different people.</p>, <p>\"What in the...\"</p>, <p>Before Johnathan knew it, the glow around his sword had diminished.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Julien's current appearance seemed to suck away the energy out of him.</p>, <p>He didn't understand it at first, but lowering his head, he stared at his hands.</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>....They were trembling.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>His breathing started to grow rapidly. When he looked up again, Julien's expression had changed again. His eyes, they were empty. Devoid of any light.</p>, <p>And then...</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Before Johnathan knew it, threads appeared to surround the place. Covering every inch of the surroundings, everyone stopped.</p>, <p>All eyes fell on him then.</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Johnathan stopped circulating his mana as the sword in his hand stopped glowing.</p>, <p>In that moment,realization finally dawned on him. The reason for Aoife's words, and Haven's rankings.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>Why he was ranked first.</p>, <p>\"....What is this?\"</p>, <p>It all finally made sense to him.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"H-help... me. I'm scared..\"</p>, <p>Within a dark cave, a boy cried. He looked no older than eight, and he held his legs with both hands.</p>, <p>\"Waa...!\"</p>, <p>\"Uha!\"</p>, <p>In the distance, he could hear the cries of the other children. Hugging his legs tightly, he hugged his body tightly.</p>, <p>'Where am I...?'</p>, <p>'What's going on?'</p>, <p>'I'm scared.'</p>, <p>Such was Leonard's first memory at the Inverted Sky.</p>, <p>From then on he was subjected to endless torture.</p>, <p>\"...I'm sorry...\"</p>, <p>He was beaten.</p>, <p>\"It... h-urts... It's my fault... Don't hit me.\"</p>, <p>He was forced to repeat the same words each day.</p>, <p>\"For the inverted sky!\"</p>, <p>And he couldn't remember the number of times he had starved.</p>, <p>\"I'm hungry.\"</p>, <p>Everyday.</p>, <p>\"....Sorry \"</p>, <p>Life was hell.</p>, <p>'Ah... I can't do this anymore... It hurts...'</p>, <p>\"Hic... Hic...\"</p>, <p>His cries echoed quietly as he wept to himself.</p>, <p>\"....H-here.\"</p>, <p>That was when another child approached him.</p>, <p>Holding onto a piece of bread, he handed it to Leonard. Raising his head, Leonard stared at the bread. He blinked, unable to understand what was going on.</p>, <p>\"F-or me?\"</p>, <p>\"....Yes.\"</p>, <p>That was when Leonard first met Giel.</p>, <p>He was taller than the other children. He was also smarter. He'd give them his share of the food whenever someone was hungry.</p>, <p>It didn't take long for him to become the group leader.</p>, <p>But even then...</p>, <p>He could only help out so much. Even as he starved, and took beatings over the other children, the number of children within the group dwindled.</p>, <p>What at first had been a group of over one hundred children slowly turned into a group of thirty.</p>, <p>\"I'm hungry...\"</p>, <p> \"My stomach hurts.\"</p>, <p>\"It hurts... M-mom... I-want to go home.\"</p>, <p>\"Here.\"</p>, <p>Giel continued to hand over his food. Even as his stomach roared in pain, and his arms were so thin you could see the bones, he gave his food to those who needed it the most.</p>, <p>\"H-here.\"</p>, <p>Leonard followed after his example.</p>, <p>But even then...</p>, <p>The deaths continued.</p>, <p>In the end, only ten managed to survive.</p>, <p>\"From this moment forth, you will be the Dragon Charred Unit.\"</p>, <p>Giel, Arian, Jacob, Clyde, Laura, Johanna, Karl, Rowan, Evan, and Leonard. These were the names of the members.</p>, <p>They were the last remaining survivors of the first trial.</p>, <p>Having survived, they had now become full-fledged members of the Inverted Sky. Because of the shared trauma, they were close to each other.</p>, <p>\"Have mine...\"</p>, <p>\"Take my towel.\"</p>, <p>When one suffered, the other would sacrifice their comfort to help the other. It was like this that they carried forward.</p>, <p>In his time with them, it was a certain conversation that struck deeply with Leonard.</p>, <p>Sitting by a bonfire, he remembered asking,</p>, <p>\"Do you remember your families?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\".....No.\"</p>, <p>\"I do not.\"</p>, <p>As the flames from the fire reflected in the eyes of the children, one of them spoke.</p>, <p>\"I do.\"</p>, <p>It was Laura. The second youngest of the group.</p>, <p>With an expression he had never seen her make, she went on to say,</p>, <p>\"My mom. I think she had blonde hair and green eyes. I don't remember much, but I remember that she was warm. Like this fire. But it doesn't hurt like this one. I don't know where she is.\"</p>, <p>Looking up, she asked,</p>, <p>\"Do you think she still remembers me?\"</p>, <p>Crackle!</p>, <p>The fire crackled as the members remained silent for a brief moment.</p>, <p>Giel was the one who ended up answering as he threw a wooden stick to the fire.</p>, <p>\"....Maybe.\"</p>, <p>To Leonard, Giel was an enigma. He was kind and helpful, but at the same time, ruthless when it was necessary.</p>, <p>He was a person whom he found hard to understand.</p>, <p>But at the same time... He was someone he looked up to.</p>, <p>Just what were his true thoughts...?</p>, <p>\"I want to meet her.\"</p>, <p>\"You will.\"</p>, <p>Another member said, staring at the fire.</p>, <p>\"Once we reach a higher rank we'll get more freedom. By then, you should be able to meet your mother.\"</p>, <p>\"I will help you.\"</p>, <p>\"....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>The group was united. They had to be. They had only each other left.</p>, <p>That conversation became an irreplaceable memory to Leonard.</p>, <p>From then on the group worked together. They followed a similar routine. They would wake up. Train. Eat. Receive missions. Return, and repeat.</p>, <p>\"Let's keep going.\"</p>, <p>\".....Just hang in there for a little longer.\"</p>, <p>\"Ugh, Laura, you aren't a very good cook.\"</p>, <p>\"Then you cook!\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, well... I'm kind of lazy.\"</p>, <p>\"Then shut up and eat.\"</p>, <p>\"Hey! That's my bedsheet.\"</p>, <p>\"Whatever.\"</p>, <p>\"Here, have mine.\"</p>, <p>\"No, I want his.\"</p>, <p>\"Damn it!\"</p>, <p>\"Hahaha.\"</p>, <p>Their lives were slowly starting to get better. But... to Leonard, there was still something that he felt was missing about that life.</p>, <p>He couldn't quite explain it.</p>, <p>.....Every time he would go out for a mission, he'd feel that something was missing.</p>, <p>It only hit him in his latest mission.</p>, <p>They had fully grown up now. No longer were they children.</p>, <p>Standing further back from the crowd, Leonard stared at the sea of people heading for the stadium when he mumbled,</p>, <p>\"....I envy them.\"</p>, <p>The members turned their heads to stare at him. Unlike in the past, they were all different. No longer did they seem as hopeful as they once did.</p>, <p>They looked like a shell of what they had in the past.</p>, <p>After everything they had been through, it was hard for them to not lose their humanity. But even then, they were the only ones Leonard had left.</p>, <p>\"You envy them? Why?\"</p>, <p>Why...?</p>, <p>Leonard looked at the crowd.</p>, <p>\".....Look at them. All those people. They're all here to watch them.\"</p>, <p>\"Them?\"</p>, <p>\"The cadets.\"</p>, <p>\".....Ah.\"</p>, <p>A strange silence befell the group shortly after. As all members turned their heads to stare at the audience, Leonard asked,</p>, <p>\"What do you think it's like?\"</p>, <p>He nudged at them with his chin.</p>, <p>\".....The acknowledgment of one's existence. How do you think it feels?\"</p>, <p>In a world where the only ones who knew about their existence were each other, how did it feel to be acknowledged?</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>I pondered over Leonard's question for a very long time.</p>, <p>Looking around me and seeing everyone looking at me, I felt the center of everyone's attention. But even then. Even though I stood before them. I wasn't really there.</p>, <p>.....I was merely an abstract image of Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>They were looking at me, but not the real me. In a way, the story resonated with me. It was hard to keep going when nobody truly looked at you.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I didn't need people to look at me.</p>, <p>I was fine with what I had. There was a goal that I had in mind. One that I had to accomplish regardless of how much it hurt.</p>, <p>....and it was exactly because of such thoughts that I was able to push away the current pain that I was experiencing.</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>The pain...</p>, <p>It was eroding every part of my body. From my muscles to my internal organs. I could feel a boiling heat from deep within me.</p>, <p>I could feel the pain swell with each second that passed. My stomach started to bloat, and I started to feel stiff.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>The energy that was accumulating inside my core was threatening to take over my entire body.</p>, <p>I needed to let go of it.</p>, <p>Let it out.</p>, <p>Looking around and seeing everyone desperately fighting against the mammoth, I took in their struggling expressions.</p>, <p>It was obvious that they were having a hard time defeating the beast.</p>, <p>It looked imposing from where I was.</p>, <p>Powerful...</p>, <p>Tok--</p>, <p>I took my first step forward.</p>, <p>As I did, I extended my hand. The one thing that limited me each time was the lack of mana. However, things were different now. Mana. I had plenty of it. So much so that my body was starting to break down as a result of how much I had.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa...\"</p>, <p>As my breath grew labored, threads started to emerge from my forearm. One, two, three, four, five... ten.</p>, <p>\"More...\"</p>, <p>I could feel it.</p>, <p>With the amount of mana I had, I could create more threads.</p>, <p>I wanted to see it.</p>, <p>Just how many threads could I create with the amount of energy that I had?</p>, <p>\"Twenty.\"</p>, <p>No, I could do more...</p>, <p>Even as my body started to heat up, I squeezed everything out of me.</p>, <p>Shhh—</p>, <p>\"....Thirty.\"</p>, <p>Such were the number of threads that were currently enveloping my arm. Staring into the distance, I focused my attention on the recording device hovering in the air.</p>, <p>I took a good look at it before closing my eyes.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath and sunk my consciousness within.</p>, <p>....There I could feel four other faint personalities trying to take over. However, I didn't let them.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>In the silence that took over my mind, I slowly opened my eyes again. When I did, I found the entire world before me covered in threads.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>Looking ahead, I could see everyone's attention fixed on me.</p>, <p>From the recording device to everyone else that was within the room. At that moment, they were all looking at me.</p>, <p>I was the center of everyone's attention.</p>, <p>I...</p>, <p>....Was existing.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Everything happened so fast that nobody knew how to react. In one moment, Aoife and Johnathan's team were struggling, and in the next moment, they stopped. It wasn't as though they wanted to stop.</p>, <p>It was more like...</p>, <p>...They had to stop.</p>, <p>[W-what is this?]</p>, <p>[Threads?]</p>, <p>Covering every inch of the chamber were threads. They surrounded the entire space without leaving anyone with any room to move.</p>, <p>\"What's going on...?\"</p>, <p>\"What the hell is this?\"</p>, <p>The unexpected change caught the audience off guard, prompting some to stand up for a better view of the projection above. However, just as they were trying to understand the situation, the recording device suddenly focused on a certain individual.</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>He stood still at the center without saying a single word. He just stood there, and yet, the moment the recording device stopped on him, he seemed to suck the very air out of the surroundings.</p>, <p>\"It's him...\"</p>, <p>\"....What is he doing?\"</p>, <p>It was a figure that most people were already aware of.</p>, <p>Having witnessed his play, they were all too familiar with him. He was a sort of celebrity.</p>, <p>Back then, he had gripped the attention of the world with his acting. This time, he grabbed their attention for a different reason.</p>, <p>\"...How?\"</p>, <p>\"The threads... They are coming from him?\"</p>, <p>It was hard for the audience to make heads or tails of what was happening. Before his stream had turned off, everyone saw his group. It was nothing special.</p>, <p>Due to technical errors, their stream shut off and everyone turned to look at the other groups that were possible to watch.</p>, <p>Everyone had forgotten about them.</p>, <p>Him.</p>, <p>.....With how everyone had been performing, it wasn't hard to forget about him.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Staring at the very scene before them, the audience found themselves unable to tear their gazes away from him.</p>, <p>If they could forget about him before, they couldn't now.</p>, <p>He was deeply etched in their minds.</p>, <p>[Tok—]</p>, <p>The singular sound of his footstep echoed within the confines of the projection as he stepped forward.</p>, <p>As he did, the other cadets remained still.</p>, <p>It wasn't because they were scared, but simply put, they couldn't. The threads. Despite being so thin, they looked sturdy.</p>, <p>[Weeee—]</p>, <p>The silence shattered as the mammoth emitted a thunderous growl, its piercing cry echoing through the air as it fixed its gaze upon Julien.</p>, <p>Snap! Snap! Snap!</p>, <p>As it moved, the threads snapped.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>\"Ah!\"</p>, <p>The audience screamed as they watched this. It was a scene they were familiar with. Just moments prior, all the other cadets struggled to even put a dent in the creature's body.</p>, <p>The same could be said to be true for the threads which appeared to not affect the mammoth's body.</p>, <p>[....]</p>, <p>Standing still, Julien started at the incoming creature. He didn't seem particularly bothered by the mammoth.</p>, <p>Bringing his hand forward, he clenched his hand.</p>, <p>The threads compressed into the mammoth who let out a shrill cry.</p>, <p>[Weeee—]</p>, <p>Blood splurted everywhere.</p>, <p>But even so, it continued to change forward.</p>, <p>Snap! Snap! Snap!</p>, <p>10 meters.</p>, <p>[....]</p>, <p>Julien remained still.</p>, <p>8 meters.</p>, <p>[Weeee—]</p>, <p>The creature neared yet again.</p>, <p>Even so, Julien remained still. The audience watched this with bathed breath as they clenched their hands against the seats tightly.</p>, <p>While he stood motionless, a certain voice floated in Julien's mind as he stared at the incoming mammoth.</p>, <p>'I'm tired.'</p>, <p>It was the continuation of Leonard's speech.</p>, <p>'And it's not the type of tiredness that sleep can fix. I'm tired of not existing. Not knowing whether, besides you guys, a person out there even acknowledges my existence. You guys also feel it, don't you? That we're slowly fading away.'</p>, <p>6 meters.</p>, <p>It drew nearer to him. Its massive presence loomed over Julien as the audience looked at the scene with widened eyes and looks of horror.</p>, <p>\"Oh no!\"</p>, <p>\"Ah!! Get away...!\"</p>, <p>But he didn't. Julien remained standing where he was, his expression changing again as he took on a new persona.</p>, <p>'.....It feels empty. I feel empty. I don't know why. I just feel this way. And it's sucking me deeper and deeper each day that I keep on living.'</p>, <p>4 meters.</p>, <p>It was now practically in front of Julien.</p>, <p>\"Akh..!\"</p>, <p>Some of the audience wanted to close their eyes. They wanted to look away from the bloody scene that was inevitably going to happen.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>For some reason, everyone kept their eyes fixed on him. It was as if their eyes were glued on him, making them unable to tear their gazes away.</p>, <p>'So if you ask me why I'm envious, it's because I don't get to have the privilege of even knowing what's it like to know I exist. I'm just a shadow. An endlessly drifting piece of nothing.'</p>, <p>2 meters.</p>, <p>[Weeee—]</p>, <p>The mammoth roared.</p>, <p>Its body elevated from the ground as its foot drew near to him.</p>, <p>'....I am nothing.'</p>, <p>And then...</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>The mammoth fell flat a few inches before Julien. Around it were over a dozen purple threads. The audience started at the scene in shock. The same was true for the cadets.</p>, <p>As everyone wondered how it was possible? Julien turned his head to face the recording device.</p>, <p>His expression appeared for all those to see.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>A strange silence suddenly overtook the arena as everyone stopped speaking. As he looked, his eyes seemed to say,</p>, <p>'Are you seeing this...?'</p>, <p>Seeing this? Who was he talking to?</p>, <p>His face changed slightly. So did his eyes. All of a sudden, it appeared as though he was a completely different person.</p>, <p>Julien's eyes widened as he looked around him.</p>, <p>'They're watching you.'</p>, <p>Despite his strange behavior, the spectators couldn't take their eyes away from him. Again, his expression changed.</p>, <p>This time, he appeared different again.</p>, <p>A new persona.</p>, <p>'.....All of you.'</p>, <p>He didn't seem to be addressing the crowd.</p>, <p>But something else.</p>, <p>'Your existence...'</p>, <p>He was speaking to the four entities within him. There were ten, but he could only enter the mind of four.</p>, <p>Even so, Julien understood that despite their differences, they were the same.</p>, <p>He had seen it through the four he managed to enter.</p>, <p>Giel, Arian, Jacob, Clyde, Laura, Johanna, Karl, Rowan, Evan, and Leonard. These were the names of the young children.</p>, <p>The Charred Dragon Unit.</p>, <p>This was the tale of ten young people.</p>, <p>It was a sad tale.</p>, <p>A tale of ten people who the longer they existed, the less they felt like they existed. In the end, they all wanted the same thing.</p>, <p>To have someone out there acknowledge the fact that they existed.</p>, <p>And he put on this performance to let the world see them.</p>, <p>'The world sees it. I've shown them.'</p>, <p>Staring into the recording device, he returned to his usual expression. His eyes looked down at the mammoth, and his lips parted slightly.</p>, <p>\".....That you exist.\"</p>, <p>Existed.</p>, <p>Different, but the same.</p>, <p>Such was the name of their tale.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Sorry for the delay, very long chap.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>\"We're almost there.\"</p>, <p>Karl sprinted forward as his group followed him from behind. Turning his head, he stared at them and urged them to quicken their speed.</p>, <p>\".....One last push. We should be amongst the firsts.\"</p>, <p>Though he said that, he didn't believe that to be the case. They had wasted too much time trying to catch up with the leading teams.</p>, <p>'Monsters.'</p>, <p>That was all Karl could think of as he looked at the scores on his bracelet. From the start until now, the top two groups had maintained a steady lead.</p>, <p>It only had stopped recently.</p>, <p>Most likely, there were already people fighting against the boss monster.</p>, <p>'That's fine, they'll be exhausted by the time we arrive. We can steal their kill after all parties are exhausted.'</p>, <p>It was a feasible plan.</p>, <p>One that he planned on doing.</p>, <p>Or at least, originally planned to do.</p>, <p>\"W-what is this...?\"</p>, <p>Standing by the entrance of the main chamber, Karl looked around with an open mouth. The same was true for his team members who looked around with similar stunned expressions.</p>, <p>\"....Threads.\"</p>, <p>They covered the entire space.</p>, <p>Was the boss monster some sort of spider? Such were Karl's initial thoughts as he looked around and spotted a few familiar faces in the distance.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>From Johnathan and his team to Aoife, and her members. Wearing similar grim expressions, they were all looking towards a specific direction.</p>, <p>Towards a certain man.</p>, <p>When Karl turned his head to trace where their gazes were directed towards, his eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"....Ah.\"</p>, <p>Him...?</p>, <p>His appearance alone stood out from the rest. Karl was familiar with him. Having scanned him before the examination began, Karl didn't think too much of him.</p>, <p>\"Why is everyone-\"</p>, <p>And then he stopped.</p>, <p>He realized. A massive creature rested not far from where Julien was. No, rather... It looked lifeless.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, he recalled the expressions of the other groups.</p>, <p>Slowly, the pieces started to piece together in his mind and his expression yet again changed.</p>, <p>\"B-but how...?\"</p>, <p>Unable to believe it, he used his skill. He distinctively remembered Julien's aura to be average to above average.</p>, <p>How cou-</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Blink.</p>, <p> Blinking once, he made sure to check if he was seeing correctly.</p>, <p>He didn't, and as if the words were stuck in his mouth, Karl swallowed his saliva. A</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, he found it hard to breathe.</p>, <p>Despite Julien not meeting his gaze, it seemed as if invisible hands clenched tightly around his throat, suffocating him to the brink of breathlessness.</p>, <p>Staring at him.</p>, <p>Or more specifically the aura surrounding his body, he felt his throat grow dry.</p>, <p>\"....That.\"</p>, <p>The aura surrounding his body.</p>, <p>It was overwhelming.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Absorbing one's memories and emotions wasn't easy.</p>, <p>Not only did I have to deal with the aftermath of reliving their memories, but I also had to get rid of their lingering emotions.</p>, <p>Were I not to do that, then they'd remain stuck within me, making it harder for me to absorb.</p>, <p>It was for that reason that I had to do this.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>But it wasn't the only reason I did it.</p>, <p>Regaining control of myself, I looked down at the creature beneath me. It was lying motionless, on its last breath.</p>, <p>Even so, it was still not dead.</p>, <p>It had only been weakened due to my curse magic. And so, without thinking twice, I stared at its inky black eyes before clenching my fist.</p>, <p>Puchi!</p>, <p>Blood splattered all over me.</p>, <p>[+5000 Points]</p>, <p>Shortly after that, my bracelet buzzed and I heard a low chime.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Keeping my gaze focused on the mammoth, I gradually raised my head to stare at the recording device and the other cadets.</p>, <p>There was another reason that I needed an audience.</p>, <p>....I wanted the world to understand that I wasn't the Black Star for no reason.</p>, <p>I was at a point where I needed to appear stronger than I actually was. I was in a position where I couldn't hide my strength. I had to do the opposite.</p>, <p>And glancing around, I could tell I had done a very good job at that.</p>, <p>So....</p>, <p>Turning around, I looked at my group.</p>, <p>Besides Kiera who was looking at me with a frown, they were staring at me with open mouths.</p>, <p>\"Y-you...? Since when were you capable of making such a move?\"</p>, <p>I ignored Josephine's question and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>\"Let's go.\"</p>, <p>Passing them, I headed deep into the tunnel.</p>, <p>As I walked, I never looked back. It wasn't because I wanted to keep appearances up or anything of the sort.</p>, <p>....It was because my body was breaking down.</p>, <p>The side effects of the pill were starting to show. The pain was starting to become unbearable. I needed to get out of here.</p>, <p>Thankfully, I was sure that nobody would come after me.</p>, <p>I had made sure to put on a performance that deterred others from doing so.</p>, <p>And I was right.</p>, <p>[You have exited the Labyrinth; Team Julien and his sidekicks ]</p>, <p>[Your Team Score is — 5670]</p>, <p>[Rank 1]</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The surroundings were gray.</p>, <p>In the distance, a white sun hung in the air. Hands crawled up from the ground, reaching out for the four individuals within the world.</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>\"Damn it...!\"</p>, <p>\"I need a little help here!\"</p>, <p>The four attempted to resist, casting various spells and wielding their weapons to fend off the grasping hands reaching for them.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Ah, crap...!\"</p>, <p>It was a futile attempt.</p>, <p>Regardless of what they did, the hands would regenerate and keep coming back for them.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Not far from them, a figure stood.</p>, <p>In front of her were two other figures. Aziel, and another individual of similar strength to his. He went by the name 'Black' and was a Fiend-ranked member. A mindless soldier whose only purpose was to follow orders.</p>, <p>With their weapons drawn, they attacked her.</p>, <p>SHIIIING—!</p>, <p>But that was a futile attempt on their end. With a casual wave of her hand, the space before them folded and the direction of their attacks shifted away from her.</p>, <p>\"What...?!\"</p>, <p>Delilah remained expressionless.</p>, <p>'How long has it been....?'</p>, <p>She had lost count by now. At first, it was just one person. He was strong, but he wasn't something that Delilah couldn't handle.</p>, <p>However, at the exact moment she extracted her domain, five other figures appeared. They weren't as strong as Aziel, but they were still rather strong. But it wasn't their strength that bothered her. It was their utter disregard for their own life that made things difficult for her.</p>, <p>With their combined efforts, they were able to hold her at a stalemate.</p>, <p>\"Ha...\"</p>, <p>Seeing the look on Delilah's face, Aziel sneered.</p>, <p>\"It's been several hours now. By now, all the cadets should've died or suffered serious injuries.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"How unfortunate. In the end, all of this is because you weren't able to deal with us quickly. Watch what happens when the entire world sees their best cadets die at the hands of the boss.\"</p>, <p>Aziel spoke in a tone that was filled with self-assurance. As if the result was predetermined.</p>, <p>Throughout the entire exchange, he had been rather talkative. His mission was to stall for time. He wasn't here to defeat Delilah.</p>, <p>She was simply not someone he could beat.</p>, <p>Pointing his weapon at Delilah, a long spear, his body erupted with a powerful wave of mana. The result of his action caused the nearby hands to shatter as the spear in his hand started to glow brighter.</p>, <p>\".....Remember. When everything ends, you'll become the focal point of the world. And not in a good way.\"</p>, <p>Before long, the domain started to show signs of shaking as faint cracks appeared all over the world.</p>, <p>This was all due to the influence of Aziel's attack.</p>, <p>As a lower seat, he was powerful. He was the same rank as Delilah, Tier 9. Although he wasn't as strong as her, he wasn't a nobody.</p>, <p>He was sure that his attack would at least do something to her.</p>, <p>And then, taking one last look at Delilah, he thrust his spear forward.</p>, <p>\"Go and greet the cadets you care so much about.\"</p>, <p>SHIIIIING—</p>, <p>As if the thrust sucked the entire space around it, the surroundings spun alongside the spear.</p>, <p>It was a devastating scene.</p>, <p>One which was accompanied by a gentle whistle that echoed in the air. Wherever the spear went, everything would shatter.</p>, <p>Crack! Crack!</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>In response to the attack, Delilah remained motionless.</p>, <p>Her eyes, which had become completely black were fixed on the spear as its image was reflected in her eyes.</p>, <p>Just as the spear was a few inches away from her, it stopped.</p>, <p>\"Uh....?\"</p>, <p>Aziel looked at her stunned.</p>, <p>His muscles tensed as he tried to thrust it forward, but it was to no avail. The spear. It refused to budge.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Delilah looked back at him with an empty look. Almost as if it was devoid of any life.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>The world shrank.</p>, <p>Shlup—!</p>, <p>Color flooded back into the world as the blackness receded from Delilah's eyes, and she found herself standing in a familiar environment.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Silence gripped the surroundings as she stood still.</p>, <p>Extending her hand, a black pearl appeared in her grasp. Within it, several figures appeared. Delilah's attention focused on one specific one. He was looking at her with a horrified gaze.</p>, <p>Staring back, Delilah tilted her head slightly before pressing her two fingers together.</p>, <p>Cr Crack—</p>, <p>The pearl shattered in an instant.</p>, <p>Rubbing her fingers to get rid of the lingering shards of the pearl, Delilah turned around to face the entrance of the Labyrinth.</p>, <p>Bringing her foot up, she stomped the ground once.</p>, <p>A shattering sound akin to glass breaking echoed shortly after as an invisible film shattered under her step. Lowering her body, she opened the trapdoor that led to the Labyrinth. As she did, she extended her mana into the Labyrinth to see the current situation.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Her movements stopped when she did.</p>, <p>Blinking several times, she once again extended her mana around. Seeing that she got the same result as the first time, her eyes widened slightly.</p>, <p>\"....Nothing?\"</p>, <p>Delilah had originally expected to see a desperate situation upon entering the Labyrinth, but much to her surprise, everything was perfect.</p>, <p>Almost too perfect...</p>, <p>\"What happened?\"</p>, <p>To the point where she started to question whether something had truly happened or not.</p>, <p>Frowning, Delilah took out a small device from her pocket. It was a small cube the size of a small ball. Tapping on it, a small projection appeared.</p>, <p>A figure appeared the moment she turned on the projection.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>A figure she was all too familiar with.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>He appeared to have ranked first.</p>, <p>Lowering her head to stare at the entrance, she looked back at the projection. Or more specifically, the cadet who appeared in it.</p>, <p>'Was it you...?\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The moment Julien and his sidekicks came out of the Labyrinth, none of the spectators said a thing.</p>, <p>They just stood in silence to stare at them.</p>, <p>....Or more specifically Julien.</p>, <p>Yet again, he had pulled everyone's attention. He stole the show once more. What he had done, the public remembered.</p>, <p>It was that memorable.</p>, <p>In one of the corners of the arena stands. A man leaned on his seat while staring at Julien beneath.</p>, <p>He wore a brown top hat and brown coat.</p>, <p>\"....It was a nice performance.\"</p>, <p>It was hard to tell who he was addressing. There was no one besides him.</p>, <p>\"He's certainly a very powerful first year. But still, it's surprising how he had managed to singlehandedly defeat the monster just by himself.\"</p>, <p>The other cadets may have done a little by tiring it out, but at the end of the day, he was the one who had defeated the monster.</p>, <p>\"It's crazy.\"</p>, <p>Extending his hand, he removed his hat to reveal his dark hair and deep brown eyes. He was none other than the Inquisitor.</p>, <p>Pinching his chin, he leaned back slightly.</p>, <p>\"....It's almost as if he had taken something.\"</p>, <p>Just as he said those words, Julien, the main star of the show excused himself. The Inquisitor's eyes traced his back as he left.</p>, <p>\"Uahg.\"</p>, <p>Closing his eyes for a short moment, he put his hat back on and stretched.</p>, <p>\"....Looks like it's also time for me to go do my job.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Haaa....\"</p>, <p>I found it hard to breathe. Looking around, the world seemed to spin. I couldn't see straight and I had trouble walking.</p>, <p>Even so, I kept my expression firm and marched forward. I had long left the arena and my teammates.</p>, <p>They didn't stop me and let me go. They were probably surprised by my actions back in the chamber.</p>, <p>It was good that way.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>I didn't know where I was going.</p>, <p>I was just mindlessly wandering around the Academy campus.</p>, <p>'At this rate, I'll die.'</p>, <p>That much was becoming obvious to me. My chest burned, and my legs were starting to give up on me.</p>, <p>The excess mana that was lingering within my body was threatening to erupt at any second. I could already picture a scene where I'd explode into millions of pieces out of nowhere.</p>, <p>'....That's not good.'</p>, <p>As I walked, I could feel the gazes of the passerbies on me.</p>, <p>Some stopped to whisper to each other, while others stared at me from the distance. I looked at them briefly before continuing forward.</p>, <p>I was so out of it that I couldn't tell if they were looking at me because they had seen my performance, or that I looked extremely sickly.</p>, <p> '....Where do I go?'</p>, <p>To the infirmary?</p>, <p>Yeah, no.</p>, <p>If I were to do that, they would discover all about the drug that I had taken. The only reason that nobody suspected a thing was because before entering the Labyrinth, all cadets had been stripped and searched by the Academy inspectors.</p>, <p>The only thing that we were allowed to bring was the bracelets. The Academy provided the weapons.</p>, <p>The drug was something that nobody would think I'd be able to access.</p>, <p>For now, I was in the clear.</p>, <p>.....But I knew that I was still not out of the danger zone.</p>, <p>Were I to pass out here and sent to the infirmary, then it would instantly become clear that I had taken something. The Academy doctors weren't that naive.</p>, <p>'I can't allow for that to happen.'</p>, <p>It would destroy everything that I tried so hard to build.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Gradually, my steps stopped.</p>, <p>'Do I have no choice...?'</p>, <p>There was one place that I had in mind. A place that would resolve all my worries.</p>, <p>I clenched my fists and covered my mouth.</p>, <p>\"Cough...!\"</p>, <p>Coughing, I felt something spew out from my mouth.</p>, <p>Drip! Drip...!</p>, <p>I didn't need to look to understand what it was. Quickly wiping the blood away from my mouth, I closed my eyes and moved forward again.</p>, <p>This time, I had a direction.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Hmmm.\"</p>, <p>Inside Atlas's office — a vast office that overlooked the entire Academy from the top.</p>, <p>\"There have been twenty-seven reported deaths. All of them belong to cadets from lower-ranked Academies. We have yet to make the news public.\"</p>, <p>Listening to his assistant's voice, Atlas remained seated with an impassive expression. Carefully managing his expression, he closed his eyes for a brief moment as his assistant continued,</p>, <p>\"Thanks to Julien and his sidekicks's appearance towards the middle we were able to appease some of the protests regarding some of the cadet groups not appearing in the main projection screen.\"</p>, <p>It was a general briefing about the situation.</p>, <p>Every time the name 'Julien and his sidekicks' was mentioned, Atlas would find his brows twitching slightly. However, he was quick to grow used to it.</p>, <p>The mid-terms had yet to end. However, the winner had already been decided. With an overwhelming point difference, they were ranked first.</p>, <p>Given the amount of time that the other groups had left, it wasn't impossible for them to get close to them, but they were probably too exhausted to do so.</p>, <p>In the end, it was safe to assume that the team [Julien and his sidekicks] would end up placing first by the end of it all.</p>, <p>The problem now was something else.</p>, <p>\"How should we reveal the news to the Chancellors of the other Academies? Julien and his sidekicks' appearance calmed them down somewhat. In their minds they were probably thinking; If their recording device also stopped working and they appeared not long after, surely it suggested that it was nothing big.\"</p>, <p>The assistant paused.</p>, <p>\"But...\"</p>, <p>\"....We won't be able to keep them calm for much longer.\"</p>, <p>Atlas finished the words for his assistant.</p>, <p>\"Eventually, we'll have to tell them the truth about what happened.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Slowly opening his eyes to reveal his yellow pupils, he placed his hand over the wooden desk opposite him and drummed his fingers lightly.</p>, <p>\"Tell them to come visit me.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>\"I will tell them the news personally.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>His assistant showed a look of surprise. However, quickly recomposing, she nodded her head in understanding.</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>\"....You may leave.\"</p>, <p>\"I will bring them back as you've ordered.\"</p>, <p>With a gentle blow, she left the room, leaving Atlas alone in his office. As she left, he remained seated in his chair.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>The room plunged into a state of silence.In the silence, Atlas lowered his head to stare at his drawer. He stared at it for a good minute before opening it and pulling out a pair of black gloves, slipping them onto his hands.</p>, <p>It was a sort of ritual that he had. For whenever he had to do something important.</p>, <p>He had just put them on when the door knocked.</p>, <p>To Tok—</p>, <p>\"....That's rather fast.\"</p>, <p>Surprised, he opened his mouth to say,</p>, <p>\"Come in.\"</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>The door opened, but the people he had expected to come didn't appear. Instead, a young man with jet-black hair and hazel eyes entered.</p>, <p>Little needed to be said regarding his appearance; from the moment he arrived, he stood out distinctly. Yet, what truly stood out about him at the moment wasn't his appearance, but the mana coming out of his body.</p>, <p>It was rather intense.</p>, <p>\"....Hm?\"</p>, <p>Atlas's head tilted slightly at the appearance of the youth.</p>, <p>Phecda.</p>, <p>He hadn't expected him to be here.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>As Phecda opened the door and closed it behind him, he looked around the room for a brief moment before sitting down on the sofa opposite him.</p>, <p>He made himself comfortable before looking at Atlas. That was when Atlas noticed.</p>, <p>His gaze.</p>, <p>The way he looked at him.</p>, <p>It was one of indifference. A stark contrast from the first time they had met. Back then, while his gaze was somewhat similar, he could feel the apprehension within him.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>....That apprehension was completely gone at this moment.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The two stared at each other for a brief moment as the room stilled in the silence.</p>, <p>Then, breaking the silence was Julien who covered his mouth with his hand.</p>, <p>\"Oh...?\"</p>, <p>Drip. Drip...!</p>, <p>A red liquid seeped out from the narrow gap of his fingers.</p>, <p>Even then, he never took his gaze away from Atlas. Rather, his gaze intensified. It was as if he was telling him to keep looking.</p>, <p>\".....I've done it.\"</p>, <p>His voice came out hoarse.</p>, <p>Despite that, his voice was clear enough for Atlas to understand.</p>, <p>\"I've done my part.\"</p>, <p>Atlas nodded his head in acknowledgment.</p>, <p>\"I saw.\"</p>, <p>How could he not have seen? He had stolen the show. There wasn't anyone that hadn't seen his performance.</p>, <p>Most likely, everyone was still talking about it.</p>, <p>So...</p>, <p>Why would the star of the show come all the way to his office? Clearly, he had a motive in mind.</p>, <p>\".....Are you here to apologize for what you've done?\"</p>, <p>It would make sense if he did.</p>, <p>They had indeed spent a lot of resources trying to get this plan to work. However, it had all come crashing down because of the young cadet in front of him.</p>, <p>\"It wasn't easy to raise such a talented group.\"</p>, <p>Phecda's expression twitched slightly at the mention of the group. However, he was quick to recover as he shook his head.</p>, <p>\"No...?\"</p>, <p>Atlas thought the reason was that, but unexpectedly, Phecda shook his head.</p>, <p>\"Then?\"</p>, <p>Atlas wasn't offended by that. Rather, he had somewhat encouraged him to do what he did. For that, he didn't care at all for the apology.</p>, <p>He was just curious about his answer.</p>, <p>One that came shortly after.</p>, <p>\"No. I couldn't care less about what you... think.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Drip. Drip...!</p>, <p>As the blood continued to drip down from the gaps of his fingers, Phecda's lips suddenly started to close.</p>, <p>\"I only want one thing…\"</p>, <p>As they did, he managed to utter a few last words.</p>, <p>\"Fucking... heal me.\"</p>, <p>His arm limped down shortly after and blood started to spill from all his orifices. Despite that, he maintained his gaze fixed on Atlas.</p>, <p>\"He's out.\"</p>, <p>Even as his eyes remained open, Atlas could tell he had passed out.</p>, <p>It was quite a sight to see.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>The blood trickled down on the ground in a rhythmical manner.</p>, <p>Almost like the arm of a clock.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>It shattered whatever silence was about to take over.</p>, <p>Amidst all that, Atlas's mumblings overtook the repetitive sound of Phecda's blood dripping.</p>, <p>\"I couldn't care less about what you think...? Fucking heal me?\"</p>, <p>....It wasn't that Phecda's words had offended him. Rather, he couldn't care less about what he had said. It was more the tone in which he said those words.</p>, <p>How could he describe it...?</p>, <p>'It's as if he is certain I'll help him.'</p>, <p>Yes, it was that.</p>, <p>.....It was a thought that made him want to laugh. Especially since he was right. Phecda was invaluable to them. His performance had not only solidified his spot as the Haven's top ranker but at the same time, helped Delilah out of a sticky situation.</p>, <p>Would that lead to her trusting him more?</p>, <p>Atlas wasn't sure. However, his action must've definitely made her confused.</p>, <p>Whose side was he on? Hers or theirs...?</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>The thought made Atlas laugh.</p>, <p>Lowering his head, he took a good look at Phecda.</p>, <p>'The difference between a potential Fiend and Low Seat isn't their strength but their ability to think for themselves.'</p>, <p>Phecda was evaluated to be a potential Fiend.</p>, <p>Looking at his state, and how he had gone to the extent of consuming the drug that was meant for the boss monster, Atlas could see why he was evaluated as such.</p>, <p>But at the same time, he could also see something else.</p>, <p>Something more calculated...</p>, <p>Again, Atlas laughed.</p>, <p>\"....Interesting.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The Evenus Household was unusually quiet. With servants running all over the place to hold ceremonies for nearby noble houses, the estate was usually busy.</p>, <p>Today, however, things were different.</p>, <p>In a highly decorated room within the estate. A man stood with his arms crossed while staring at the projection in front of him.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>He stood in silence as he watched the scene in front of him replay over and over again.</p>, <p>Whenever the scene would end, he would bring his hand forward and shift the video back so he could watch it again.</p>, <p>It was a broadcast that had swept the entire Empire. Originally, Aldric wasn't interested. There were many things that he needed to take care of.</p>, <p>However, curiosity still got the better of him and he ended up getting a subscription for the event.</p>, <p>Aldric was curious about something.</p>, <p>His son, Julien.</p>, <p>Had he really changed as the reports suggested?</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>In the end, he ended up witnessing something that he hadn't expected to see.</p>, <p>\"....Was he hiding his abilities?\"</p>, <p>He watched as his son, Julien, completely took over the entire event with his abilities. The two of them had a slight resemblance with each other, but staring at the figure in the middle of the projection, Aldric didn't feel any of those familiarities he once used to feel.</p>, <p>Rather, he looked foreign to him.</p>, <p>Was this really his son?</p>, <p>\"Father.\"</p>, <p>A figure appeared beside Aldric. It was Linus. His second child. He too was staring at the projection with a frown.</p>, <p>\"That's Julien, isn't it?\"</p>, <p>\".....Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Has he always been this capable?\"</p>, <p>\"...No.\"</p>, <p>\"Do you think it's possible that he improved so much after joining Haven? No, even then, he is the Black Star. He's been outstanding ever since his entrance, hasn't he?\"</p>, <p>\"He has...\"</p>, <p>Aldric turned his head to stare at his second son.</p>, <p>Where was he getting with this?</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Without saying anything, Linus turned his head and their gazes met. Just slightly, Aldric noticed something peculiar in his second's son expression.</p>, <p>However, he couldn't quite tell what it was.</p>, <p>\"Do you think he's been hiding something from us? No matter how you look at it, that seems to be the case.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>At his words, Aldric remained silent.</p>, <p>He couldn't deny his son's words. There was certainly something about Julien that didn't make sense.</p>, <p>\"He must've had his reasons.\"</p>, <p> \"Which are?\"</p>, <p>\".....I don't know.\"</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>Linus scoffed slightly. He found the situation ridiculous. Aldric on the other hand, remained silent while looking back at the projection.</p>, <p>\"You don't have to worry about it too much.\"</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>Aldric didn't respond immediately.</p>, <p>Rather, he swiped his hand and replayed the video again. This time, he didn't focus his attention on Julien but a figure at the back.</p>, <p>With dull gray eyes, he stood motionless as Julien took the spotlight.</p>, <p>Raising his hand, he pointed it towards the projection.</p>, <p>\"....Because of him.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"So they've all died...?\"</p>, <p>In a quiet room outside of his office, Atlas leaned against the wall as he talked to the air.</p>, <p>\"....Not even one survivor?\"</p>, <p>—No.</p>, <p>A soft voice replied to his left.</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>Atlas closed his eyes to absorb the information. One lower seat and several Fiend ranks had been sent to delay Delilah. The goal had been to delay her for as long as possible, which should've been possible given the strength of the group.</p>, <p>However, things took an unexpected turn.</p>, <p>\"How did she do it?\"</p>, <p>It had to be noted that the ones sent weren't just random people that the organization had sent. They were extremely powerful people.</p>, <p>Their loss was a pretty severe blow to them.</p>, <p>—I am not entirely sure. However, from what I was able to gather, she used a domain.</p>, <p>\"A domain?\"</p>, <p>Atlas frowned. A domain was something that anyone who reached Tier 5 would be able to create. It was usually something that most individuals would keep a secret since it was a sort of trump card.</p>, <p>That being said...</p>, <p>\"...Have you gotten any information on what her domain does? I'm still struggling to comprehend the situation.\"</p>, <p>The fact that so many strong people had died was a big deal. Especially when it only took her four to five hours to do so.</p>, <p>Was her domain really that powerful?</p>, <p>—From what I'm gathering through the memory fragments of those who died, her domain is an entirely different world that absorbs the energy of anyone who is inside. I believe she's capable of absorbing their energy and making it into her own.</p>, <p>\"Is that so...?\"</p>, <p>—So far, yes. We're still looking into it.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Atlas frowned with a grim look.</p>, <p>Although it was still not fully clear, if her power was really like that, then something became clear to him.</p>, <p>\"It seems like we need to re-evaluate her strength.\"</p>, <p>Not only that, but...</p>, <p>\"If she's capable of absorbing their energy and making it her own, then she's also a lot more dangerous than we initially believed.\"</p>, <p>—I agree.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Atlas's frown deepened. The situation was a lot more serious than he had anticipated. He was just about to say something else when his brow lifted and he turned to look away.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>He suddenly felt a movement coming from his office and a smile finally appeared on his lips.</p>, <p>\"It seems like someone is about to wake up.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>I wasn't sure for how long I was out for. All I could remember was seeing the world turn bright before darkness engulfed my consciousness.</p>, <p>It was all a fog from there.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>When I regained consciousness, I found that I was lying on the cold hard ground.</p>, <p>It felt rather uncomfortable.</p>, <p>\"Ugh.\"</p>, <p>Groaning, I rubbed my head. It was throbbing in pain, and the light coming from the top was stinging my eyes.</p>, <p>My eyes squinted as I used my arm to cover my eyes.</p>, <p>\"Where am I...?\"</p>, <p>I was confused at first, but as I looked around, I realized exactly where I was.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>And then I remembered exactly what had happened. For a brief moment, my body tensed. Where is he? Did he figure something out...? As I looked around tensely, I was relieved to see that I was the only one in the room.</p>, <p>At the same time, the fact that I was still alive proved that everything went well.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes to feel my body.</p>, <p>'It's a mess.'</p>, <p>The mana flow in some places was slower than others, and my core had shrunk slightly. However, besides all of that, it was safe to say that I was out of danger.</p>, <p>No, rather...</p>, <p>'I think I've gotten stronger.'</p>, <p>I wasn't very conscious back then, but the moment that I defeated the mammoth, I remembered seeing a notification.</p>, <p>The notification was accompanied by something else.</p>, <p>But I hadn't been able to tell exactly what it was. Thankfully, I could check.</p>, <p>∎ EXP + 67%</p>, <p>As expected.</p>, <p>It was a notification indicating my increase in experience for having defeated the mammoth.</p>, <p>I hadn't felt anything back then because of my circumstances, but now that I was out of danger, I could tell that I had gotten stronger.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Lowering my head, I squeezed my hand. My grip was rather weak and my reaction was slower than my brain input.</p>, <p>\"Doesn't feel like I've gotten stronger at all...\"</p>, <p>Rather, it felt as if I had become disabled. Of course, I knew it was merely because I was still not in full health.</p>, <p>'Still, this is quite a lot of experience.'</p>, <p>But it made sense considering the strength of the creature which was around Tier 4 to High Tier 3.</p>, <p>But if that wasn't all...</p>, <p>[Midterms: You have overcome the event.]</p>, <p>A new notification flashed in my vision.</p>, <p>It was accompanied by another.</p>, <p>[You were able to prevent a tragedy from occurring in the midterms. Besides a few casualties, the midterms have proceeded smoothly.]</p>, <p>■ Game Progression EXP + 11%</p>, <p>Game Progression : [0%[18%]100%]</p>, <p>\"Aahhh...\"</p>, <p>A familiar sensation washed over me. It was one that I thought I was starting to get used to, but unlike the previous times, I could feel the energy coming into my body was far more thick and pure than the previous ones.</p>, <p>My mana core started to expand rapidly and I felt my body surge with strength.</p>, <p>The bar continued to rise before my very eyes. It continued like this until it eventually stopped at Level 25.</p>, <p>■ Character Progression EXP + 207%</p>, <p>Exp : [0%—[23%]100%]</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>An unbelievable amount of progress. One that was supposed to take me months to achieve.</p>, <p>....And yet, I had managed to achieve it all in one single event.</p>, <p>'I'm starting to catch up with the top cadets.'</p>, <p>While I wasn't exactly sure about how strong they currently were, accounting for their rate of progress and the manuals they had, most of the top cadets were Tier 3 and above.</p>, <p>....And unlike them, I wasn't as talented. If not for the quest, I would've probably still been stuck at Level 20. Perhaps, not even in Tier 2.</p>, <p>It was the painful reality of my situation.</p>, <p>But I wasn't disheartened. Talent or no talent, I was going to work to the point where I became the best version of what I could ever be.</p>, <p>'That much I have to do.'</p>, <p>[Calamity Progress]</p>, <p>Aoife K.

One that I easily dismissed as I struggled to help myself up.</p>, <p>'How long have I been out for?'</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>It was at that moment that I spotted a figure sitting down on the couch on the opposite end, and I froze.</p>, <p>He was staring at me with an interested look.</p>, <p>'When did he get here...?!'</p>, <p>I was so sure that I had been the only person in the room just a few moments ago.</p>, <p>How was he here?</p>, <p>\"The more I look at you, the more interesting you become in my eyes.\"</p>, <p>His gentle and clear voice echoed within the room. As his golden pupils stared at me, he cocked his head slightly.</p>, <p>\"I was just outside when I noticed something irregular coming from your body. I thought something had gone wrong and came to check on you, but...\"</p>, <p>He lowered his head to scan my body up and down.</p>, <p>\"Do you know how surprised I was to see your strength suddenly jump up out of nowhere?\"</p>, <p>Atlas appeared just before me.</p>, <p>Before I even had the chance to say anything, he went on to grasp my hand.</p>, <p>I wanted to take it back, but as if I had lost all energy from my body, I found myself unable to resist.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stared at him with bated breath.</p>, <p>I could practically feel the beat of my heart drum loudly inside of my mind. Anxiety was starting to creep within me. Did he find something out? Is he...</p>, <p>He eventually let go of my wrist before muttering,</p>, <p>\"....So interesting.\"</p>, <p>Interesting?</p>, <p>What did he find out?</p>, <p>\"You have an interesting constitution.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>\"While your injuries are still present, you were able to absorb some of the medical properties of the pill. It's because of that reason that you were able to become stronger. From what I can tell, you're halfway into becoming Tier 3. That's a considerable jump. Not bad.\"</p>, <p>The fuck is this guy...</p>, <p>'Ah.'</p>, <p>Then I understood.</p>, <p>'....He's misunderstanding the reason for why my strength increased.'</p>, <p>He didn't find anything about the 'quest' or the fact that there was anything wrong with me. That I wasn't the real Julien.</p>, <p>I took the opportunity to roll with the misunderstanding.</p>, <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>, <p>\"Hmm, there's no need to thank me for something you were born with. You can however thank me for saving you.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I remained quiet at that.</p>, <p>\"Oh?\"</p>, <p>His brow raised as he turned to look at me.</p>, <p>\"Not even a word of thanks? It seems like you're taking my abilities for granted.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I again said nothing.</p>, <p>However, as if understanding what I meant, he leaned back on his chair.</p>, <p>\"You were lucky.\"</p>, <p>Raising his hand, he pulled his black glove down while clenching his hand at the same time.</p>, <p>\"Orphion isn't a drug that is designed for human consumption. It was originally designed for the boss monster in the labyrinth. The fact that you were able to withstand so much energy is itself a miracle.\"</p>, <p>Closing his hand into a fist, the leather glove squeaked slightly as he turned his attention back to me.</p>, <p>\"....The only reason you were able to survive is because of me. Besides Delilah, there aren't many people that are capable of taking out that much energy from you. But I bet you knew that.\"</p>, <p>He suddenly smiled.</p>, <p>\"Is that why you took the drug?\"</p>, <p>\"....Yes.\"</p>, <p>I nodded then.</p>, <p>I wasn't carrying on with the misunderstanding this time.</p>, <p>It was the truth.</p>, <p>The reason why I took the drug while knowing the consequences that would come from taking it was because I was certain he would heal me.</p>, <p>I knew my worth.</p>, <p>.....And so, I used it.</p>, <p>Them.</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>With a soft laugh, Atlas covered his mouth with his curled index finger. He seemed to be trying to hide his smile.</p>, <p>I just sat there in silence and waited for him to say something.</p>, <p>Eventually, he did.</p>, <p>....And his next words stunned me.</p>, <p>\"It seems like we need to consider upgrading your potential within the organization.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Clank—</p>, <p>I was still in a daze as I came out of the office and walked past the corridor that led toward the exit of the building.</p>, <p>As I walked, I could hear the rhythmical echo of my steps.</p>, <p>They were soft, and yet, they powerfully rang within my mind.</p>, <p>'....Upgrade my potential?'</p>, <p>It wasn't as though I didn't understand what he was trying to imply.</p>, <p>After going through the memories of the few members of the Dragon Charred Unit, I was able to get a better idea of how things worked within the organization.</p>, <p>It was unfortunate that they had never been in the main headquarters. Otherwise, I would've been able to go myself.</p>, <p>There seemed to be a special requirement for one to be able to enter the main headquarters.</p>, <p>Or maybe there wasn't? It could just be that the group was too unimportant for the organization to have them enter the main headquarters.</p>, <p>It was a bit of a pity considering that I wanted to see how it looked.</p>, <p>Still...</p>, <p>I thought back to Atlas's words.</p>, <p>\"Crazy \"</p>, <p>It was because I knew what his words meant that I thought the entire situation was crazy.</p>, <p>'What rank even am I...?'</p>, <p>Nothing within the memories of the four members of the Dragon Charred Unit told me anything about what the previous Julien's potential rank was. Was he planning on upgrading my potential to 'Fiend' rank?</p>, <p>There was still so much that I didn't know.</p>, <p>\".....I'll need to figure things out better.\"</p>, <p>\"What do you need to figure out?\"</p>, <p>A soft voice reached me from the front and I stopped. Looking up, my brows jumped up slightly.</p>, <p>\"Chancellor?\"</p>, <p>Delilah.</p>, <p>She was standing before me. What was she doing here...? No, that was a stupid question. She most likely had some important business to attend to. This was after all where Atlas and a few other important figures's offices were.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>As expected, Delilah didn't answer me and just stared at me.</p>, <p>She didn't need to say a thing for me to understand what her gaze meant.</p>, <p>'What are you doing here?'</p>, <p>I pursed my lips for a brief moment before answering,</p>, <p>\"I was called here by the Vice-Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>\"Atlas?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>For a brief moment, her eyes turned inky as they stared straight into me. In that short moment, it felt as though I was being sucked right into her eyes.</p>, <p>An unknown and desolate world flashed in my vision briefly before her figure reappeared before me.</p>, <p> \"What did you do?\"</p>, <p>\".....I answered his questions.\"</p>, <p>I answered shortly after as I took a moment to adjust my mind.</p>, <p>It wasn't a lie. I was really answering his questions.</p>, <p>\"He was interrogating me regarding the incident that took place in the Labyrinth.\"</p>, <p>\"....And?\"</p>, <p>\"I am done. I was just about to go back to the dorms.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Yet again, Delilah didn't say a thing. She simply stared at me for a good moment before resuming her steps.</p>, <p>As she passed me, she glanced at me before mumbling,</p>, <p>\"Get some rest.\"</p>, <p>Tak. Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>The sound of her heels clicking against the corridor's pavement echoed in the air. I stood still for a moment and stared at her departing back.</p>, <p>For some reason...</p>, <p>....Her back looked extremely tired.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>That night, Aoife and Evelyn were just coming back from the arena grounds. Overall, their group managed to rank second. It was a fairly good result. However, neither of the girls spoke while walking back to the dorms.</p>, <p>They both seemed to be immersed in their own thoughts.</p>, <p>\".....It's strange.\"</p>, <p>Perhaps not realizing it, Evelyn let her true thoughts out. Aoife's steps paused and she turned to look at her</p>, <p>\"What is?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn looked around stunned and her steps similarly paused. Then, as if realizing what she had done, she covered her mouth.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Aoife stared at her for a brief moment. She could more or tell what she was thinking about.</p>, <p>\"Is it about Julien?\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>As expected. Evelyn's reaction told her all that she needed to know. And it was her reaction that made her curious.</p>, <p>\"What do you mean by strange?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, no, it's...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn fumbled over her words. However, under Aoife's intense gaze, her face scrunched up and she eventually relented and shared her true thoughts.</p>, <p>\"Julien. He's strange.\"</p>, <p>\"As in?\"</p>, <p>\"He... He wasn't that strong before.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"Like, he was okay. He was supposed to be okay. Every time I see him, he changes. I don't know how to explain it.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn tried to find the right words to articulate herself. However, in the end, she could only look at Aoife with a helpless smile.</p>, <p>It seemed a little sad too.</p>, <p>\"....I just don't think he's the Julien that I know. Whenever I see him, I see someone completely different. Even when he changed I could tell slightly it was him, but now?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn shook her head and scoffed slightly.</p>, <p>\"Ha. I don't know. I really don't know.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Noticing Evelyn's expression, Aoife didn't pursue the matter further. Rather, her words echoed deep within her mind. 'Someone completely different? Every time I see him, he changes...?'</p>, <p>Evelyn's words lingered in her mind, nagging at her even after they parted ways and she returned to the room.</p>, <p>Laying down on her bed, Aoife blankly stared at the ceiling.</p>, <p>\"Changes...\"</p>, <p>Muttering to herself, she closed her eyes. In the darkness that suddenly overtook her vision, a figure appeared.</p>, <p>He stood in the middle of a large chamber, his appearance seeming to eclipse that of everyone around him with his cold expression. Threads covered the entire space, with a gigantic creature standing not far from where he was.</p>, <p>It was the same scene from The Labyrinth.</p>, <p>Even now, it had been deeply imprinted in her mind, making it impossible for her to forget.</p>, <p>How could she forget?</p>, <p>Aoife doubted anyone could forget that moment.</p>, <p>'Someone completely different? Every time I see him, he changes.'</p>, <p>Yet again, Evelyn's words rang in her mind. They echoed over and over and over again. Almost like the buzz of a mosquito. One that she couldn't kill regardless of what she did. Eventually, opening her eyes to reveal her golden pupils, Aoife sat up.</p>, <p>Looking around, she reached out for her communication device.</p>, <p>\"Ehwew.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, Aoife fiddled with the communication device in her hands.</p>, <p>She didn't really know why she was doing this, but it was starting to become impossible for her to sleep.</p>, <p>Therefore, pressing on the communication device, she started to speak.</p>, <p>\"Hey, uncle~\"</p>, <p>As she spoke, her voice came out rather coy. Were anyone to see her like this, they'd be stunned out of their minds.</p>, <p>But her uncle was an exception.</p>, <p>Besides her brother, he was the only person she respected.</p>, <p>\"....Is it possible for you to check something for me?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The next day.</p>, <p>News of the incident had been kept hushed by the Academy. For some reason, the Academies involved didn't utter a single thing about the missing cadets. In the end, the situation seemed to have been resolved by the higher-ups.</p>, <p>The details of how they had done it were not something that I was keenly aware of. However, I could more or less imagine what had happened.</p>, <p>'He's probably done something to them.'</p>, <p>Atlas.</p>, <p>Not only was he powerful. He was also a member of the royal family. If he wanted to keep a situation quiet, then he had the capabilities and resources to do so.</p>, <p>It was scary when one thought about it.</p>, <p>That being said, I didn't really understand why he had decided to cover up the matter when his goal had been to make this situation as big as possible. Did he think it was going to be a waste of time?</p>, <p>Perhaps.</p>, <p>\"It's unfortunate that the collaboration with the other Academies has to be halted here. I'm not sure about what happened, but from what I've heard, the individual performance will be paused.\"</p>, <p>Currently, I was sitting in the lecture room. Everyone was present. From time to time, I would get an occasional glance, but I ignored it and kept my attention focused on Professor Bridgette.</p>, <p>She was currently detailing us on the situation.</p>, <p>\"....I know that you are all disappointed by this. I am too.\"</p>, <p>As she said this, I looked around. Eventually, my gaze fell on Kiera. She was wearing the biggest smile I had ever seen her wear in a long time. She almost seemed to be gloating. No, rather, she was gloating.</p>, <p>I could more or less tell why she was like that.</p>, <p>'She hates studying.'</p>, <p>It became obvious to me from the moment we became team members. Even though we weren't meant to be a study group, there were times in between breaks that we took as a chance to study.</p>, <p>Kiera was the only one that refused to do any of that. I could still picture the look of scorn she gave us back then.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>No, I didn't have to picture it.</p>, <p>Turning my head, I could see Kiera looking at me with that same expression of the past. It was as if she was telling me, 'See? You should've listened to me and just rested.'</p>, <p>That gaze was followed by a subtle laugh.</p>, <p>\"On the bright side, however, I have great news for all of you!\"</p>, <p>The Professor's bright words attracted my attention yet again. The same was true for the other cadets who all turned to look at her.</p>, <p>\"We will be going on a trip!\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I blinked my eyes as the classroom fell silent. Everyone was having a hard time understanding what was going on.</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette went on to explain,</p>, <p>\"After all that hard work, it's about time we all relax, no? While this excursion won't exactly be a vacation, we will allow you all to take some time to visit the place that we're visiting. It's a nice change of pace after all the time you've spent at the Academy.\"</p>, <p>The sudden news took everyone by surprise. However, shortly after many of the cadets waved their fists in the air in celebration.</p>, <p>I couldn't blame them. I too felt the same way.</p>, <p>....Well, maybe?</p>, <p>Was there ever a thing like a break for me?</p>, <p>'I hope I don't get a quest.'</p>, <p>Although I hated to say it, I needed a break. Not only because of the injuries in my body which had yet to heal, but also because I needed time to adjust my mental state.</p>, <p>Though I was able to keep myself from showing it on the outside, I was starting to pick up certain habits that weren't mine.</p>, <p>Like...</p>, <p>Scratch. Scratch.</p>, <p>'Damn itchy.'</p>, <p>The more time passed the more obvious it was becoming to me that the other personalities that I had tried to integrate with me were starting to take over if even slightly.</p>, <p>I needed time to focus on myself and separate my real self from the other personalities that were within my body.</p>, <p>That being said, I knew that I had to discard a few.</p>, <p>It was impossible for me to keep my sanity with the amount that I had. That was simply too much of a burden for my mind.</p>, <p>I needed to let go of a few.</p>, <p>'I'll find some time to do that later.'</p>, <p>Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Professor Bridgette clapped her hands. Clap. Clap—! In doing so, the classroom once again quieted down.</p>, <p>Sporting her trademark smile, the professor looked at us before taking out a sheet of paper from behind the podium.</p>, <p>\"That being said. Just because the individual examinations have been postponed, that doesn't mean the written ones have. Please take out your equipment. The test will be-\"</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>A loud banging sound echoed from the distance before the Professor could even get her words out.</p>, <p>It was followed by a high-pitched curse.</p>, <p>\"Fuck!!\"</p>, <p>This time, turning my head, it was my turn to laugh.</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Scritch-scratch</p>, <p>The sound of scribbling pencils rang out in the classroom. In the otherwise quiet classroom, the cadets were focused on the papers in front of them.</p>, <p>Some were scratching their heads in confusion, while others were fully focused on the paper.</p>, <p>I was too as I filled in the questions in front of me.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>Flipping the page over, my eyes paused on the next question.</p>, <p>[Describe the weakness of this monster]</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I paused for a second and frowned. Not because the question was hard, but because it was a little too easy.</p>, <p>'Isn't this the boss monster of the Labyrinth?'</p>, <p>&lt;&lt;Glacial Behemoth&gt;&gt;</p>, <p>Staring at the image in front of me, I didn't know what to say. Was this on purpose? In the end, I answered with the only answer that I knew.</p>, <p>'The tusk.'</p>, <p>That was the monster's weakness. I had killed it using a different method, but that was the answer. If one would look back on the replay of the event, they'd notice that the tusk was the only area the cadets were targeting.</p>, <p>This was the reason.</p>, <p>'....This is going well.'</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>Flipping over to the next page, I went on to answer the next few questions.</p>, <p>There were no more freebies like the mammoth question, but they were all something that I was able to answer. In the end, all that studying I paid off.</p>, <p>Before I knew it, time had passed and it was the end of the test. Marking the end of the examination was the Professor's voice.</p>, <p>\"That's it for the examination. Please hand over what you have written.\"</p>, <p>Several groans later, the papers were all placed over the podium where the Professor was.</p>, <p>\"....I'm done. I'm done.\"</p>, <p>Along the way, a listless Kiera handed over her paper.</p>, <p>This was probably hell for her.</p>, <p>\"Wow perfect! I will be grading this over the next few days. Hopefully, all of you have done well.\"</p>, <p>Cheerfully stacking the papers together, she went on to speak about the trip.</p>, <p>\"Going back on the news of the trip. We will be departing next week so all of you pack the necessary equipment and things before we leave. We will be there for about a week, or maybe more. It will depend on how long it will take for us to clear the problem.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette went on to explain a few more details regarding the trip.</p>, <p>The location of the trip was 'Ellnor'.</p>, <p>It was a small town located on the outskirts of the Empire's border with the Aetheria Empire. There were no notable conflicts between the two Empires. In fact, they could somewhat be considered to be on even terms.</p>, <p>Standing at its center, the Nurs Ancifa Empire was surrounded by all three Empires.</p>, <p>Because it was the strongest, it was usually viewed as a dangerous entity. It was for that reason that the Empire tried to maintain a form of 'relationship' with the Aetheria Empire.</p>, <p>Ellnor was located near the border. Right next to a large ridge that separated the two Empires.</p>, <p>Currently, there was a little problem in Ellnor.</p>, <p> The Professor had yet to disclose what the problem was. However, given that we had been sent, it wasn't anything that we shouldn't be able to handle.</p>, <p>'.....Yeah, bullshit.'</p>, <p>I could just tell that a problem was going to come up.</p>, <p>Call it instincts.</p>, <p>\"In any case. Please make sure that you are all ready for the upcoming trip. Oh, and before I forget. Make sure you study for the second part of the examination which will be held a day before the trip.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette left shortly after that.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I sat in silence while the entire classroom stared at the door with blank looks. The silence was shortly shattered by Kiera who slumped down on her chair with a lost look.</p>, <p>\".....Second part? This was only the first part?\"</p>, <p>She went on to let out a hollow laugh.</p>, <p>\"It's me. I'm the problem.\"</p>, <p>\"At least you know.\"</p>, <p>Next to her, Josephine laughed. Kiera turned her head to glare at her, but it wasn't anything intimidating.</p>, <p>\"Next time. When you see us studying, how about you study?\"</p>, <p>\"Ha... Shit.\"</p>, <p>I packed my stuff while I shifted my attention away from them.</p>, <p>As I packed up my stuff, a shadow cast over the area that I was in. Surprised, I looked up to see Kiera standing in front of me. When did she get here?</p>, <p>Her face was currently twisted. Almost as if she was constipated.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>I frowned.</p>, <p>She wasn't here to fight me for laughing at her, right?</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>With a hoarse voice, Kiera fiddled with her fingers. It really did seem like she was struggling to speak.</p>, <p>I waited for a good couple of seconds for her to speak.</p>, <p>However, seeing that she was still not saying anything, I took my stuff with me and stood up. Only then did she react as she grabbed onto the sleeve of my shirt.</p>, <p>\"Wait.\"</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"That...\"</p>, <p>Kiera looked away.</p>, <p>I frowned again. What's up with her?</p>, <p>Her next words came out in a whisper, but I was still able to understand them. It was because I understood them that I had a hard time comprehending the situation.</p>, <p>\"S...study... Help me.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>So much that all I could do was stare at her with wide eyes.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"Why are you looking at me like that?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, fuck. Whatever. Fuck it. Treat it as if I didn't as—\"</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>Kiera stopped to look at me. She roughly tied up her platinum hair behind her while letting go of my sleeve.</p>, <p>\".....I don't have anyone else to ask.\"</p>, <p>I blinked.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"You heard me already.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I once again fell into silence. Eventually, my eyes fell on Josephine in the distance, but just as I was about to suggest her, Kiera cut me off.</p>, <p>\"That idiot is dumber than me. And I can't stand her.\"</p>, <p>But you can stand me...?</p>, <p>\"I'm busy.\"</p>, <p>In the end, I still rejected her.</p>, <p>\"Busy with what? You also have no friends.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I had no words to say to that. I wanted to refute her words, but as I opened my mouth to do it, I found myself at a complete loss for words.</p>, <p>\"See? You have no friends.\"</p>, <p>\".....And you?\"</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>It was her turn to be at a loss for words. In the end, she changed the conversation again.</p>, <p>\"Whatever fuck. Just teach me.\"</p>, <p>\"What do I get in all of this...?\"</p>, <p>The next set of exams was in a week. Taking into account that my body was injured and I couldn't train, I could help her study.</p>, <p>But it needed to be worth my time.</p>, <p>\".....I'll let you hold my hand?\"</p>, <p>Moving to the side, I prepared to leave when she pulled at my sleeve again.</p>, <p>\"No, wait...!\"</p>, <p>I stopped and looked back at her again. Her face twitched, and in the end, she mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Money? Is that okay with y-\"</p>, <p>\"Meet me at six every morning at the dorm's study area. I'll help you out then. My fee is 100 Rend per hour. Don't be late. I will charge every minute that you're late.\"</p>, <p>I left after saying my terms.</p>, <p>Kiera stood stunned for several seconds before she screamed from behind.</p>, <p>\"Wait, hold on! This is a fucking robbery! Hey...!\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>—There's nothing strange about him.</p>, <p>A familiar voice echoed from the communication device in Aoife's hands.</p>, <p>—He seems to have changed a little when he was young but don't we all change after we reach a certain age? You've certainly changed a lot once you reached your teens. Uagh... Just thinking about what I had to go through.</p>, <p>Listening to his voice, her lips pulled into a slight pout. It was mainly because it was a voice message and she couldn't answer back.</p>, <p>'....What change? I'm the same.'</p>, <p>—This is all I was able to find. I'm not sure why you're interested in him, but this is all I could find for you. If you have anything else you want to ask me, you can just come visit me at the office. You know where to find me.</p>, <p>The voice message ended there.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Aoife stood alone with a frown. She wasn't satisfied with what she received from her uncle. In fact, Aoife was even more certain that something was up.</p>, <p>\"He's not the type to answer like that.\"</p>, <p>Atlas. Her uncle. He was usually very thorough with his research.</p>, <p>The last time she had asked him to do something like this, he had given her a thorough file with all sorts of details.</p>, <p>\"It's odd.\"</p>, <p>But at the same time, she didn't understand why her uncle of all people would lie to her.</p>, <p>.....Was there some sort of secret that she wasn't supposed to be aware of? Something that only a few members of the royal family knew?</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>The more Aoife thought about it, the stranger she felt the situation was.</p>, <p>\"Aoife! Are you coming? Next class is about to start!\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...!? Yes.\"</p>, <p>In the end, however, she was unable to think further as someone called out for her. Quickly putting the communication device away, Aoife cleared her throat and followed.</p>, <p>As she walked, her hand kept fiddling over the communication device.</p>, <p>Something was up.</p>, <p>But for now...</p>, <p>Aoife took a deep breath.</p>, <p>'I'll take things slowly.'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was early in the morning of the next day.</p>, <p>\"Huaam.\"</p>, <p>Yawning, Kiera looked at the time. It was exactly 5:30 in the morning. Today was Saturday and so there were no lessons.</p>, <p>It was supposed to be her day off, but...</p>, <p>\"Fuck.\"</p>, <p>Regret had already made its way into Kiera's mind.</p>, <p>\"What was I even on?\"</p>, <p>Ruffling her hair, Kiera dressed herself in casual clothes. Cotton white shirt, some jeans, and a white hat. This was how she usually dressed on weekends.</p>, <p>Coming out of her room, she did one last check of the place before coming down to the ground floor.</p>, <p>'He said he'll wait for me there...'</p>, <p>Indeed, the moment Kiera came down, she saw him sitting by himself on one of the tables with several books open and a 00:30</p>, <p>small pile of papers on his right. Judging from the empty cup of coffee on his side and the several books open, he appeared to have been here long before the arranged time.</p>, <p>\"Crazy bastard.\"</p>, <p>The more time she spent with him, the more of a lunatic Julien appeared in her eyes.</p>, <p>He was simply...</p>, <p>Inhuman.</p>, <p>If he wasn't studying, he was training, and if he wasn't training, he was studying. In Kiera's mind, it was starting to make sense how someone like him was able to remain at the top.</p>, <p>Even Leon and Aoife weren't as crazy as him.</p>, <p>\"Oy, I'm here.\"</p>, <p>Calling out for him, Kiera sat down on the seat opposite him.</p>, <p>\".....What do I do?\"</p>, <p>As she asked, she placed the book she brought from her dorm onto the table; [Magic Theory]</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>Flipping it open, she paused on the last page she was on.</p>, <p>\"I-\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Kiera was stopped halfway through her sentence. Blinking, she looked up to meet Julien's hazel eyes. Before she could say anything, he pointed at the piles of papers on his right.</p>, <p>\"You're doing those.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Kiera closed her book without saying a word. She then stood up and turned around. Yeah, fuck that... But just as she was about to leave, Julien's cold voice echoed from behind her.</p>, <p>\"You were the one who asked me to help you.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, yeah but...\"</p>, <p>\"Do you want to pass or not?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Kiera's face scrunched up. Pass... She wanted to pass. No, she had to pass. It was a requirement her father had set for her in other to stay. Were she not pass, then she'd have to quit the Academy.</p>, <p>'I can't have that.'</p>, <p>It wasn't that she liked the Academy. However, it was less stifling than her home. There was no way she'd want to go back there.</p>, <p>\"Ugh.\"</p>, <p>In the end, despite every part of her not wanting to be here, she sat back down.</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, she took one of the sheets. There were over a hundred of them.</p>, <p>'I'll never be able to finish them...'</p>, <p>As she groaned, her eyes paused on the first question.</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>A strange sound came out of her mouth the moment she stared at the paper. Blinking several times to make sure she was seeing correctly, her head flicked up.</p>, <p>Without hesitation, she went on to grab another paper.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened yet again.</p>, <p>Opening her mouth, Kiera found herself losing her words. But in the end, grabbing another sheet, she managed to say,</p>, <p>\"....Did you write all the questions yourself?\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"....Ugh.\"</p>, <p>Kiera groaned while staring at the paper in front of her. How much time had passed since she started? Staring at the clock, her expression twisted.</p>, <p>Three hours...</p>, <p>Kiera looked up with a hopeful look.</p>, <p>\"Can I take a break?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\".....I'm going to die.\"</p>, <p>Kiera sprawled over her desk and groaned. She felt lightheaded and her body felt limp. She didn't feel like doing anything.</p>, <p>Akh. How many problems have I solved already...?</p>, <p>Too many. It was too many.</p>, <p>No, but that wasn't the problem. Frowning, Kiera raised her head and glared at Julien.</p>, <p>\"Oy, at least teach me something! I've been spending all my time doing these damn questions. You've yet to teach me anything!\"</p>, <p>Kiera was starting to get pissed off. Throughout the entire three hours that she had spent here, she had yet to learn anything from him. All she did was solve the questions in front of her.</p>, <p>....He had done nothing to help her the entire time.</p>, <p>\"At least tell me how to solve this question. I've been stuck on it for the past thirty minutes.\"</p>, <p>Kiera pushed the paper Julien's way.</p>, <p>The entire time he had been absorbed in reading his book. Finally, taking his eyes away from the book in his hands, he looked up at her. Their eyes met and he closed the book in his hands.</p>, <p>Julien, who had been absorbed in his own studies, turned his attention to the question sheet.</p>, <p>\"Rune study?\"</p>, <p>\".....Yes. I don't know how to do it.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>Julien nodded briefly before turning his attention towards the books scattered across the table. Carefully looking through them, he picked a book up and handed it to her.</p>, <p>\"The answer is in here.\"</p>, <p>He then returned his attention back on his book.</p>, <p>\"....Uh?\"</p>, <p>Stunned, Kiera alternated her gaze between the book and him. What sort of nonsense...?</p>, <p>\"The fuck? Aren't you supposed to teach me? I'm not paying so much money for you to tell me to look at a book. I can just-\"</p>, <p>\"That's not it.\"</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>Julien flipped to the next page of the book he was reading. Without taking his eyes away from it, he went on to explain.</p>, <p>\"I'm not here to teach you how to solve a problem.\"</p>, <p>\"Wh-\"</p>, <p>\"I'm here to teach you how to study.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Lifting his gaze, their eyes met.</p>, <p> \"I'm not here to coddle you.\"</p>, <p>His tone lowered. So much so that Kiera suddenly found herself unconsciously sitting up straight. Wait, what the fuck?</p>, <p>\".....I can teach you. I don't have a problem with that. Teaching others is one of the best methods to learn.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...?\"</p>, <p>\"What about you? What will you do when I no longer decide to teach you or you run out of money?\"</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>Kiera frowned. She didn't really know how to answer. What will she do? Would she just hire another tutor, or just go back to her old ways?</p>, <p>\"I'm not here to teach you subjects. That's the Professor's job. I'm here to teach you how to take care of yourself for the future.\"</p>, <p>Julien pressed his hand against the book and pushed it back.</p>, <p>\".....I won't always be here to teach you. You need to learn to be self-reliant. If you want to improve your grades you should first learn to do it without relying on others. People will only help you out so much. The one person who will never fail you is yourself. Rely on yourself.\"</p>, <p>Kiera lowered her gaze to stare at the book in front of her. Doing so, her brows furrowed. She was just about to say something when she noticed his gaze.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>The words that she was about to say never left her mouth. Eventually, she took the book and opened it.</p>, <p>\".....What am I supposed to do now?\"</p>, <p>\"You look for the answer.\"</p>, <p>\"Is that it? I can do that my-\"</p>, <p>\"Discipline first. You need to learn to be disciplined. If I tell you the answer, you'll eventually forget it. The same isn't true if you figure it out yourself. You need to discipline yourself to find the answer without asking. Don't look for a lazy way out.\"</p>, <p>\"Ugh.\"</p>, <p>Groaning, Kiera proceeded to look for the answer.</p>, <p>'Fucking bastard. Just say that you don't want to teach me... No need to come up with such a roundabout way of saying it.'</p>, <p>\"Ah, found it!\"</p>, <p>It took her several minutes but she eventually found the answer. Her eyes lit up and she quickly started to fill the answer sheet.</p>, <p>Kiera felt a weird feeling of satisfaction as she answered the question.</p>, <p>It was hard to describe, and her lips unconsciously pulled up. Trying her best to keep them even, she went on to the next question.</p>, <p>Yet again it was a complicated question and she looked up at Julien.</p>, <p>\"What about this one? How do I—Ah.\"</p>, <p>Halfway through her sentence she realized her mistake and covered her mouth.</p>, <p>\"Fuck, this...\"</p>, <p>Pursing her lips, she looked around and found the right book, [Body Studies], before proceeding to find the right answer. There were times when she wasn't sure about the answer even with the aid of the book, and ended up writing whatever she could piece together with the information.</p>, <p>Either way, Julien would just ignore her every attempt to talk to him.</p>, <p>At some point, she stopped looking for him and just focused on her task at hand.</p>, <p>\"Ah, so it's like this.\"</p>, <p>\"Ugh, fuck... My head hurts. I want to take a break.\"</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>\"I want to die.\"</p>, <p>\"I'm dead.\"</p>, <p>\"...Oh, so it's like this.\"</p>, <p>Throughout the hours of the study session, Kiera would always let out an occasional complaint. However, despite that, she would always recover after swearing for a good minute.</p>, <p>Time ticked and before anyone knew it, a few more hours passed.</p>, <p>\"...Uh?\"</p>, <p>Opening her eyes, Kiera looked around her.</p>, <p>\"The hell?\"</p>, <p>Looking around, she noticed that it was dark outside. Wiping the saliva from her mouth using her wrist, she blinked several times.</p>, <p>\"What time is it?\"</p>, <p>Before she knew it, she had fallen asleep.</p>, <p>\"....Ah!\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened when she looked at the clock.</p>, <p>It was 10 P.M.</p>, <p>Abruptly, Kiera stood up and raised her head.</p>, <p>\"Hey, shithead! Why didn't you wake me u—Uh?\"</p>, <p>Kiera stopped and looked towards the empty seat in front of her. Realization soon dawned on her and she slumped back in her chair.</p>, <p>\"Ah, fuck. He left didn't he?\"</p>, <p>Ruffling her hair, Kiera blankly stared at the ceiling.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She felt lightheaded and drained. She would much rather prefer his hellish training than this. Even so...</p>, <p>\"....I guess I did good.\"</p>, <p>Kiera felt a certain sense of satisfaction from having gotten so much work done. Usually, she wouldn't have done more than ten minutes' worth of work. That would in turn make her feel like shit for an entire day.</p>, <p>Things were different now.</p>, <p>\"I could get used to this feeling.\"</p>, <p>It didn't feel so bad.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"....That fucker really went ahead and left without waking me up.\"</p>, <p>It sort of pissed her off.</p>, <p>\"If that bastard charges me even a single extra Rend then—</p>, <p>Hm?\"</p>, <p>Pausing, Kiera's gaze fell on the papers in front of her. She hadn't noticed because it was dark, but waving her hand, a trail of flames manifested in the air illuminating the surroundings.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>Kiera's eyes widened.</p>, <p>Taking a closer look at the paper, her eyes paused on the numerous notes around it. There was also a mark written above each paper.</p>, <p>&lt;39/100&gt;</p>, <p>[You did better here. However, there are a lot of areas you can improve on. For example, for this question, the answer was the 'Alpha Rune' rather than the 'Delta Rune'. Compared to the 'Delta Rune' which speeds up the gathering of mana, the 'Alpha Rune' slows it down so that the flow is smoother. For the spell [Fire Veil] the 'Alpha Rune' is more appropriate as the spell would shatter if created too fast...]</p>, <p>For every question that Kiera got wrong, she'd receive a long detailed explanation of what she did wrong and what the real answer was.</p>, <p>\"What in the...\"</p>, <p>Dropping the first paper, Kiera looked at the other papers.</p>, <p>Flip. Flip. Flip—</p>, <p>Kiera quickly skimmed through the numerous papers. Her expression changed with each paper that she looked through.</p>, <p>She couldn't believe what she was seeing.</p>, <p>All the papers. They were the same. Filled with the same notes and corrections.</p>, <p>Kiera had done a lot of questions today. There were at least more than a couple hundred.</p>, <p>Counting all the ones she got wrong...</p>, <p>\"Fuuuuck.\"</p>, <p>Kiera let out a slow curse.</p>, <p>It was no wonder he didn't wake her up. How long did it take him to do all of this?</p>, <p>\"This guy is crazy.\"</p>, <p>Batshit crazy.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>Flipping another one of the assignments, she noticed a note slipping from it.</p>, <p>\"....Uh?\"</p>, <p>Picking it up, Kiera noticed that there was something written on it.</p>, <p>Curious, Kiera read what was written on it.</p>, <p>[You owe me 700 Rend. I won't count the time you were sleeping. Make sure you pay up. Come at the same time tomorrow.]</p>, <p>The note ended there.</p>, <p>It was short but the meaning was clear.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Staring at it with a blank look, Kiera's lips pursed. Then, looking down at the documents and seeing all the notes written, she crumbled up the note in her hand.</p>, <p>\".....This isn't good for me.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>From that day onward, Kiera showed up every morning at the exact same time. There was a noticeable difference in her attitude compared to the first time she came.</p>, <p>While she did occasionally grumble, it wasn't as much as before.</p>, <p>In fact, most of the time she would remain silent while solving the problems next to Julien. It was an odd sight.</p>, <p>The two of them studying together.</p>, <p>\"I'm not seeing things wrong, right?\"</p>, <p>\"Is this for real?\"</p>, <p>\"Quickly pinch my face so that I-Akh!\"</p>, <p>Given how contrasting their personalities were, nobody expected such a development.</p>, <p>Regardless, nobody dared to ask anything about it. Julien and Kiera weren't exactly the easiest people to talk to.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Despite what seemed to be a tense atmosphere around the two, the reality was that it was strangely peaceful.</p>, <p>At least to Kiera who did nothing but focus on the questions.</p>, <p>\"Ah, so it's like that...\"</p>, <p>It was an odd feeling for her. She couldn't quite explain why she was like that. However, she had an idea of why.</p>, <p>Looking up slightly, her eyes paused on the figure that sat opposite her.</p>, <p>For the first time ever, she looked at him properly. From his neatly arranged hair and suit to his careful movements as he flipped over the pages.</p>, <p>He appeared flawless in everything that he did, but...</p>, <p>'His eyes.'</p>, <p>Just faintly, Kiera could see the dark circles beneath his eyes.</p>, <p>She pursed her lips at the sight as her head lowered to stare at the question sheet beneath her.</p>, <p>The reason behind his dark circles was clear to her. It didn't take a genius to understand. It was all because of her...</p>, <p>If she didn't...</p>, <p>'No, fuck.'</p>, <p>Kiera snapped out of it.</p>, <p>'Right, I need to focus.'</p>, <p>This wasn't the time for her to feel guilty. She needed to focus on studying. Looking away from Julien, Kiera once again locked in and started to fill in the questions.</p>, <p>With each passing day, the number of mistakes she'd make would decrease.</p>, <p>[51/100]</p>, <p>[67/100]</p>, <p>[73/100]</p>, <p>[81/100]</p>, <p>Seeing the noticeable improvement in her score, Kiera felt a strange sensation. It was hard to describe, but it filled her chest up with a pleasant feeling.</p>, <p>It felt addicting and she slowly started to look forward to the lessons. It was odd, but this was starting to become the reality of her life.</p>, <p>That was until...</p>, <p>\"Everyone, the exam will be starting soon. You already know the rules so I won't repeat them.\"</p>, <p>The day of the exam finally came.</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, Kiera stared at the paper in front of her. For some reason, she was shaking.</p>, <p>Holding her arm down she cursed to herself.</p>, <p>'T-the hell is wrong with you, stupid bitch? This isn't the time to be nervous.'</p>, <p>No, in the first place, why did she even feel nervous? She had prepared so much for it. Realistically speaking, she was ready.</p>, <p>So...</p>, <p>Why?</p>, <p>Why was she so nervous...?</p>, <p>Gradually, her head turned and her eyes locked on a certain person. An idea occurred to her and her expression twisted.</p>, <p>'No, no way.'</p>, <p>Clenching her teeth, she looked away from him.</p>, <p>Fuck that...</p>, <p>It was a ridiculous idea.</p>, <p>'It's not that.'</p>, <p>Kiera stubbornly clung to her refusal. Amidst her struggle, the Professor's voice echoed loudly.</p>, <p>\"You may begin! Best of luck!\"</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>The classroom was filled with the simultaneous sound of pages turning as the cadets flipped through their textbooks in unison. Kiera joined them, and as she turned a page, her expression froze.</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>A soft laugh unconsciously escaped her lips as she stared at the question in front of her.</p>, <p>She didn't know how to react.</p>, <p>The question...</p>, <p>'I know it.'</p>, <p>She had done it before.</p>, <p>For the first time in a very long time, Kiera smiled.</p>, <p>It was a genuine smile.</p>, <p>And her pencil touched the paper.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"That's it. Pencils down!\"</p>, <p>The exam ran for exactly an hour. Hearing Professor Bridgette's voice, I put my pencil down and rubbed my eyes.</p>, <p>\"Huaam.\"</p>, <p>I unknowingly let out a yawn.</p>, <p>I was quite frankly tired. But it was a different kind of tiredness from the usual tiredness. For the entire week, I hadn't trained at all.</p>, <p>Not because I didn't want to but because I physically couldn't.</p>, <p>My body was still suffering from the consequences of having used the drug. I was still unsure of how long I was going to be like this.</p>, <p>While it sucked, it was also a good thing in its own way.</p>, <p>I had beaten up my body far too much over the past few months. It needed a well-deserved break.</p>, <p>That being said...</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>I pinched the middle of my brows.</p>, <p>My head was hurting.</p>, <p>I was mentally exhausted. To compensate for the lack of training, I dedicated the entire week to studying. Not only that, but I also spent a major part of the time creating questions for Kiera.</p>, <p>In a way, it also helped me out a lot.</p>, <p>Staring at the question paper in front of me, I felt rather confident.</p>, <p>'I might even be able to get full marks.'</p>, <p>It wasn't exactly out of the question.</p>, <p>'.....I might not have slept much over the past week, but it ended up benefitting me a lot.'</p>, <p>The questions that I created for Kiera weren't some random questions that I copied from some exercise book. I had created each question myself. Before each question, I'd spend a decent amount of time studying the related subject before writing it down.</p>, <p>I only felt comfortable writing it down once I was confident I could answer it without any difficulty.</p>, <p>It was extremely tough on the mind but it ended up helping me big time.</p>, <p>....And it paid as well. It was a win-win situation for me.</p>, <p>'Talking about the exam, how did she do?'</p>, <p>I was a little curious.</p>, <p>She did after all pay me to learn.</p>, <p>I had just turned my head to stare in her direction when my eyes locked on her figure. Leaning back on her chair, she looked at her nails with a casual look. Almost as if she was expecting something.</p>, <p>The hell...</p>, <p>\"Kiera, how did you do?\"</p>, <p>That question was what she expected as she casually looked away from her nails to look at Josephine.</p>, <p>She lightly shrugged her shoulders while opening her palm to get a better look at her nails.</p>, <p>\"Well, just the usual.\"</p>, <p>\"So like shit?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? No...?\"</p>, <p>Kiera blinked and her facade broke in an instant.</p>, <p> \"No?\"</p>, <p>Josephine tilted her head with a frown.</p>, <p>\"But isn't your usual shit? Like, lowest of the class type st-\"</p>, <p>\"Ugh, fuck. Alright, stop.\"</p>, <p>Kiera clicked her tongue and looked away. Drumming her hand over the table, her expression twisted. She looked rather grumpy.</p>, <p>I could tell at a glance what she was thinking.</p>, <p>I shook my head and almost laughed. What a weird girl. I was just about to turn my head away when her head turned and I locked sight with her ruby-red eyes.</p>, <p>Her expression changed slightly.</p>, <p>Staring at her for a moment, I eventually mouthed.</p>, <p>'Good job.'</p>, <p>Her brows jumped up slightly and her head turned. I shook my head yet again and covered my mouth.</p>, <p>\"Huam.\"</p>, <p>Yeah, I really need to sleep.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\".....I guess we have come to an agreement.\"</p>, <p>A man stood up and extended his hand towards Delilah.</p>, <p>\"It's also perfect that I came at this time. I heard that the cadets are going on a trip. I hope you won't mind if I join.\"</p>, <p>\"I don't.\"</p>, <p>Delilah shook the man's hand.</p>, <p>\"Great.\"</p>, <p>With a happy smile, he lowered his head before putting his hat back on. Then, lowering his hat slightly, he excused himself and left the room.</p>, <p>\"Well then, I'll be seeing you again.\"</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>The door closed leaving Delilah standing by herself. Staring in the direction of where the man had left, Delilah closed her eyes and sighed.</p>, <p>\"Inquisitor Hallowe.\"</p>, <p>Muttering to herself, she leaned to sit over her desk.</p>, <p>Her current feelings were mixed. Inquisitor Hallowe was a man of reputation. He was amongst the best Inquisitors within the Empire. In a sense, he was an 'ally'.</p>, <p>His nickname was 'The Hound'.</p>, <p>So long as he had a target, he'd find it no matter what. It wasn't just that, he was also extremely well-versed in finding clues and leads.</p>, <p>He was that type of person.</p>, <p>But there was one problem.</p>, <p>\".....He works for Central.\"</p>, <p>That meant that he was directly under her father's orders. Delilah didn't feel comfortable knowing that.</p>, <p>Especially since she wasn't sure about his motives.</p>, <p>Was he here to monitor her, or was he here to carry on with his investigation?</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Delilah pinched her brows. Her head was starting to ache. However, she soon calmed down.</p>, <p>\"Right, he's going on the trip.\"</p>, <p>....The one that the first-year cadets were meant to go to. In that case, at least for now, she didn't need to worry about him monitoring her actions.</p>, <p>Rather, perhaps she was overthinking and he had indeed come on his own terms.</p>, <p>\"It might be that.\"</p>, <p>She couldn't guarantee it, but at the very least, for now, she didn't have to worry about him.</p>, <p>Turning around, she reached for her drawer.</p>, <p>She needed something sweet at the moment. Something to take her mind off of the matter.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Opening her drawer, all she saw were wrappers.</p>, <p>\"....Ah.\"</p>, <p>Blinking, she slumped over her chair and blankly stared at the ceiling.</p>, <p>\"What is life.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The next day, 11:30 A.M. on a Tuesday.</p>, <p>I arrived at the entrance of the Academy. I was among the last to come as most of the cadets were already present. They all appeared excited about the upcoming trip.</p>, <p>Me? Not so much.</p>, <p>'.....Just get it over with.'</p>, <p>The damn quest.</p>, <p>I had been waiting for it for an entire week, and yet, it had still yet to come.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>It was tiring.</p>, <p>\"Everyone give me a second of your attention. I'd like to introduce you to someone.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette was the one in charge of escorting us towards the location. Standing next to her was a man with black hair and hazel eyes. He appeared somewhat haggard with stubbles around his chin.</p>, <p>His hair also appeared to be in a mess, but other than that his appearance was clean.</p>, <p>\"You may address him as Professor Hollowe. He will accompany us on the trip.\"</p>, <p>It was a rather short introduction. One that the cadets forgot shortly after as Professor Bridgette went on to say.</p>, <p>\"Once we arrive at the city you can take some time off for yourselves. But before that, you will be paired up in groups of two. The groups will be random.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette flashed a small box.</p>, <p>\".....Please line up in a single line.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>Ellnor.</p>, <p>Coming out of the portal, the first thing that hit me was the fresh air. The first breath felt almost overwhelming.</p>, <p>Then, it was the scenery that took my breath away.</p>, <p>'Wow.'</p>, <p>Large, towering mountains framed the horizon as a town appeared in my sight, enclosed by thick walls. With just one glance I was impressed by the sight before me. It looked like a scene straight from a fantasy book.</p>, <p>I wanted to get a better look at it from up close.</p>, <p>\"Brrr~ It's cold.\"</p>, <p>Stepping out beside me, Josephine held onto her shoulders.</p>, <p>\"T-this... Why did no one tell me it was going to be this cold?\"</p>, <p>\"F-fucking idiot. It literally said in t-the announcement.\"</p>, <p>\"O-oh, yeah? T-then why are you in s-short sleeves?\"</p>, <p>\"I- I c-can take it.\"</p>, <p>Kiera tried to maintain a poker face but she was miserably failing as her lips started to tremble. Coming out from behind them was Aoife who paused to look at the scene before turning away.</p>, <p>Something told me she wasn't even surprised by what she was seeing.</p>, <p>'Why is she carrying so many books with her?'</p>, <p>In her hand were several books. Was she planning on studying?</p>, <p>But exams were over...</p>, <p>'Whatever. None of my business.'</p>, <p>Taking my eyes away from them, I looked to my right where a figure stood. Wearing a large coat that seemed to be way too big for him, Leon stared at me.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>His coat was so large that the only thing I could see was his gray eyes.</p>, <p>Noticing my gaze, he asked,</p>, <p>\"....What?\"</p>, <p>\"You look stupid.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Leon cocked his head.</p>, <p>\"It said it was going to be cold.\"</p>, <p>\"And?\"</p>, <p>\"So I came prepared.\"</p>, <p>\"Too prepared...\"</p>, <p>It wasn't as though we couldn't use the mana inside of our body to heat ourselves up. At the same time, our bodies were also a lot more resistant to the cold.</p>, <p>He was simply being extra.</p>, <p>\"Everyone please look over here.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette waved at us with her hand.</p>, <p>\"Like we discussed beforehand. You can take your time to explore the city. However, you must make sure that you stay with your partner. Don't separate.\"</p>, <p>My partner was Leon. I was fine with such a pairing. He was the one person I was the most comfortable being with. Not only because he knew my secret, but also because I didn't necessarily have to pretend to be someone else with him.</p>, <p>\"It's still early in the morning. Let's meet up for dinner which will be at around 8 P.M. I wish you all the best of fun enjoying your short break.\"</p>, <p>Then, Professor Bridgette left alongside Professor Hollowe who smiled and nodded at all of us. For some reason, I felt his gaze pause on me for a bit longer.</p>, <p>I thought I was imagining things, but thinking about it...</p>, <p>'Yeah, no way I am.'</p>, <p>He was definitely looking at me.</p>, <p>I sighed internally. Hopefully, it was because of a stupid reason such as because he was a fan of mine or something like that.</p>, <p>Either way, I looked at Leon.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>He stared back at me with a blank look.</p>, <p>I spoke first.</p>, <p>\"So... What do you want to do?\"</p>, <p>I looked around me. The other groups were still around, most probably talking about their plans.</p>, <p>\"We have about eight to nine hours to kill. What do you want to do?\"</p>, <p>\"...Up to you.\"</p>, <p>\"That...\"</p>, <p>I sighed and nodded my head.</p>, <p>\"Alright, let's just get into the city first. We'll decide what do to later.\"</p>, <p>\"....Okay.\"</p>, <p>I looked ahead and a long road appeared. Briefly, I glanced at the mountains in the distance. I could see snow at the top.</p>, <p>The rocky landscape lacked greenery, with smoke billowing from within the city walls, starkly contrasting against the barren backdrop, faintly illuminated by the glow coming from the houses within the city.</p>, <p>I had just taken a step when I felt a tug from behind me.</p>, <p>\"Hey.\"</p>, <p>It was Leon.</p>, <p>He appeared to be frowning behind his large coat.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\".....I don't look stupid.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>A large gate stood before the walls of the city. As we approached, the gates parted, welcoming us into the heart of the city.</p>, <p>A sprawling cobblestone road unfolded before us, lined with sturdy wooden houses and bustling stalls beneath them.</p>, <p>\"Get your fresh vegetables here! They're fresh from Arkana! You won't find fresher vegetables!\"</p>, <p>\"Buy one get one free!\"</p>, <p>\"Limited sale for today only!\"</p>, <p>The scene was filled with clamor as the stall owners shouted on top of each other, trying their best to entice the crowd walking around the road.</p>, <p>I was left stunned by the unexpected sight before me.</p>, <p>'....This is a lot more lively than I originally anticipated.'</p>, <p>For a town located in the middle of nowhere, it sure seemed rather lively.</p>, <p>\"Welcome to Ellnor.\"</p>, <p>Guards dressed in light armor welcomed us into the city. As if expecting our appearance, we didn't need to go through any checks and entered without problems.</p>, <p>As Leon and I passed the guards, I took notice of the strange looks that they were giving Leon.</p>, <p>He seemed to have noticed them too as he frowned.</p>, <p>I nudged slightly with my chin.</p>, <p>\"See? They also think that you look stupid.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Without saying a word, Leon went on to take off his coat. The stares were starting to get to him. It was quite funny though. He seemed to be the type of guy to take anything literally.</p>, <p>\"Now then.\"</p>, <p>I looked at the town in front of me and rubbed my stomach.</p>, <p>\".....Should we get something to eat first?\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>The town of Ellnor was a lot bigger than I originally anticipated.</p>, <p>In fact, it seemed to have everything that one would want from a major city. Restaurants, cafes, hotels, theaters, and even casinos.</p>, <p>\"....Casinos?\"</p>, <p>That...</p>, <p>I stopped to stare at the large building to my right. It was an eye-catching building. With the words [Casino] imprinted on the wooden board on top, a long line formed at the entrance of the building as several individuals stood by the entrance to check who entered.</p>, <p>'There's casinos in this world?'</p>, <p>The sight was something that I didn't think I could ever get used to. It just simply didn't make sense to me.</p>, <p>How could...</p>, <p>'No, never mind. I'm not here to question the decision of the game developers.'</p>, <p>This world. It wasn't fully medieval in style. I had long noticed this. There were a lot of modern touches added here and there.</p>, <p>'It's a mix of both, I guess.'</p>, <p>Medieval and modern.</p>, <p>\".....Do you want to go to the casino?\"</p>, <p>Hearing Leon's voice from beside me, I shook my head.</p>, <p> \"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Then?\"</p>, <p>\"I was just looking.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>I tilted my head slightly to look at Leon. Why did it seem like he was disappointed?</p>, <p>\"You want to go?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>So he did.</p>, <p>Well,</p>, <p>\"Maybe later. Let's get some food first.\"</p>, <p>\"....Alright.\"</p>, <p>A large river crossed the middle of the town. With the water coming down directly from the mountains above, it was extremely clear.</p>, <p>Around that area were several restaurants and stores. Leon and I settled for whatever looked good. Neither one of us was a picky eater so it didn't really matter.</p>, <p>\"I'll take this.\"</p>, <p>The dish that I ordered was [Ember Roast] a slow-cooked roast that came from the meat of an Ember, an infant-ranked monster. It apparently had the properties of helping the muscles of the body recover so I deemed it fit considering my situation.</p>, <p>Once I was done ordering, I put the menu down and waited for Leon.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"....Hmm.\"</p>, <p>He seemed indecisive about what to choose.</p>, <p>\"There's so much...\"</p>, <p>No, rather, overwhelmed seemed to be more fitting.</p>, <p>What in the...</p>, <p>\"....This one looks nice too. Ah, no, but this one too.\"</p>, <p>Leon went on to run his forehead.</p>, <p>\"What a dilemma.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>This carried on for the next few minutes until I couldn't stand it any longer and spoke up.</p>, <p>\"Are you ordering or not?\"</p>, <p>\".....Ah.\"</p>, <p>Leon made a difficult face. Then, looking at the waiter who also appeared exhausted, he went on to point at the menu.</p>, <p>\"I want this.\"</p>, <p>\"Starfire Curry?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Und-\"</p>, <p>\"And this.\"</p>, <p>The waiter paused. Looking at the menu, his gaze fell on me.</p>, <p>\".....Ember Roast? The same as him.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes, that too.\"</p>, <p>\"Under-\"</p>, <p>\"And this.\"</p>, <p>Leon cut the waiter again as he pointed at another dish.</p>, <p>\"....Wild dragonfish steak?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Ok-\"</p>, <p>\"Also this.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"This one too. I want to try it.\"</p>, <p>\"How spicy is this one? If it isn't too spicy, I'll take this one too.\"</p>, <p>I sat baffled staring at Leon as he pointed at the dishes on the menu. Just how much is he going to eat...? What in the world?</p>, <p>\"I'll finish off with this.\"</p>, <p>Plak—</p>, <p>Leon closed the menu with satisfaction. Just as he did, he frowned and opened it again, but as his eyes scanned the menu and he found nothing else, 'Plak—' he closed it again and nodded.</p>, <p>\"Yes, that will be it.\"</p>, <p>\"I-\"</p>, <p>The waiter appeared to want to say something but held himself back. I couldn't blame him. In the end, Leon had ordered every single dish on the menu. He ended up wasting so much time when he could've just said 'I want it all'.</p>, <p>'This guy...\"</p>, <p>Letting out a short sigh, I turned my head to stare at the scenery before me. It was stunning. From the tall mountains in the distance to the crystal clear river that passed through the middle of the town.</p>, <p>It gave off a completely different vibe than the Academy.</p>, <p>In a way, it was a nice change of pace.</p>, <p>\"You know...\"</p>, <p>Taking me out of my thoughts was Leon's voice as I turned my head to meet his gaze. The way he was looking at me was strange.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\".....You've changed.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>What nonsense...?</p>, <p>\"I don't know. You just seem so different than the first time that I met you.\"</p>, <p>\"....In what way?\"</p>, <p>I didn't feel like I had changed at all if I had to be honest. Was he perhaps talking about my strength?</p>, <p>If so...</p>, <p>\"That-\"</p>, <p>\"You were smiling.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I opened my eyes wide and touched my lips.</p>, <p>'I was smiling? When...?'</p>, <p>\"I don't think I've ever seen you smile at all. It's weird actually.\"</p>, <p>He rubbed his arms and looked at me with an uncomfortable look.</p>, <p>\"....Goosebumps.\"</p>, <p>\"What? The fact that I smile?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah. It's weird.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>The fact that he agreed without even an ounce of hesitation was what took the words away from me.</p>, <p>Me smiling. Was it really that weird?</p>, <p>\"Is it bad that I smiled?\"</p>, <p>Was this his way of telling me that I was losing sight of the facade that I was trying to keep?</p>, <p>If so...</p>, <p>\"Don't worry, I w-\"</p>, <p>\"No, not really.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>I blinked yet again.</p>, <p>\"What do you mean, not really?\"</p>, <p>\"It's a good thing, I think.\"</p>, <p>\"You think?\"</p>, <p>I looked around before whispering.</p>, <p>\"Wasn't the whole point of me doing the act so that I wouldn't be found out by the others?\"</p>, <p>\"....It was, yes.\"</p>, <p>\"Then?\"</p>, <p>\"You didn't look like a person that wanted to live.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Stunned, I looked at him. I opened my mouth, but the words that I tried to get out refused to leave. Regardless of how hard I tried, I couldn't find the words to refute him.</p>, <p>He continued,</p>, <p>\"I don't know about your past. In fact, I don't know much about you at all. The only thing that I can tell is that you're trying to achieve something.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"But whatever you're trying to do. It's eating at you from the inside. Or at least, used to.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"You seem more at peace lately. I don't know why. It's just that...\"</p>, <p>Leon paused to look back. The waiter was coming with several dishes and a nice smell wafted through the air.</p>, <p>Wiping the corner of his mouth, he turned to look at me slightly.</p>, <p>\".....It doesn't look like you want to die anymore.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>At the same time, in a different part of the town.</p>, <p>\"We have a situation.\"</p>, <p>Kiera stared at Josephine with a serious look. Rubbing her head, she looked to be struggling.</p>, <p>\"What? What?\"</p>, <p>Josephine looked at Kiera with a worried look.</p>, <p>\"Tell me what's wrong.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, well...\"</p>, <p>Kiera eventually shook her head.</p>, <p>\"No, never mind. It's nothing.\"</p>, <p>\"Nnng? Come. Just tell me. Now I'm curious.\"</p>, <p>\"I'm telling you, it's nothing.\"</p>, <p>\"No, just tell me! You can't just do that and act like nothing happened.\"</p>, <p>\"Haa, fuck. Whatever. You're so fucking annoying.\"</p>, <p>Glaring at Josephine, Kiera whispered something in her ear.</p>, <p>\"Eh...? Ah. So it's just that?\"</p>, <p>\"What do you mean just that?\"</p>, <p>\"Well, it's normal, you know... Ah geez~ I thought it was something serious.\"</p>, <p>\"Oy bitch, it is serious.\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Go to the bathroom. I'll wait for you here.\"</p>, <p>\"Are you for real?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>, <p>\".....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>Kiera muttered her words of thanks with a soft whisper. One that Josephine pretended to not have heard as she brought her hand near her ear.</p>, <p>\"What? I didn't hear.\"</p>, <p>\"Fuck off.\"</p>, <p>Flipping her off, Kiera walked in the direction of the bathroom.</p>, <p>Gradually her back faded into the crowd, and as it did, so did her direction.</p>, <p>\"Hmm~\"</p>, <p>And she started to hum to herself.</p>, <p>Turning to face the opposite direction, she headed toward a large building in the distance. One that said,</p>, <p>'Casino'</p>, <p>\"Hmmm~\"</p>, <p>Just like that, 'Kiera' had vanished.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>On the outer walls of the town.</p>, <p>\"....How is the situation? Do you notice anything out of order?\"</p>, <p>\"Not yet.\"</p>, <p>Two knights stood at the top of the walls, carefully overlooking the outside of the town with grim looks. The knight's captain, Sir Tristan Blackwood, a Tier 3 Knigth, and a man in his mid-forties took out his pocket watch to look at the time.</p>, <p>\"It's still early. We have time before the next wave.\"</p>, <p>\"H-hoo.\"</p>, <p>The other knight let out a nervous breath.</p>, <p>\".....What do you think? Do you think we can survive this one?\"</p>, <p>\"I'm sure of that.\"</p>, <p>Sir Tristan answered with a confident look. Turning his head, he looked towards the town beneath.</p>, <p>It was currently bustling with activity. From where he stood, he could see the smiles and happy expressions of the citizens.</p>, <p>But of course...</p>, <p>'They're used to it.'</p>, <p>Despite its outer appearance, the town was cursed. Behind their smiles was... a pain that only they could understand.</p>, <p>Sir Tristan Blackwood was one such person.</p>, <p>He understood their pain all too well.</p>, <p>'I'll be coming back soon. It's a promise. Keep this for me.'</p>, <p>Even now, he could still hear the sound of his sister's voice as she ventured outside of the town's walls.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>That had been thirty years ago. He had barely been eight back then. His sister... she didn't keep her promise.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, he put the pocket watch away.</p>, <p>The pocket watch. It was a gift from his sister. It was meant to have been a temporary gift to him. He was meant to use it to keep track of the time that she was away.</p>, <p>To this day, he hadn't stopped counting.</p>, <p>For what reason was he so uselessly clinging to the idea of his sister coming back?</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>The captain laughed to himself.</p>, <p>\"Get the preparations ready. I'll be leaving for a while.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? You're leaving? Where to?\"</p>, <p>Sir Tristan paused and looked back. Fiddling with the pocket watch in his pocket, he suddenly smiled.</p>, <p>\"To meet our reinforcements.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Ding—!</p>, <p>A chime rang in the air as Aoife and Evelyn stepped out of the bookstore. The two of them had been paired up together.</p>, <p>Coming out of the store, Aoife held onto several books. The pile was quite long, with Aoife having to hold the books with both hands.</p>, <p>The two quietly walked around the town before finding a place with a nice view to eat.</p>, <p>\"I'll have this.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Unlike Aoife, Evelyn took her time to choose her dish. Her eyes turned unusually serious as she scanned the menu.</p>, <p>Evelyn was taking so much time that Aoife felt compelled to say something.</p>, <p>\"Are you ordering anything?\"</p>, <p>\"I am.\"</p>, <p>\"It's been several minutes.\"</p>, <p>\"I know.\"</p>, <p>\".....So?\"</p>, <p>\"Quiet.\"</p>, <p>Aoife was taken aback. This was the first time she had seen Evelyn act that way. In fact, taking a look at her now, she seemed like a completely different person.</p>, <p>Even her aura appeared to be different.</p>, <p>What in the...</p>, <p>\"I'll have this one, please. I'd also like it for it to be accompanied with some Givvon Wine.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Aoife's expression turned even stranger. Givvon Wine? What the hell was that? Even though Aoife was a noble, she had never heard of such a type of wine. It sounded fancy.</p>, <p>Evelyn's response was cold.</p>, <p>\"I take my food seriously.\"</p>, <p>\".....I see.\"</p>, <p>The atmosphere turned awkward. But not for long as Evelyn shifted the attention towards the book on the table.</p>, <p>\"Food aside, what did you get?\"</p>, <p>Aoife had spent quite a bit of time searching for the books. Evelyn hadn't had the chance to check what she had bought.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right.\"</p>, <p>Aoife flipped one of the books open.</p>, <p>\"Besides study materials, I also got some information about the town. Since we're here on a mission, I thought it was appropriate to do so.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn grew somewhat curious. Taking a sip of her water, she leaned back, brushing her purple hair behind her ear.</p>, <p>\"What did you find out?\"</p>, <p>\"....Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned. Skimming through the book, she paused after a short while. Looking around, she lowered her voice to whisper,</p>, <p>\"A necromancer.\"</p>, <p> \"Eh...?!\"</p>, <p>Evelyn had to hastily cover her mouth to prevent herself from shouting. Thankfully, no one noticed her outburst as she apologized to Aoife.</p>, <p>\"Sorry.\"</p>, <p>\"....It's fine.\"</p>, <p>Taking a breath to calm herself down, Evelyn whispered back,</p>, <p>\"Did you say a necromancer?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Aoife nodded her head with a serious expression and flipped the book to a certain page.</p>, <p>\"According to the book, a necromancer has been haunting this city for over thirty years. Several raid parties had been sent by the town to fight against the necromancer, but unfortunately, they ended up in defeat every time. It's a powerful one.\"</p>, <p>\"Wait, did you say for over thirty years?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Aoife grimly nodded.</p>, <p>\"....Thirty years.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn stayed quiet for a short moment to digest the information. Then, once she did, she asked,</p>, <p>\"And they've never asked for help?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Aoife shook her head.</p>, <p>Despite being from the Megrail family, this was the first time she had heard of such a case. This either meant that the Megrail family ignored the situation, or the town had never asked for help from outsiders.</p>, <p>Aoife was leaning more towards the latter.</p>, <p>Especially since the Empire took Rogue Necromancers extremely seriously.</p>, <p>Belonging to the [Curse] category, these beings possessed the ability to revive the dead and control them as 'puppets'. While individually not powerful, their power lay in their ability to amass an army of these 'puppets', rendering them a significant threat.</p>, <p>Especially if they were given a lot of time to grow.</p>, <p>\".....What is this?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn rubbed her forehead in shock.</p>, <p>As a noble, she understood well just how powerful a necromancer was. For the town to not have reported such a dangerous entity for so long...</p>, <p>\"How strong is it now?\"</p>, <p>\"I don't know.\"</p>, <p>Aoife shook her head and closed the book.</p>, <p>\"However, if the Academy sent us, it means that we can handle it.\"</p>, <p>\"You think?\"</p>, <p>\".....Yes.\"</p>, <p>If the situation was serious, then her family would've already sent someone by now.</p>, <p>\"That's a relief.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn patted her chest in relief. Just then, her eyes paused on one of the other books on the table and her expression scrunched up slightly. Raising her head, she looked at Aoife weirdly.</p>, <p>\"Why do you have that?\"</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn pointed at the book in question.</p>, <p>\"That.\"</p>, <p>\".....Ah.\"</p>, <p>Aoife covered the book with her hand.</p>, <p>\"I wanted to cross reference some things. I have a similar book in English so I wanted to use it as a reference for when I'm learning.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn wasn't sure whether to believe her or not.</p>, <p>&lt;Fun Jokes that will make you laugh all day&gt;</p>, <p>\".....How is that supposed to help? Don't tell me you actuall-\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Rea-\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>In the end, Evelyn stopped caring. There was something else that was more important. Their food was here.</p>, <p>\"Here you go. Enjoy.\"</p>, <p>Immediately, a nice smell wafted through the air and Evelyn smacked her lips.</p>, <p>'Aroma. Nine out of ten. It's pleasing to the nose and isn't overbearing. It cuddles you like a warm blanket in winter.'</p>, <p>Picking up the fork, Evelyn was just about to dig into her food when she paused.</p>, <p>\"Hu?\"</p>, <p>Not far from where they were, she spotted two figures. The two were walking together without saying a thing.</p>, <p>It was an odd sight.</p>, <p>As if noticing her reaction, Aoife turned her head</p>, <p>\"What... Ah.\"</p>, <p>The moment her head turned and she took notice of the two, her head flicked back into place. It was almost as if she was avoiding them.</p>, <p>Wait, what?</p>, <p>Confused, Evelyn looked at Aoife. However, before she could get any words out, a shadow cast over the area they were in. It was none other than Leon.</p>, <p>\"Leon?\"</p>, <p>\"....Hello.\"</p>, <p>Looking behind him, Evelyn noticed that Julien was there as well. Looking at the river, he appeared to be lost in his own thoughts. It was a weird sight.</p>, <p>Turning her head, Aoife confronted Leon.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing here?\"</p>, <p>\"....I was wondering if you found anything.\"</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Squinting her eyes, Aoife's head briefly looked back and then she sighed. Opening one of the books, she started to recount everything that she had told Evelyn.</p>, <p>It took no longer than ten minutes and by the time she was done, Leon was staring back at her with a frown.</p>, <p>\"A necromancer?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\".....That's troublesome.\"</p>, <p>\"It is. Especially since we don't know how strong it is. However, judging from the initial scouts by the Academy, it doesn't seem like something we can't handle.\"</p>, <p>\"That's tr-\"</p>, <p>Leon paused halfway through his sentence as his gaze fell on a certain book on the table. In a flash, his head flicked back to Julien and then to the book.</p>, <p>His unusual actions attracted the curious looks of the girls.</p>, <p>\"What's wrong with you? Is-\"</p>, <p>\"This book.\"</p>, <p>Leon pointed at it while lowering his voice.</p>, <p>\"Why do you have this?\"</p>, <p>His gray eyes stared deeply into Aoife's. He almost seemed shaken.</p>, <p>\"Didn't I tell you it's cursed?\"</p>, <p>\"....Uh? When? I just bought this—hey what are you doing!\"</p>, <p>Splash—</p>, <p>Aoife's opened her eyes wide. By now, everyone's attention was on Leon who seemed like a totally different person.</p>, <p>\"What the hell was that for?!\"</p>, <p>Leon didn't appear all that bothered about Aoife's anger. Rather, he seemed relieved. But not for long.</p>, <p>Especially when he noticed Julien's gaze directed towards that crystal clear water.</p>, <p>His eyes seemed to be fixed on the cover of the book.</p>, <p>\".....Oh, no.\"</p>, <p>And for the first time in Evelyn's life, she witnessed Leon's expression crumble.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Time passed. It was now time for dinner. The day had passed in a flash, and before I knew it, we had to return to the rendevous point which was located in the hotel we were staying in.</p>, <p>It was a large building that stood out just as much as the casino.</p>, <p>The walls were adorned with paintings depicting all sorts of images, while rich wooden accents, from polished oak furniture to finely carved beams, added warmth to the ambiance.</p>, <p>\"....It's a pity that we weren't able to go to the casino.\"</p>, <p>\"Um.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded in agreement as we entered the building.</p>, <p>After the meeting with Aoife, we spent the better second half of our day looking into the situation.</p>, <p>If I had one word to describe it then it'd be 'grim'.</p>, <p>The situation was grim.</p>, <p>While the place looked joyful and happy on the outside, it was merely an outer facade.</p>, <p>A facade that they had created just for us.</p>, <p>\"Akh!! She's not here too?!\"</p>, <p>A sudden shout snapped me out of my thoughts. Looking towards where the sound came from, I noticed a haggard-</p>, <p>looking Josephine by the entrance of the hotel.</p>, <p>With sweat dripping down the corner of her face, she frantically looked around.</p>, <p>\"Oh, no... Oh, no...\"</p>, <p>Leon and I exchanged glances as we both grew serious.</p>, <p>Don't tell me...</p>, <p>\"What's going on?\"</p>, <p>Aoife was the first one to step up.</p>, <p>She too appeared equally serious. Probably, she also realized what we had found.</p>, <p>And the fact that the professors weren't here yet added to the tension.</p>, <p>\"Did something happen?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, this...! Aoife!\"</p>, <p>Josephine rubbed her hair in frustration and panic.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>The tension around the room elevated.</p>, <p>So much so that one other cadet urged from the back.</p>, <p>\"Spit it out? What is it?\"</p>, <p>\"It's Kiera!\"</p>, <p>Josephine said exasperatedly.</p>, <p>\"Kiera? What about her?\"</p>, <p>\"She... She went missing! I've been looking for her the entire day! She was meant to have gone to the bathroom, but she never came back. Oh no...! What if s-\"</p>, <p>Josephine stopped.</p>, <p>Blinking her eyes, she turned her head. In the distance, a figure appeared. Josephine blinked yet again to make sure she wasn't seeing things.</p>, <p>When she was sure it was indeed Kiera, her expression changed.</p>, <p>\"Enng?...Kiera?! Wait, why does she...? Nn?\"</p>, <p>\"That's...!\"</p>, <p>\"...?\"</p>, <p>Everyone's expressions changed the moment they looked in the same direction she was looking at.</p>, <p>\"What's going... Ah.\"</p>, <p>When I faced the direction they were looking at, I understood perfectly why their expressions were like that.</p>, <p>\"What is she doing?\"</p>, <p>No, more importantly.</p>, <p>Why was she dressed like that?</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>\"Yo~\"</p>, <p>Holding onto a big cigar, Kiera greeted all of us. Her nonchalant air mixed with the arrogant expression she was making stood out and people started to look her way.</p>, <p>It wasn't just her expression that stood out.</p>, <p>\"Where did you get that?\"</p>, <p>But the huge fur jacket that she was wearing as well. With black stripes across and the fact that it draped all the way down to her legs, she stood out amongst the crowd.</p>, <p>Coupled with a pair of sunglasses and a cigar, she looked like a pimp.</p>, <p>\"Oh? You mean this?\"</p>, <p>Kiera pinched and pulled on the coat.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>And took a drag of her cigar.</p>, <p>Smoke lingered around her face for a couple of seconds.</p>, <p>\"Nothing much. Just gambling and shit~\"</p>, <p>\"Gambling?\"</p>, <p>Josephine's eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"Wait, what?! You went gambling?!\"</p>, <p>I stared at the scene speechlessly.</p>, <p>Kiera nodded while putting her hand in her pocket.</p>, <p>\"No, for real. I went in there with all my money and...\"</p>, <p>She scratched the side of her face.</p>, <p>\"...I lost everything.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"But...!\"</p>, <p>She raised her finger. As if trying to justify that she had gambled all her money away.</p>, <p>\"I still managed to win myself this nice jacket! Made from real Belstron skin. Fucking awesome, right? Keke... Plus, I also got a free box of cigars. They're of good quality. Want to try one?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Josephine opened her mouth, but the word just refused to leave her.</p>, <p>Misunderstanding her actions, Kiera stuffed a cigar in her mouth.</p>, <p>\"....Ukeh!\"</p>, <p>\"There you go!\"</p>, <p>And lit it up with her finger.</p>, <p>\"Now take a big puff.\"</p>, <p>\"Cough...! Cough...! Akh! Why do my eyes burn?\"</p>, <p>\"Kakakaka.\"</p>, <p>Slapping her thigh, Kiera bent over and started to laugh.</p>, <p>\"Did you see the face you made?\"</p>, <p>\".....Akh!\"</p>, <p>From that point forward, everyone lost interest in what was happening. It was just the normal stuff.</p>, <p>That was until...</p>, <p>WHIIIII—</p>, <p>The large blaring sound of a horn echoed throughout the entire town.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>WHIII—</p>, <p>\"What's going on?\"</p>, <p>\"What's happening? What is this sound...?\"</p>, <p>The blaring sound of the horn echoed throughout the air. It was loud, and as if a spell had been cast on the entire town, the atmosphere drastically changed.</p>, <p>It suddenly became extremely tense.</p>, <p>Cli Cla—</p>, <p>The lights went out everywhere, and the shops closed, leaving everything deserted in an instant.</p>, <p>Just as we were wondering about what was going on, Professor Bridgette entered the reception with Professor Hollowe behind her. As compared to her, who had a grim expression, he seemed more relaxed.</p>, <p>\"Everyone, please calm down. There's no need to be tense.\"</p>, <p>Her calm voice seemed to have an effect on the cadets, gradually easing the previous spreading panic.</p>, <p>\".....I will let you know more of what's going on later. For now, please follow me. I would like for you to see what is happening for yourself.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette left shortly after that.</p>, <p>We followed her from behind.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak. Tak.</p>, <p>The only sound echoing within the town was the sound of our footsteps as we walked across the now-deserted streets.</p>, <p>It was a strange sight. Especially considering how different it was from the day.</p>, <p>\"....Wow, fuck.\"</p>, <p>Even Kiera appeared to be creeped out as she rubbed her chin against her fur jacket.</p>, <p>On the other hand, Leon walked beside me with the same look he always wore. Glancing at him, I couldn't tell whether he was concerned or not.</p>, <p>But it didn't matter.</p>, <p>Soon, we approached the city walls. Over a hundred guards greeted us near the stairs that led to the top, with a tall man in his forties taking the lead.</p>, <p>\"You are here.\"</p>, <p>He almost seemed relieved by our appearance as his stiff face relaxed, slightly.</p>, <p>I took a moment to take a good look at him. He wore light armor, and with blonde hair and blue eyes, he looked no different than a noble. With that said, despite his appearance, I couldn't associate him with a noble.</p>, <p>There was something about his demenour that was vastly different than that of a noble.</p>, <p>He was more 'wild', or better said, 'rough'.</p>, <p>\"Let me have a moment of your time.\"</p>, <p>Even his voice was rough, with his tone sounding rather deep. Clearing his throat, his sharp blue eyes scanned us.</p>, <p>\".....I've been told that you are the cream of the crop of our Empire.\"</p>, <p>He started off with a very obvious statement.</p>, <p>\"My name is Tristan Blackwood. I'm a Tier 3 knight and a proud citizen of Ellnor.\"</p>, <p>Pausing, his blue eyes paused on several of us.</p>, <p>I thought he was going to give us a stern lecture about us being young and reckless and all that, but I was wrong.</p>, <p>\"I understand that you look young, but I won't judge you for it. In fact, I am proud to know that our Empire has young people like you in our midst.\"</p>, <p>Rather, he started off by complimenting us.</p>, <p> As his eyes scanned us, his expression turned extremely grim.</p>, <p>\"With that being said, this will be no easy mission. In fact, I don't even know if I will be able to guarantee you your life. We have lost far too many people already. It's because of our stubbornness that the situation reached this level. And for that, I am truly sorry.\"</p>, <p>Bowing his head, he earnestly apologized.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>No one said a thing. I didn't as well. Especially when I noticed the expressions of the other knights behind him.</p>, <p>\"W-we... have suffered far too many losses to count. Everyone here, be it me, or the knights that you see behind you. We have all lost someone dear to us. And all of it is our fault.\"</p>, <p>They appeared to be pained. Some were even shaking.</p>, <p>\"For-\"</p>, <p>Growwllll—!</p>, <p>Just then, a loud growl echoed in the far distance, and the faces of the knights changed drastically.</p>, <p>The same was true for the captain who hastily turned his head.</p>, <p>\"Oh, no...\"</p>, <p>Without saying another word, he rushed up the stairs of the walls.</p>, <p>\"Follow procedures quickly! Close the gates!\"</p>, <p>WHIIII— WHIIII—</p>, <p>The horn sounded again, and the city gates began to close. Despite the suddenness of the situation, everything proceeded in an orderly manner, with all the knights following orders without a single problem.</p>, <p>As I looked around, Professor Hollowe's voice reached my ears.</p>, <p>\"Cadets, make your way up. Captain's orders.\"</p>, <p>Looking up, the Professor beckoned us with his hand. Exchanging glances with Leon for a brief moment, we climbed up the stairs of the wall.</p>, <p>The walls stood about eight meters high and were constructed from solid stone. As I ascended to the top, the first thing that caught my eye was the large ballistae stationed there.</p>, <p>With arrows stretching over several meters and pointed metal heads, they looked extremely intimidating.</p>, <p>But that wasn't what caught my attention.</p>, <p>\"Holy crap...\"</p>, <p>I stared off into the horizon. A large cluster of...</p>, <p>\"What in the world is that...?\"</p>, <p>Humans? Skeletons? No... It was hard to describe. However, the only thing I could think of at the moment was.</p>, <p>\"Zombies.\"</p>, <p>A large cluster of zombies.</p>, <p>Having overheard my mutter, Leon looked at me with a questionable look.</p>, <p>\"....Zombies?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah, zombies.\"</p>, <p>\"What is that?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? Ah, right.\"</p>, <p>Realization hit me not long after.</p>, <p>This wasn't a term used in this world.</p>, <p>I pointed at the monsters in the distance.</p>, <p>\"Well, whatever that is.\"</p>, <p>Their movements were slow, with some of them wearing armor resembling that of the guards at the top.</p>, <p>Staring at the numerous such creatures, I shuddered slightly. The scene looked straight out of a horror movie.</p>, <p>The creepiest part was that many of their bodies were preserved due to the cold, leaving their skin blue as a result.</p>, <p>Just as I locked eyes with one of the zombies in the distance, their mouths parted open as they began to shout.</p>, <p>Growwllll—!</p>, <p>Their sound pierced through the air. Behind them, the sun was beginning to sink toward the horizon, casting the sky in a gentle veil of orange.</p>, <p>With one scream, the zombies made themselves known.</p>, <p>\"Load the ballistae!\"</p>, <p>It took three knights to operate a ballista. But even that was a struggle as they let out strained \"Guoo—!\" shouts as they loaded up the arrows.</p>, <p>\"Shoot!\"</p>, <p>Xiiu! Xiuuu!! Xiu!</p>, <p>The air whistled as several enormous arrows shot forth, casting shadows on the land below. They streaked through the air and crashed into the hordes of zombies in the distance as a dust cloud formed.</p>, <p>Booom—!</p>, <p>Like bowling pins, the zombies scattered and flew everywhere.</p>, <p>\"Oh!!\"</p>, <p>\"It hit...!\"</p>, <p>The cadets threw their hands in the air in celebration the moment the arrow hit.</p>, <p>\"That was awesome!\"</p>, <p>However, looking around and taking in the grim expressions of the knights on the walls, I knew that things weren't as simple as they seemed.</p>, <p>And as expected.</p>, <p>They weren't.</p>, <p>\"Ah! They're getting back up!\"</p>, <p>\"What the...!\"</p>, <p>As if nothing had happened, the zombies regrouped from the ground and resumed their march forward. The creepiest part was when the zombies picked up their missing limbs and reattached them to themselves as if it were nothing.</p>, <p>Growwllll—!</p>, <p>I felt goosebumps staring at the scene.</p>, <p>This really did seem like a scene from a horror movie.</p>, <p>\"Reload the arrow! Reload the arrow! We need to hold them off until the sun rises again! They will leave right when the sun comes back up! Reload the arrows...!\"</p>, <p>Accompanying the captain's shout, I heard a new piece of information.</p>, <p>'So the zombies only come out at night, and they will stop during the day?'</p>, <p>Now this...</p>, <p>It really did sound like a game.</p>, <p>\"Don't falter! Keep reloading! This is just the start! You already know the drill!\"</p>, <p>\"Guooo—!\"</p>, <p>The knights reloaded the arrows and prepared for the second round.</p>, <p>Xiiu! Xiuuu!! Xiu!</p>, <p>A similar scene from before occurred. Enormous arrows shot forth from the ballistae, hurtling toward the large horde in the distance. Each arrow streaked through the air at incredible speeds before colliding directly with the horde.</p>, <p>But even so...</p>, <p>\"Again!\"</p>, <p>None...</p>, <p>\"Again!\"</p>, <p>Of the arrows...</p>, <p>\"Again!\"</p>, <p>Did a thing!</p>, <p>\"Again!\"</p>, <p>Xiuuuu—!</p>, <p>With each arrow shot, the knights grew increasingly fatigued. I could vividly observe this from where I stood. Sweat dripped down their faces, and their hands shook as they carried each arrow to the ballistae.</p>, <p>It was a tragic scene.</p>, <p>However, as if they were on some sort of drug, they continued to load the ballistae without letting out a single complaint.</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>Even as some of them fell over due to tiredness.</p>, <p>\"Quickly replace him! Go! Go! Go!\"</p>, <p>It was a grim scene.</p>, <p>One that made me realize just how gruesome each day had been for them.</p>, <p>'So they've been doing this every single day for thirty years...?'</p>, <p>It made one wonder just why people still chose to remain in this town. It wasn't as if the citizens couldn't run away. It was possible. So...</p>, <p>'What is keeping them from leaving?\"</p>, <p>\"Sir captain, let us do something.\"</p>, <p>\"At this rate, the soldiers won't be able to last much longer.\"</p>, <p>\"Is there a better way of doing this? Do they not have any weakness?\"</p>, <p>Snapping out of my thoughts, I turned to look to my right.A small circle had formed around the captain who had to halt his commands to look back at them.</p>, <p>It appeared as though some of the cadets could no longer take the scene they were seeing.</p>, <p>\"Let us help!\"</p>, <p>The captain dismissed them with a wave of his hand.</p>, <p>\"Later! Later! Your role will come later. As for weaknesses, they don't have any.\"</p>, <p>\"They don't?\"</p>, <p>I was the one who said that as Leon turned to look at me. Feeling his gaze, I sliced my neck with my hand.</p>, <p>\"Cutting their necks and stuff. That could work.\"</p>, <p>It worked in the movies.</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Leon tilted his head and looked at me with a gaze that seemed to say, 'Are you stupid?'. No, rather, I think he was just about to say that when I stopped him.</p>, <p>\"You still look stupid.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>He lowered his head with a frown.</p>, <p>Most probably, he was thinking about a comeback. I didn't let him.</p>, <p>\"So cutting necks doesn't work?\"</p>, <p>For a game, it sure didn't respect the main rules of zombies.</p>, <p>\"What works then?\"</p>, <p>\".....Killing the one behind all of this.\"</p>, <p>A voice interjected from behind us. When I turned to look, my gaze met with Aoife's. As the wind blew, scattering her red hair all over her face, she went on to say,</p>, <p>\"So long as the necromancer is alive, the undead will be able to revive infinitely.\"</p>, <p>Looking towards the hordes of zombies, Aoife frowned.</p>, <p>\"....And that's the problem. Nobody knows where the necromancer is. It's for that reason that they've been stuck in this stalemate for so long.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>It all clicked then.</p>, <p>\"So the problem is finding the necromancer...\"</p>, <p>\"Yes. From what I've managed to get, they've sent several search parties in hopes of finding it. Unfortunately, none ever came back, and those that did weren't able to find a thing.\"</p>, <p>\"....I see.\"</p>, <p>Moving toward the edge of the wall, I leaned slightly to get a good look at the zombies. Despite their slow speed and the barrage of arrows, they were steadily making progress, their numbers overwhelming.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>barrage of arrows, they were steadily making progress, their As the cold wind pierced my skin, I had a sudden thought.</p>, <p>Since it was possible for me to use the second leaf on people I killed...</p>, <p>\"Is it possible to use it on them...?\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>'....Is it possible?'</p>, <p>The idea seemed feasible. However, I wasn't sure if I could actually do it.</p>, <p>What if there was a limit to the second leaf? A limit that prevented me from using it on those who had died for far too long.</p>, <p>What then...?</p>, <p>Xiu! Xiu!</p>, <p>The thunderous echoes of ballistae firing resonated in the distance as I stood atop the city walls, gazing down at the unfolding spectacle below.</p>, <p>'The goal of this expedition is to find the necromancer. So far, in the thirty years that the attacks have started, they hadn't been able to find a single thing.'</p>, <p>Was the necromancer that hard to find?</p>, <p>....Or was it simply because they were too weak?</p>, <p>I turned my attention towards the knight's captain.</p>, <p>\"Reload! Reload!\"</p>, <p>\"Someone has fainted again! Replace them quickly! Reload!\"</p>, <p>He was barking out orders left and right as he ran around the entire walls. The organization amongst the knights was impeccable.</p>, <p>However, looking at their exhausted and haggard expressions, I could tell that they were on their last legs.</p>, <p>They were weak. Far too weak.</p>, <p>Even the knight captain was weak at only Tier 3. He was just about the same strength as us.</p>, <p>In fact,</p>, <p>I turned my head to look at Leon beside me.</p>, <p>'....This guy is probably stronger than the knight's captain.'</p>, <p>It was a bit of an odd realization.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>As if noticing my gaze, Leon flinched slightly. Yes, flinched.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>He stepped away too. Realization soon dawned on me and I sighed.</p>, <p>\"I'm not going to call you stupid.\"</p>, <p>There was a time and place for such a thing.</p>, <p>\"You won't?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>, <p>I calmly nodded to reassure him.</p>, <p>\"Your face does that for me.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I covered my mouth upon realizing what I had done. I was just about to apologize when...</p>, <p>\"They're coming! Second battalion move out!\"</p>, <p> The loud shout of the knight's captain echoed throughout. Finally turning his attention towards us, he pointed towards the horde of zombies who had nearly reached the perimeter of the walls.</p>, <p>\"Cadets! Help out the second battalion! Please help us control and manage the undead!\"</p>, <p>Growwllll—!</p>, <p>\"Wh, what...!? We're fighting now?\"</p>, <p>The cadets were astonished by the sudden command.</p>, <p>At the same time, the gates beneath opened, and a group of over a hundred knights charged forward.</p>, <p>\"Fight!!\"</p>, <p>\"Uwoooo—!\"</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>Sparks instantly flew in the air the moment the two sides clashed. What was most shocking was the fact that the zombies were able to keep themselves upright as their flesh remained intact.</p>, <p>It was as if their skin was made out of metal.</p>, <p>\"The hell...\"</p>, <p>Besides me, Kiera watched the scene with astonishment.</p>, <p>\"What are these things even made out of? Not only are they immortal, but their skin is also as tough as metal. What kind of...\"</p>, <p>\"Don't worry about that now. Attack first.\"</p>, <p>Aoife stood on top of the wall.</p>, <p>As her red hair fluttered, she extended her hand forward.</p>, <p>Her expression quickly distorted as she focused her attention on the horde of zombies beneath.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>A groan escaped her small lips as over a dozen zombies clamped up together.</p>, <p>\"What the...?\"</p>, <p>\"What's going on? Ah!\"</p>, <p>The Knights, who had been in an intense fight with the zombies, halted for a brief moment as they noticed the zombies suddenly freezing on the spot and moving back.</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>Shortly after that, a figure jumped down from the wall.</p>, <p>It was Leon.</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>Softly landing on the ground, his sword glowed, illuminating the surroundings. Stomping his foot on the ground, he slashed.</p>, <p>SHIIIIING—!</p>, <p>His sword drew a beautiful arc in the air. At the same time that he slashed, Aoife compressed her hands together, clumping up even more zombies together.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>The impact of his attack and the zombies resonated loudly in the air, the sound mimicking that of a bat hitting against hard steel.</p>, <p>It resounded throughout the air and spread throughout.</p>, <p>\"Did it work?\"</p>, <p>\"Look! It worked!\"</p>, <p>When all was said and done, over a hundred zombies scattered across the ground with their bodies cut in half.</p>, <p>Just as everyone was about to rejoice, a shocking scene occurred.</p>, <p>\"Ah...!\"</p>, <p>\"They're getting back up!\"</p>, <p>\"What the hell is this...?!\"</p>, <p>Indeed, it was just as they said. Seconds after Leon's attack, a purple glow basked over the zombies, forcing their bodies back together.</p>, <p>Groooowl—!</p>, <p>Getting back up, they stood up and proceeded to head for the walls. It was as if Leon's and Aoife's combined effort had done nothing.</p>, <p>\"Fuck, even that didn't work?\"</p>, <p>\"Just how sturdy are these zombies?\"</p>, <p>Kiera and Josephine shouted from the walls with incredulous looks.</p>, <p>Not far from them, the other cadets stared at the scene with a little apprehension. They were probably intimidated by what they had seen.</p>, <p>One could say that Kiera's personality was handy on these types of occasions.</p>, <p>\".....Get the fuck out! Let me try!\"</p>, <p>Jumping out of the wall, two orange magic circles floated on each of her palms. The mana condensed to her side as she pushed her hands forward.</p>, <p>Swoooo—!</p>, <p>The world illuminated as brilliant flames shone. They spread throughout, engulfing the incoming zombies like an avalanche of fire.</p>, <p>I stared at the flames that lit up the world for a brief moment.</p>, <p>They were gorgeous.</p>, <p>But even they had no effect in the end.</p>, <p>\"What the hell?!\"</p>, <p>This time, even Kiera was at a loss for words.</p>, <p>Given the power of her flames, I also thought she'd at least do something, but in the end, the zombies appeared completely unharmed, walking out of the flames at the same speed.</p>, <p>\"Get back! Get back!\"</p>, <p>The commander's voice reached us from beside us. His face was pale, and sweat continuously dripped down his face as he ran around the walls giving orders.</p>, <p>\"Hold the undead back!\"</p>, <p>\"Prevent them from entering the city! Stop them at all costs!\"</p>, <p>\"Cadets! Conserve your mana! Just try your best to hold the undead back! Try to resist until the sun comes up! There is no use going all out against them!\"</p>, <p>Stopping, he waved his hand.</p>, <p>\"Fire!!\"</p>, <p>Xiu! Xiu—!</p>, <p>The arrows shot forth.</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>Alongside each arrow, a soldier would fall from exhaustion. They'd quickly be replaced by another soldier who carried on their burden.</p>, <p>\"Fire!\"</p>, <p>Xiu! Xiu—!</p>, <p>I stared at the scene unblinkingly.</p>, <p>\"....Hey, what are you doing?!\"</p>, <p>Before I knew it, I was standing on top of the walls of the town. My body was still in terrible condition, and Aoife was tugging at my clothes from behind.</p>, <p>\"Are you going to try something too? Didn't you hear the captain's words? We need to contain them. Leon's and my attacks combined had no effect. We sho-\"</p>, <p>\"....No.\"</p>, <p>I shook my head while staring at the zombies beneath. The number seemed endless. They stretched for as long as the eye could see, and they were all headed towards the town.</p>, <p>For what reason?</p>, <p>I wasn't sure.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Extending my hand, a thread flew out. My core burned at the usage of mana, but I didn't mind the pain and watched as one of the threads circled around one of the zombies's necks.</p>, <p>Making sure it was all secured, I pulled with my hand, flinging the zombie in my direction.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing...! Are you crazy!?\"</p>, <p>Aoife's surprised voice echoed from beside me.</p>, <p>I ignored it and opened up my palm.</p>, <p>Plak—!</p>, <p>Closing my palm and grasping its neck, I stared at its hollow eyes and pale skin.</p>, <p>Groowlll—!</p>, <p>It squirmed under my grasp. But I kept my grip form. Staring at it for a good moment, I activated the second leaf.</p>, <p>My world turned dark.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>The sun shone brightly.</p>, <p>A group of four stood before the city walls. They stood tall, and towered over the surroundings.</p>, <p>Before them was a young teen. He looked familiar.</p>, <p>'Where have I seen him...?'</p>, <p>\"Are you all ready?\"</p>, <p>Ah.</p>, <p>It was his voice that gave it away. It was young, but it was also familiar.</p>, <p>'The captain.'</p>, <p>The young teen in front was Captain Travis.</p>, <p>....So this was from decades ago.</p>, <p>\"We are ready!\"</p>, <p>They looked nervous, but they held conviction as they stared into the distance. A burly man pounded his chest.</p>, <p>\"Do not worry. We will come back and avenge our fallen comrades.\"</p>, <p>\"That's right!\"</p>, <p>They were young, and they were brave. The group of four seemed to be just a little bit older than the captain.</p>, <p>\"Travis. Make sure you stay here. We will be back before you know it. With your sister too. You don't need to worry about our safety. We are the best knights in the village. You know of our abilities.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The young boy nodded his head.</p>, <p>\"....Okay.\"</p>, <p>He appeared to be hopeful.</p>, <p>And with such thought, he brought his hand towards his forehead in a salute. His back stood straight.</p>, <p>\"Subjugation force number twenty-seven. I wish you all the best of luck!\"</p>, <p>The four saluted back.</p>, <p>\"Subjugation force number twenty-seven will be departing!\"</p>, <p>\"Subjugation force number twenty-seven will be departing!\"</p>, <p>\"Subjugation force number twenty-seven will be departing!\"</p>, <p>\"Subjugation force number twenty-seven will be departing!\"</p>, <p>The quartet embarked on their journey, striding forward along the road. I trailed behind, content to observe their progress from a distance.</p>, <p>\"Let's do this!\"</p>, <p>\".....Let's avenge our predecessors. With our strength, we will defeat that darned necromancer.\"</p>, <p>They were all smiles along the way. They, who had been stuck in their town for their entire life, were finally on an adventure.</p>, <p>Along with the nervousness, was a strange sense of excitement.</p>, <p>I watched them laugh.</p>, <p>I watched them struggle.</p>, <p>I watched them help each other.</p>, <p>And I watched them bask in the sceneries that their adventures brought them.</p>, <p>\"Amazing...!\"</p>, <p>\"Wait until we return and tell Travis about our journey. He'll be so jealous.\"</p>, <p>Amidst the struggle was a joy that one couldn't explain. But I felt it all as I followed them from behind.</p>, <p>The journey was a long one. I didn't know for how long they had walked. However, the scenes around all made up for it.</p>, <p>From waterfalls to rivers to rocky surfaces.</p>, <p>It was a breathtaking sight.</p>, <p>Sights that I wasn't able to enjoy for much longer as a large dome of purple appeared in the distance.</p>, <p>\"What's this!?\"</p>, <p>\"The necromancer!\"</p>, <p>Within the dome, a veiled figure stood. The moment I laid my eyes on it, I felt a sense of oppression coming from it.</p>, <p>\"Ah...!\"</p>, <p>\"That!\"</p>, <p>But it wasn't the necromancer's appearance that startled the group of four.</p>, <p>No, it was...</p>, <p>\"Mom!\"</p>, <p>\"....D-dad! I see them again!\"</p>, <p>The numerous figures that stood in front of the necromancer. Each one of them, they were a figure that the group was familiar with.</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 1. [Anger] EXP + 0.2%</p>, <p>I felt their anger.</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 2. [Sadness] EXP + 0.4%</p>, <p>But I also felt their sadness.</p>, <p>\"Attack...!\"</p>, <p>The group of four charged. Their target was none other than the necromancer. With their weapons drawn, they attacked.</p>, <p>\"Ahhhh—!\" That was the last thing I saw before the world turned black. That was when I understood.</p>, <p>Their journey. The one that I had followed from behind.</p>, <p>It had come to an end.</p>, <p>\"Julien!\"</p>, <p>When I snapped out of it, I found myself in a familiar environment.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing with that thing?! Have you lost it!\"</p>, <p>Aoife's voice was still echoing from behind me.</p>, <p>Groowlll—! In my grasp, the zombie struggled. I stared at it again. This time, an image overlapped with the zombie in my grasp.</p>, <p>It looked much younger and had a smile on its face.</p>, <p>Groowlll—! Opening up my palm, I let go of the zombie and flung it back into the distance.</p>, <p>As I did, I stared at the numerous zombies that were approaching.</p>, <p>\"Thirty years.\"</p>, <p>For thirty years, this town; Ellnor, had sent its best knights to fight against the necromancer.</p>, <p>For thirty years, they failed.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Yes.</p>, <p>These thousands of zombies in front of me.</p>, <p>They were an accumulation of the thirty years of fallen soldiers who had died trying to fight the necromancer.</p>, <p>They...</p>, <p>Were the brutal reality behind the smiles of the citizens.</p>]\n",

We're almost there!\"</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>One by one, soldiers dropped down to the ground due to exhaustion.</p>, <p>\"Keep going! Just a little longer!\"</p>, <p>The captain's voice continued to echo throughout. He appeared to be the most tired of them all, but by sheer willpower, he kept himself standing as he continued to bark orders.</p>, <p>Clank—! Clank—!</p>, <p>The knights below were also on their last legs, struggling to contain the zombies.</p>, <p>\"Akh…!\"</p>, <p>And so were the cadets who, despite their strength, were also struggling.</p>, <p>It made sense when considering the fact that the zombies were immortal.</p>, <p>It also made one wonder how this town had managed to stay afloat with just one tier 3 knight.</p>, <p>It was most probably their ballistae and organization.</p>, <p>\"One more minute!\"</p>, <p>I also helped out here and there. Using the threads, I contained and pushed many zombies back.</p>, <p>I thought about keeping them separate, but the mana exertion was too much. In the end, the only thing I could do was push them back.</p>, <p>'….If only I wasn't injured.'</p>, <p>I felt a stinging pain each time that I used my mana. While I didn't mind the pain, I could notice it sharpening with each minute that I circulated my mana.</p>, <p>That wasn't good.</p>, <p>'I'm at risk of worsening my injuries.'</p>, <p>It was for that reason that I paced myself, unlike the others.</p>, <p>SHIIIING—!</p>, <p>Especially Leon and Aoife, who were practically drenched in their own sweat.</p>, <p>\"Haaa… haaa…\"</p>, <p>Standing beside me, I could hear just how labored Aoife's breath was as she utilized her powers to create an invisible wall, blocking the zombies from advancing.</p>, <p>It had to be said. Just the two alone were of great help.</p>, <p>On the other hand…</p>, <p>Woooom—!</p>, <p>\"Fuck!!! Why is my fire not doing anything!!?\"</p>, <p>Keira's performance was not great. It wasn't because she wasn't trying or anything like that.</p>, <p>But it mostly came down to the fact that the zombies were fire-resistant. Whenever the flames swept, nothing would happen.</p>, <p>Kracka! Kracka!</p>, <p>Evelyn on the other hand was faring much better. Using her skills, she was able to contain quite a few zombies.</p>, <p> \"Haaa… haaa… D-do something…\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Turning my head, I locked eyes with Aofie. Breathing laboriously, she tiredly nudged at the zombies with her chin.</p>, <p>\"Y-you can do more than this… D-\"</p>, <p>\"There's no need.\"</p>, <p>I cut her off.</p>, <p>\"It's time.\"</p>, <p>\"...U-h?\"</p>, <p>Staring at the horizon, the plain began to be shrouded in a veil of orange, blanketing over the region and the horde of zombies.</p>, <p>The sun had started to set.</p>, <p>And following its appearance the zombies's movements started to slow down.</p>, <p>\"It's over!\"</p>, <p>It was one of the soldiers who shouted that. And as if his words had an effect, all the zombies magically stopped moving.</p>, <p>\"It's over…?\"</p>, <p>\"Haaa… haaaa…. We can finally rest now?\"</p>, <p>Everyone was exhausted. Be it the cadets, and the knights. Nobody could hardly lift up a finger.</p>, <p>Even Leon, who usually seemed expressionless, showed a reaction as he stared at the frozen zombies.</p>, <p>Wiping the sweat from the side of his face, he walked closer to one of the zombies to get a closer look.</p>, <p>But just as he took a step, something happened.</p>, <p>\"Look—!\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, as a cadet pointed toward the zombies, I watched stupefied as a purple glow enveloped the zombies completely. I felt a familiar sense of oppression coming from the purple veil as it covered the zombies.</p>, <p>Before anyone could say or do a thing, the zombies faded.</p>, <p>\"What…!\"</p>, <p>\"Did they just vanish?\"</p>, <p>Unsurprisingly, the cadets were astonished by the development.</p>, <p>The same couldn't be said for the soldiers who slumped down on the walls tired.</p>, <p>\"Treat the injured!\"</p>, <p>\"Count the casualties!\"</p>, <p>The only one who didn't rest was the captain, who hurriedly moved around to check on every single person on the wall.</p>, <p>I stopped for a moment to stare at him.</p>, <p>The image of his younger self overlapped with his current image.</p>, <p>'He's no different than he is in my memories.'</p>, <p>Always prioritizes others over himself.</p>, <p>…But for him to have been at this for so long.</p>, <p>Just where did he get the willpower from?</p>, <p>'Is it from the constant deaths of his comrades? Or his drive to keep the people of this town safe?'</p>, <p>The more I looked at him, the more curious I became.</p>, <p>'Should I use my ability on him?'</p>, <p>My thoughts were stopped by the sudden appearance of the professors in the distance.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>They had unusually serious expressions.</p>, <p>'Now that I think about it, I haven't seen them the entire time.'</p>, <p>Where exactly had they gone?</p>, <p>I didn't need to wait for long to know the answer. Stopping before the Knight's captain, Professor Hollowe was the first one to speak.</p>, <p>\"…We weren't able to fully trace the mana surrounding the undead. We managed to get a wisp of it, but as of yet, we still haven't locked onto it yet. We will need a few more days to fully lock into them.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, I see.\"</p>, <p>The captain nodded his head in understanding.</p>, <p>\".....You can take your time. We've managed to hold on for so long. We have enough patience.\"</p>, <p>Realization dawned on me as I overheard their conversation.</p>, <p>'So they were tracking the necromancer.'</p>, <p>Indeed, all subjugation squads had died before returning to the town.</p>, <p>They still didn't know the location of it. But the same couldn't be said for me.</p>, <p>'I know where it is.'</p>, <p>I had seen it in my memories. In fact, I could even go right now.</p>, <p>But…</p>, <p>'No, not yet.'</p>, <p>I looked at my hands. They were shaking slightly. It was obvious that my body was still suffering from the after-effects of the drug.</p>, <p>I would be of no use if I were to go there. In fact, I'd be putting myself in danger.</p>, <p>Looking around, and seeing the exhausted looks on the cadets and the soldiers, I kept my mouth sealed.</p>, <p>It wasn't that I didn't want to tell them where it was. Not that such an option was possible since I couldn't just go up to them and say, 'Oh, I know where it is. Follow me.'</p>, <p>I'd have to explain myself.</p>, <p>....And there was a real possibility of my ability getting exposed.</p>, <p>I didn't want that to happen.</p>, <p>Not when the situation was still in control.</p>, <p>Since that was the case, I planned on letting things flow for as long as possible.</p>, <p>\"Right, for at least until I can heal up.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>I remained faithful to my words. For the next several days, I remained quiet and let the professors figure out the location of the necromancer.</p>, <p>Every sunset, at the same time, zombies would appear from the horizon.</p>, <p>Grooowlll—!</p>, <p>And every sunset, the knights, alongside the cadets, battled against the horde of incoming zombies.</p>, <p>\"Fire!\"</p>, <p>Xiu! Xiu!</p>, <p>\"Open the gates! Cadets!\"</p>, <p>Clank, Clank—</p>, <p>The scene from the first day repeated. It would first start with the rain of arrows from the ballistae. Then, when the zombies reached a certain distance, the cadets and knights would charge forward to repel their attacks.</p>, <p>This went on for several days, and by the time it was the fourth day, finally, the Professor managed to trace the mana locked onto the zombies.</p>, <p>\"I've gotten a trace!\"</p>, <p>A meeting took place shortly after that.</p>, <p>The meeting took place in the knight's headquarters. In a fairly large space, the knights and cadets gathered around a large dimly lit wooden table.</p>, <p>\".....The location is quite far from here.\"</p>, <p>Professor Hollowe was the one to speak. With his usual laidback expression, he unfurled a map and placed it on the desk.</p>, <p>\"The journey will probably take one or two days. Even now, I am unsure of how the necromancer is capable of controlling so many undead from such a distance. We will only find out once we get there,\"</p>, <p>Professor Hollowe explained. Taking out a pen, he circled a large area over the map.</p>, <p>\"My detection skills tell me that the necromancer is over around this area.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>Coming closer, the Knight's Captain frowned.</p>, <p>\"That's quite a large area. Not just two days, it might take you more. If you're planning on going on an expedition and taking the cadets with you, then I'm not sure if we'll be able to last much longer. The reason we've asked for reinforcements is because we can no longer hold on.\"</p>, <p>\"There's no need to worry about that.\"</p>, <p>Professor Hollowe reassured as he looked towards Professor Bridgette.</p>, <p>\"She, alongside several other cadets will remain here. On the other hand, I will go and check out the area alongside a few elite cadets.\"</p>, <p>\"That's...\"</p>, <p>Before the Captain could say a thing, Professor Hollowe placed his palm over the map.</p>, <p>\"I've already made my decision. With Professor Bridgette here, you won't have to worry about anything bad happening to the town.\"</p>, <p>He wasn't wrong there.</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette was a Tier 4 mage. Besides Professor Hollowe, whose strength I didn't know, she was by far the strongest.</p>, <p>In fact, she alone could handle a large portion of the incoming zombies.</p>, <p>The reason why she and the Professor hadn't intervened over the past few days was probably because they were trying to provide us with some real-life experience.</p>, <p>At least, that was my guess.</p>, <p>It became apparent to me when the two would intervene when certain cadets were placed in difficult spots. It made sense when one thought about it. We were the elites of the Empire. The loss of a single cadet was big.</p>, <p>Other than that, the two were also busy tracking down the necromancer.</p>, <p>\"Now then. Regarding the teams. I've already made up a list of the cadets that I will bring with me.\"</p>, <p>The air around the room changed as the Professor's gaze swept the room. For a brief moment, his gaze paused on me.</p>, <p>'This is the second time.'</p>, <p>I knew it from before, but he wanted something from me.</p>, <p>What exactly...?</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus.\"</p>, <p>My name was called up expectantly.</p>, <p>\"Leon Ellert.\"</p>, <p>And so were the rest of the members.</p>, <p>\"Aoife K. Megrail.\"</p>, <p>It was the strongest cadets of the year. Or those that performed the best during the past few days.</p>, <p>\"Kiera Mylne.\"</p>, <p>Even Kiera was called up. However, when thinking about it, she was of no use staying back and she probably knew it as she clicked her tongue.</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>Clap, Clap— Clapping twice, the Professor gathered our attention.</p>, <p>\".....Those whose names I've called please get ready. We will be departing in an hour Please get ready..\"</p>, <p>\"An hour?!\"</p>, <p>Kiera stood up in shock. Her face was still somewhat pale from the last wave.</p>, <p>\"We still haven't slept. How is this-\"</p>, <p>\"The time for sleep will come later. For now, get ready. It is currently daytime. We can't leave when the undead will come back.\"</p>, <p>\"But—\"</p>, <p>\"That's it. Meeting dismissed. If there is anything else we can talk about it later.\"</p>, <p>Standing up, Professor Hollowe proceeded to leave the meeting room.</p>, <p>\"No, wait! I—\"</p>, <p>Tracing his back with my eyes, I leaned back on my chair.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>Though I looked tired on the outside, my mind and body were fresh.</p>, <p>Unlike the other cadets, I didn't go all out. I rested my body and interfered occasionally. Just enough to make it seem like I was doing something.</p>, <p>I knew that something like this was going to happen.</p>, <p>\"Good thing I did.\"</p>, <p>Lifting my head to stare at the ceiling of the room, memories flashed in my mind. There were several. About nine.</p>, <p>They were memories of nine different people who took the same journey.</p>, <p>Sorting them out, I frowned.</p>, <p>'Something doesn't make sense.'</p>, <p>There was something about them that bothered me. However, I couldn't quite find the reason for this.</p>, <p>The memories...</p>, <p>They always ended right as they attacked the necromancer. But there was something about the necromancer that didn't make sense.</p>, <p>But what exactly was it?</p>, <p>I silently clenched and unclenched my fist.</p>, <p>\".....I guess I'll find out.\"</p>]\n",

Rather, I somewhat was starting to believe him.</p>, <p>But there was something that kept nagging me at the back of my mind.</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>\".....Why?\"</p>, <p>He raised his face to meet my gaze.</p>, <p>\"You speak as though you care so much about the people. So why? Why haven't you gone there yourself?\"</p>, <p>\"....Ah.\"</p>, <p>The captain's expression froze, and his lips trembled.</p>, <p>If before I could see anger and sadness, now I could see guilt. A lot of guilt.</p>, <p>\"T-that...\"</p>, <p>He didn't even seem to be capable of formulating his own sentences. It was as if something was eating at him.</p>, <p>But what...?</p>, <p>What exactly was that?</p>, <p>If that wasn't enough, there was something else that bothered me. Especially when I sorted through the memories I had looked through.</p>, <p>\"What about the first subjugation squad?\"</p>, <p>\"....T-the first? What about them?\"</p>, <p>The captain's reaction was all that I needed to know.</p>, <p>\"I've heard your sister participated in it.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes...\"</p>, <p>\"Were they also there to fight the necromancer? From what I-\"</p>, <p>\"Captain! Captain! We need your help!\"</p>, <p>Unfortunately, my words were cut short by a shout in the distance. The captain, who was called, found this opportunity to excuse himself.</p>, <p>\"....I can't thank you enough for your help. If you need any help, I'd be more than willing to offer it. But as you can see, I have to go now. If you would excuse me.\"</p>, <p>Those were his last words before he left.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence, staring at his departing back. Within the memories, I had seen him grow up. From a young boy, to a teenager, to a young male, to the middle-aged man that he was now.</p>, <p>Every time, he'd salute the subjugation squads as they left.</p>, <p>....And every time, he'd remain back in the town.</p>, <p>It had been a long time since he had become the strongest person in the town. And yet, people who were weaker than him had still been sent.</p>, <p>For what reason did he choose to remain here?</p>, <p>'Something doesn't add up.'</p>, <p>\"What are you doing...?\"</p>, <p>A sudden voice jolted me out of my thoughts. When I turned my head, I met eyes with Aoife and the rest of the members who were set to depart for the exploration.</p>, <p>\"I was just talking to the captain.\"</p>, <p>I answered, adjusting my backpack.</p>, <p>While I still felt that there was something odd about the captain, I didn't have anything to work with.</p>, <p>'Maybe, I'll find something out when I get closer to the necromancer.'</p>, <p>I was rather curious about it.</p>, <p>....Especially since it had something to do with [Curse] magic. Although it had only been in visions, I felt a strange sense of comfort in the purple dome that the necromancer was in.</p>, <p>I wanted to go there to make sure that what I had felt was real.</p>, <p>Perhaps...</p>, <p>I'd be able to find something that would help me grow my strength there.</p>, <p>'Hopefully, I won't have to learn necromancy.'</p>, <p>I wasn't really a fan of zombies.</p>, <p>\"Let's go. The Professor is waiting for us at the entrance.\"</p>, <p>\"Alright.\"</p>, <p>Nodding slightly, I followed the group from behind, walking alongside Leon who looked at me strangely.</p>, <p>\"Did you find anything?\"</p>, <p>\"....Not quite.\"</p>, <p>\"Not quite?\"</p>, <p>\"I don't have much to work with. For now, I just find the captain suspicious.\"</p>, <p>\"Suspicious?\"</p>, <p>Leon frowned, turning his head to stare at the captain in the distance. As his eyes locked onto him, his brows gradually rose.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>\"....What?\"</p>, <p>I looked at him in surprise.</p>, <p>\"Did you find something?\"</p>, <p>But how could that be? He had only just looked at him.</p>, <p>\"You're not wrong.\"</p>, <p>Leon eventually answered.</p>, <p>\".....He is hiding something. Or more like, the events seem to be centered around him. No, rather, the entire town?\"</p>, <p>He cocked his head.</p>, <p>\"It's difficult to tell. But he is hiding something.\"</p>, <p>\"What? How did...\"</p>, <p>\"I've got good instincts.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>What the hell is this guy on about...?</p>, <p>Was this something that main characters were just born with?</p>, <p>The worst part was that I couldn't even ask him about it since he probably wouldn't answer. So for that reason, I rubbed my forehead and asked,</p>, <p>\"How confident are you about your instincts?\"</p>, <p>\"They've never failed me before.\"</p>, <p>\"....I see.\"</p>, <p>I once again turned to look at the captain.</p>, <p>'So even Leon thinks that there's something off about him and his story...'</p>, <p>Since he felt like this, chances were that there was indeed something. However, despite knowing that, I decided to leave him alone and follow the group from behind.</p>, <p>So far, I still didn't have a lot of information.</p>, <p>I couldn't just confront him without reason. More than anything, I was more intrigued by the necromancer. Or the dome that was surrounding it.</p>, <p>.....There was something about it that I felt resonated with me.</p>, <p>\"Is everyone here?\"</p>, <p>As our group arrived at the entrance, greeting us there was Professor Hollowe who rubbed his eyes.</p>, <p>With a large backpack behind him, he blinked his eyes and did a short head count. Once he was sure that everyone was present, he turned around to face the town's gates.</p>, <p>\"Since everyone is here, let's prepare to depart. We don't have much time.\"</p>, <p>With light steps, he went ahead and crossed the gates.</p>, <p>The others followed shortly after him.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence for a short moment before taking a step forward and following them from behind.</p>, <p>Thinking about the large purple dome that awaited us in the distance, I knew that it wasn't going to be an easy trip.</p>, <p>That being said,</p>, <p>'I'm surprised I still didn't receive my quest window.'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>At the top of the town's walls.</p>, <p>A man stood solitary, staring at the departing group in the distance. Clenching onto the pocket watch and holding it closely to his chest, he repeatedly muttered the same words over and over again.</p>, <p>\"Sorry... Sorry... Sorry...\"</p>, <p>There was no one aside from him.</p>, <p>....And it was for this reason that he allowed the tears to stain his cheeks.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>\"Sorry... I want to go... Sorry... But I have to keep my promise...\"</p>, <p>The man was none other than the Knight's captain.</p>, <p>Holding onto his pocket watch, he bent over with exhaustion.</p>, <p>\"I promised...\"</p>, <p>And then, mustering every little bit of strength he had left, he brought his hand towards his forehead in a salute.</p>, <p>\"Subjugation force two hundred and fifty-five. I wish you all the best of luck!\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The journey was a quiet one.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Besides Josephine and Kiera who would bicker from time to time, and Professor Hollowe, who would occasionally talk, nobody said a word as we tracked forward.</p>, <p>I preferred for it to be that way.</p>, <p>Staring at the familiar environment, I couldn't help but pause on certain occasions. It wasn't that I wanted to pause, but every time I would see a familiar spot, images would flash across my mind.</p>, <p>'....Do you think we'll be able to make it back?'</p>, <p>The images were followed by their conversations.</p>, <p>'We will. I'm sure of it. Even if we don't, we should at least try something to help out those that will come in the future.'</p>, <p>'Woooow! I suddenly feel energized. That sleep sure did help! Haha, now that we don't have to constantly fight the undead, we can feel energized again.'</p>, <p>'Let's go.'</p>, <p>I saw countless memories and countless people.</p>, <p>Walking along the familiar path, their images would appear whenever I reached a familiar spot, reminding me of the history that this path had.</p>, <p>'Hehe! It's my birthday today. I'm turning fifteen.\"</p>, <p>'Happy birthday! Let's celebrate your birthday now. Once we return, we will make sure to celebrate it with everyone.'</p>, <p>'Hehe.'</p>, <p>Wherever I walked, familiar faces would show up.</p>, <p>I had never physically crossed this path before, but it felt as if I had crossed it several dozen times. All with different people.</p>, <p>'I've decided. When we get back, I'm going to propose to Emily!'</p>, <p>'Hahaha. You only have the guts to say this now because we're on a journey. You were scared shitless the last time you even saw her.'</p>, <p>'Bah!'</p>, <p>From laughs to tears...</p>, <p>I had seen and experienced them all.</p>, <p>Immersed in the memories, I didn't realize that it was already dark.</p>, <p>\"Let's stop here for the day.\"</p>, <p>What brought me out of the memories was the Professor's voice as he came to a stop. Within the rocky region, we found ourselves in a flat piece of land. The perfect place to set up camp.</p>, <p>\"Let's set up our tents and start a fire. We will resume our journey tomorrow morning. We aren't far from the destination.\"</p>, <p>I turned to look back in the direction of where we came from.</p>, <p>'They're probably fighting against the horde by now, right?'</p>, <p>Given the time, it made sense. I was sort of glad that I joined the exploration group. This was especially true since it meant that I could rest even more.</p>, <p>\"Alright.\"</p>, <p>Stretching my body, I started to help out the other cadets as we started to set up camp. Thankfully, the process wasn't hard. Within ten minutes, the tents were set up and a fire lit up in the middle.</p>, <p>On top of it was a pot where our food was cooking.</p>, <p>Crackle! Crackle!</p>, <p>A strange silence suddenly took over the group as all eyes fell on the fire burning in the middle.</p>, <p>The silence, however, was broken by the Professor who stirred the pot with a spoon.</p>, <p>\"I keep a photo of my wife and my kids in my wallet.\"</p>, <p>Everyone looked up at him as he stared at the fire.</p>, <p>I did too.</p>, <p>Suddenly, I felt like he was going to speak about himself to break the silence, but...</p>, <p>\"I use it as a reminder as to why I never have money.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"No? No one?...And here I was trying to liven up the mood.\"</p>, <p>Stirring the pot, Professor Hollowe muttered,</p>, <p>\"Tough crowd.\"</p>, <p>The previous silence that took over the group returned. This time, it felt strangely tense as the expressions of all the cadets turned weird.</p>, <p>This was especially so for Leon who looked at me.</p>, <p>His face... It looked extremely strained.</p>, <p>\"He.\"</p>, <p>Amidst the silence that took over the camp, I found myself covering my mouth.</p>, <p>As all eyes fell on me, my chest trembled. Leon looked at me with widened eyes as he shook his head.</p>, <p>It was as if he was saying, 'No, don't...!'</p>, <p>But it only made things worse.</p>, <p>Clenching onto my shirt,</p>, <p>\"Hehe.\"</p>, <p>I burst out laughing.</p>, <p>And the previous tension that lingered within me vanished.</p>]\n",
