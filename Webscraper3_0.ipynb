            "[<p>[Hidden Ending Perk!]</p>, <p>[The hidden class, &lt;Mage Gazing into the Abyss&gt; has been unlocked.]</p>, <p>A dry message appeared on the monitor.</p>, <p>“Ugh…”</p>, <p>I did it!</p>, <p>“A hidden class! You did it, Kim Shin-hwa!”</p>, <p>[Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>This is the game I’ve dedicated over 1,000 hours to recently.</p>, <p>[Cthulhu World] is a game set in modern Korea, incorporating elements of the Cthulhu mythos like the “Mountains of Madness” “Dagons” and “Nyarlathotep”.</p>, <p>Therefore, everything in this game existed in a way that was more grim and horrifying than reality.</p>, <p>The civilizations built by humanity were nothing more than sand castles, prone to collapse at any moment in the face of cosmic evil.</p>, <p>Humanity’s feeble minds and frail bodies became prey for surreal otherworldly beings.</p>, <p>Knowledge and wisdom turned into curses that spurred destruction.</p>, <p>Corrupted religions praised blasphemous wisdom. ,</p>, <p>Blind science studied forbidden knowledge.</p>, <p>The only weapon bestowed upon humanity was a veil called “ignorance”.</p>, <p>Even that was pitifully thin and frail to hold back beings that were indescribably enormous.</p>, <p>What is it like? Does it look fun?</p>, <p>Regardless of what others think, I find it to be fun.</p>, <p>Its unique settings and ambiance perfectly targeted my love for horror.</p>, <p>But the intrigue didn’t stop there.</p>, <p>True to its cosmic horror theme, the game was really, truly, genuinely very difficult.</p>, <p>The extreme difficulty, the horrifying traps, the powerful boss monsters that made you wonder if they were actually impossible to defeat, and the named NPCs hunting down players.</p>, <p>Of course, to a hardcore player like me, who had conquered all sorts of games, this was merely a stimulating challenge.</p>, <p>This time too, I had managed to clear an incredibly tough hidden ending and, as a reward, obtained a hidden class.</p>, <p>But still…</p>, <p><em>There’s no one to brag about it to… It’s really sad…</em></p>, <p>Out of curiosity, I checked the community, but all the posts from the last year were mine.</p>, <p>The view counts were all the same: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1…</p>, <p>In the past, there was at least some exchange of information, but lately, the community has become completely inactive.</p>, <p>Yes, that was the case.</p>, <p>This game was a flop.</p>, <p>It was so blatantly a failure that it couldn’t fool anyone.</p>, <p>The extreme settings, dark atmosphere, and hellish difficulty level…</p>, <p>Although these elements are divisive, they were not the cause of the game’s downfall.</p>, <p>The reason this game failed was due to its excessive bugs.</p>, <p>Getting stuck between structures or walking through walls was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>, <p>When the game suddenly crashes or a well-developed character disappears, who would want to play it?</p>, <p>Then there were the half-baked, unfinished elements that were glaringly obvious.</p>, <p>A prime example was the [Lacrex Codex], one of the items that must be obtained in every playthrough.</p>, <p>In the Cthulhu mythos, such tomes usually contain surreal wisdom or madness.</p>, <p>If it didn’t have a special function, at the very least, it should have been connected to some event.</p>, <p>But the [Lacrex Codex], despite its grandiose special effects, had no content written in it. There were no connected events either.</p>, <p>I wondered if Lacrex was a place or a person’s name, but such a word didn’t exist anywhere in the [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>What could it be then?</p>, <p>Either it was left unfinished, or the developers forgot about it halfway through!</p>, <p>Given these circumstances, the game was inevitably abandoned by its players.</p>, <p>I might be the only person who played it this far.</p>, <p><em>No, I am definitely the only one!</em></p>, <p>If there were actually other players, there would have been at least one post posted in the community.</p>, <p>Did everyone just not like Cthulhu or cosmic horror?</p>, <p>How could you hope to save the world from such mythological beings with such weak spirit!</p>, <p>Anyway, if one could adapt to the initial discomfort and absurd difficulty, it was somewhat fun.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, I quickly adapted to the numerous bugs.</p>, <p>Even though it was terrible, if you just thought, ‘Ah, it’s just a hidden piece, right?’ and got by, eventually you could even master the exploitation of bugs.</p>, <p>In fact, there were quite a few ridiculous bugs that actually helped with progress.</p>, <p><em>I shouldn’t have gotten used to such a game…</em></p>, <p>Ah, forget it, forget it.</p>, <p>Why is being recognized by others so important? Protecting the world from the dreadful Cthulhu is what matters!</p>, <p>Speaking of which…</p>, <p>“This time, it’s about unlocking a new character.”</p>, <p>Cthulhu World has a multi-ending system with over hundreds of endings.</p>, <p>The joy of experiencing new developments and stories with each route is one thing, but with each new ending viewed, small rewards were provided or hidden elements were unlocked.</p>, <p>If it’s a flop, at least make it interesting…</p>, <p>Thanks to these varied rewards and hidden elements, I never got tired of clinging to this game for so long.</p>, <p>“Since I’ve received it, shall I play with this one this time? I was thinking of trying a mage next, and if it’s a hidden class, it must have good options, right?”</p>, <p>Depending on what character you create, you could have a completely different experience in the game.</p>, <p>The character I had been playing just recently was a martial artist with the ability to transform into a beast.</p>, <p>A tough body that can withstand being shot by a gun when buffed!</p>, <p>He possessed immense strength, enough to hurl boulders!</p>, <p>Though he had no magical abilities at all, the storyline of overcoming all obstacles with sheer strength and brute force was incredibly fun.</p>, <p>This time, I decided to create a character that was the exact opposite extreme.</p>, <p>A mage with the very attractive “Hidden” title.</p>, <p>I clicked on [New Game] on the title screen and opened the character creation window.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>[Mage Gazing into the Abyss]</p>, <p>A mad mage researching the forbidden abyss of humanity.</p>, <p>The abyss is a living monster in itself.</p>, <p>He could wield evil magic capable of destroying even his own sanity.</p>, <p>But his soul, filled with madness and chaos, would be the perfect feast for the beings of the abyss.</p>, <p>Exclusive traits: [Shattered Mind], [Madness of the Abyss], [Feast Offering], [Supreme Stat Adjustment], [Abyss Magic], [Madman’s Luck], [Magic Devourer], [Spell Mastery], [Spell Enhancement: Deadly Poison]…</p>, <p>[Shattered Mind]: Randomly receives 2 mental illnesses. If, for any reason, this mental illness appears, you will randomly receive a new mental illness. The delirium effects caused by this acquired mental illness cannot be prevented.</p>, <p>/ You have gained a terrible mental illness that will never be erased, as a price for looking into the abyss.</p>, <p>[Madness of the Abyss]: Does not lose sanity due to encounters with monsters or mythological beings, magic use, or reading mythological texts. Gains supreme resistance to delirium and fear effects.</p>, <p>However, fear and delirium effects caused by [Shattered Mind] cannot be prevented.</p>, <p>/ Your mind will never collapse. Because it’s already insane…</p>, <p>[Feast Offering]: Increased probability of encountering beings from the abyss…</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>Would skimming through the other special abilities suffice for now?</p>, <p>The most important trait is the [Stat Adjustment] trait which is often attached to hidden characters.</p>, <p>[Supreme Stat Adjustment: You can adjust stats without limits during character creation.]</p>, <p>“Huh? No limits? Really? Seriously?”</p>, <p>Characters with the [Stat Adjustment] trait can modify their initially given stats at creation as they desire.</p>, <p>However, it’s not a free-for-all adjustment. There are penalties and restrictions.</p>, <p>First, the penalty.</p>, <p>To increase one stat, another must be decreased.</p>, <p>For instance, lowering the less important intelligence to increase strength when creating a warrior character.</p>, <p>Then, the restrictions.</p>, <p>This is important: each character has a maximum and minimum stat threshold.</p>, <p>You can’t have abilities over 20 or under 8…</p>, <p><em>But you say now there’s no limits…?</em></p>, <p>Let’s first look at the basic stats.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>Strength: 8</p>, <p>Health: 10</p>, <p>Agility: 11</p>, <p>Intelligence: 18</p>, <p>Mental Strength: 14</p>, <p>Charm: 16</p>, <p>Remaining Stats: 0</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>The basic stats and traits were set for a typical glass cannon mage.</p>, <p>Although these characters have weak bodies, they can wield powerful magic unmatched by others.</p>, <p>As I mentioned earlier, normally you can’t reduce a specific stat below 8.

I’ve created a character with an intelligence of 30!</p>, <p>…Ah, damn it. The community is still empty.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, a never-before-seen sentence was displayed in the tooltip window showing a detailed explanation of intelligence.</p>, <p>[Intelligence 30: Mythical. You have knowledge beyond human reach and a wisdom that borders on madness.]</p>, <p>Huh? What’s this? I’ve never seen a message like this before. Could it be? A hidden trigger?</p>, <p>The thought that I might have activated another hidden trigger made my heart race with excitement.</p>, <p>“Yeah, this level of madness is required to be considered a truly insane mage.”</p>, <p>In fact, it’s generally better for survival to create a character with a well-balanced set of stats rather than one with such a lopsided distribution.</p>, <p>But this time, it’s all about the extreme madness concept!</p>, <p>If it doesn’t work out, I can just delete it and start over…</p>, <p>Next were the traits.</p>, <p>As a [Mage Gazing into the Abyss], I had more traits than other characters, but like my stats, I could add other traits by choosing detrimental penalty traits.</p>, <p>Having already sacrificed my strength, extreme penalty traits were added.</p>, <p>[Weakened Stamina]</p>, <p>[Weakened Strength]</p>, <p>[Weakened Health]</p>, <p>[Weakened Close Combat]</p>, <p>[Increased Damage]</p>, <p>[Weakness: Disease]</p>, <p>[Inability to Use: Heavy Weapons]</p>, <p>[Increased Injury Probability]</p>, <p>[Weakness: Poison]</p>, <p>Hmm… Should I add [Decreased Stamina]? But can I handle not being able to walk for long?</p>, <p>Is it okay to add [Reduced Healing]?</p>, <p>And then…</p>, <p>And also…</p>, <p>In exchange for shouldering such penalties, I was able to incorporate a plethora of useful traits necessary for magic.</p>, <p>Now, what were some good traits for a mage…</p>, <p>It had been a while since I created a mage character…</p>, <p>Wow! The [Spell Mastery] came free for the [Mage Gazing into the Abyss].</p>, <p>It was an excellent class.</p>, <p>Unlocking [Spell Mastery] requires a very large cost.</p>, <p>The prerequisite conditions were incredibly complex.</p>, <p>This trait allowed the use of basic spells from the available hierarchy without any separate learning process. Without it, many who created mages couldn’t cast spells simply because they didn’t know them.</p>, <p>The fact that this top-tier trait was provided for free made the [Mage Gazing into the Abyss] an exceptionally good character.</p>, <p>Then, I added [Secret Lore Understanding] and [Spell Enhancement: Maximization].</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Power Boost]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Range Extension]</p>, <p>[Quick Casting]</p>, <p>[Double Chanting]</p>, <p>[Cast Skipping]</p>, <p>[Catalyst Compensation]</p>, <p>[Spell Stealing]</p>, <p>…And although these were not a mage specialty, the always useful [Precise Aiming] and [Vigilance].</p>, <p>Huh, do I have traits left over?</p>, <p>Then let’s upgrade [Vigilance] to [Enhanced Vigilance],</p>, <p>And then…</p>, <p>And again…</p>, <p>As a result of adding a whopping 11 penalty traits, I added an equal number of useful traits.</p>, <p>Ultimately, I created the most powerful mage ever, steeped in the Cthulhu mythos’ dark shadows, surpassing all the characters I had made before.</p>, <p>Of course, this came at the cost of virtually sacrificing my own body and life.</p>, <p>But this, in its own way, fitted the concept and pleased me.</p>, <p>“Okay, that’s the setup done. Magic power! That’s all I’m counting on!”</p>, <p>The moment I clicked the [Game Start] button, the mouse cursor vanished, and the monitor screen went dark.</p>, <p>The computer showed no response.</p>, <p>“Damn, another bug…!”</p>, <p>The dark screen of the monitor began to flicker strangely.</p>, <p>A character-specific opening video?</p>, <p>That seemed unlikely.</p>, <p>The liquid crystals of the monitor itself started to flow strangely.</p>, <p>The center of the monitor split apart horizontally with a loud crack. It opened like the jaws of a beast, no longer resembling any object from the reality I knew.</p>, <p>It was a dreadful darkness, seething like a dark swamp. It was a horrible filth, filled with disgusting sewage. It was rotting chaos, a grotesquely distorted remnant of a broken reality, and fragments of a nightmare that should never be remembered.</p>, <p>And it was a pit of ravenous abyss.</p>, <p>From that hideous pit, ominous black slime began to pour out, writhing like a living fragment of a monstrous creature.</p>, <p>I couldn’t move my body. My tongue and lips were motionless.</p>, <p>I had a mouth, but I couldn’t scream. I had arms and legs, but I couldn’t move. A terrible malice was approaching me…</p>, <p>But I couldn’t escape.</p>, <p>The cold, horrific slime started to envelop me, moving in ways inexplicable and bizarre in human terms.</p>, <p>I couldn’t escape.</p>, <p>I wanted to scream.</p>, <p>I wanted to scream!</p>, <p>I couldn’t scream!</p>, <p>I wanted to scream so badly!</p>, <p>In just a fleeting moment,</p>, <p>I…</p>, <p>Like I said, I…!</p>, <p>The freedom to close my eyes or turn my gaze away had been stripped from me.</p>, <p>I had no choice but to watch that terrible monster eroding my flesh. I couldn’t breathe. My consciousness was fading. Death was approaching. No, in this bizarre abyss, even death itself seemed destined to die.</p>, <p>At the edge of my fading consciousness, I heard a voice.</p>, <p>A bizarre voice that seemed to pour out not from one mouth but from hundreds or thousands of maws at once.</p>, <p>The voice struck not my ears but my brain.</p>, <p>No, it felt like it was imbued with such force that it directly struck my soul.</p>, <p>“The feast offering… is now prepared.”</p>]\n",

A platoon-sized horde of zombies was rushing in.</p>, <p>[System: The ‘Feast’s Offering’ penalty trait has been activated.]</p>, <p>[Beings from the abyss are showing interest in you.]</p>, <p><em>Ahh… so that’s what happened…</em></p>, <p>It didn’t make sense, but what could I do?</p>, <p>Zombies were not beings of the abyss. The beings of the abyss designated by the system are surreal deities or otherworldly rulers. It seems like some great being exerted an inexplicable influence and herded these zombies towards me.</p>, <p>Now, the zombies were close enough for me to clearly see them.</p>, <p>The spacious corridor was so crowded with zombies that they continuously pushed against each other.</p>, <p>The sight of a fallen zombie being trampled and crushed by others rushing from behind…It was quite the spectacle.</p>, <p>Each zombie’s state of decay and bodily damage varied, but they were all wearing half-tattered white gowns.</p>, <p>They were likely all researchers of this facility once.</p>, <p>Once intelligent minds that reached for forbidden knowledge to surpass human limits but now fallen.</p>, <p>However, now they were zombies, neither living nor dead.</p>, <p>Little of their human appearance remained.</p>, <p>Their hands and feet sported gruesomely long fingernails, and their bodies, riddled with wounds, oozed sticky black fluid.</p>, <p>Some had an arm or a leg missing.</p>, <p>Others had their intestines spilled from gaping abdominal wounds.</p>, <p>And some had their skulls shattered and their brains exposed.</p>, <p>As in many games, zombies in [Cthulhu World] were considered lower-level, insignificant monsters.</p>, <p>But…when you face them in reality, you feel a chilling terror that cannot be replicated in any virtual experience.</p>, <p>An ordinary human would have been instantly overwhelmed by the realistic killing intent and the repugnant odor.</p>, <p>Despite such realism, I felt no particular shock or fear.</p>, <p><em>Wow, damn. It’s real, really real.</em></p>, <p>It was indeed real.</p>, <p>Real zombies.</p>, <p>An overwhelming sense of reality that couldn’t be dismissed as mere imagination or a dream.</p>, <p>What astonished me was not the zombies, but the absurdity that this situation had become my reality.</p>, <p>[Zombies, oozing foul black fluid, approach you. Their numbers are overwhelming. It’s an inescapable, worst-case scenario. You sense the horrific smell of death and their irrational movements. Seeing their bizarre and grotesque forms, you should feel a physiological repulsion, a dizzying terror, helplessness, and despair.]</p>, <p>Despair, as if. I told you, I don’t feel any fear.</p>, <p>[System: Attempting to resist fear with your mental strength stat. Mental strength check… failure.]</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>Ahh, I was so surprised that I exclaimed in astonishment.</p>, <p>Failure? Seriously? Oh, is it because it’s a probability-based judgment?</p>, <p>[However, you have already gazed into the deep abyss. The madness of the abyss paradoxically becomes a shield that preserves your sanity…]</p>, <p><em>Fizzle-</em></p>, <p>A bright white spark erupted at my temples and it erased the artificially induced fear that was about to take hold of me.</p>, <p>[System: Unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ activated. Fear effect removed.]</p>, <p>At this point, I started to understand what was happening.</p>, <p>I was not an ordinary human. With the [Madness of the Abyss] trait, no matter how repulsive these monsters were, they couldn’t inflict any harm on my mind.</p>, <p>And I possessed a power beyond that.</p>, <p>“Hey, zombies, don’t come any closer.”</p>, <p><em>– Grrrrr…</em></p>, <p>As if they would listen to my words. They lacked the intelligence to do so. But that’s not it… As the horde of zombies drew closer, my mind became calmer, and I began to realize what I could do, what I needed to do. Alright, show them, Kim Shin-hwa. Show them what you can do!</p>, <p>I directed my will towards the bonfire which was now barely more than a few small embers.</p>, <p>My enormous intelligence stat of 30 began to come into play. All the calculations needed for manipulating magical power were performed in an instant, and my will materialized in reality at a speed beyond the speed of thought.</p>, <p>As I began to manipulate magic in earnest, my magical power started to become visible.</p>, <p>The magical energy scattered around me began to swirl violently.</p>, <p><em>Are those red, twinkling lights covering the entire room all my magical power?</em></p>, <p>It felt surreal, like being inside some fantastic special effect.</p>, <p>[Flame Manipulation]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Woosh-</em></p>, <p>The flames grew explosively large.</p>, <p>The fire, now deserving to be called a flame, expanded its reach in an instant and it surged towards the zombies like a living creature.</p>, <p>Originally, Flame Manipulation was a minor spell with the effect of changing the direction of flames.</p>, <p>This minor, trivial spell, combined with the [Spell Enhancement: Maximization] trait, was amplified to an unbelievable degree.</p>, <p><em>Pukwakwagwagak!</em></p>, <p><em>– Kieeeeeergh!</em></p>, <p><em>– Kaaaaaargh!</em></p>, <p>Oh, what’s this… The firepower is much stronger than I expected.</p>, <p>No, it wasn’t just that.</p>, <p>The amount of magical power emanating from my body was… far too immense!</p>, <p>Excessively, overwhelmingly immense.</p>, <p><em>What’s this, this enormous amount of magical power?</em></p>, <p>As I began to release my magical power in earnest, the energy stored in my mana core started to pour out.</p>, <p>It was like the floodgates of a long-closed dam being opened.</p>, <p>Pure magical power gushed forth.</p>, <p>It was uncontrollable!</p>, <p>And despite releasing such an immense amount of magical power, the energy in my mana core showed no sign of diminishing. In fact, it was even more than just that.</p>, <p><em>What is this? It’s like an entire ocean!</em></p>, <p>It might not be the best analogy in a situation of spewing fire, but it felt like pouring the entire ocean into a situation that required just a cup of water.</p>, <p><em>How far can I go?</em></p>, <p>The shining particles of magical power moved at my command.</p>, <p>And all of this energy was being poured into the flames that were incinerating the zombies.</p>, <p><em>Shhhh-</em></p>, <p>The flames had now become a massive wall of fire, engulfing the entire corridor from where the zombies were emerging.</p>, <p>With such power, it was almost comparable to an upper-tier third-order spell—no, if I pushed it further, it may even reach a lower-tier fourth-order spell—despite being just a basic zero-order spell meant for manipulating the flow of fire and kindling campfires!</p>, <p>The zombies were undead beings who did not feel pain and they just kept pressing forward despite the blazing flames. However, even the few elite zombies displaying such tenacity were reduced to mere cinders in the face of the towering inferno.</p>, <p>“Have I defeated them…?”</p>, <p>Ah, that was a mistake. I quickly shut my mouth, but the aftermath of my unnecessary ominous statement was almost immediate.</p>, <p><em>– Growwwl!</em></p>, <p>There….at the very back of the zombie horde, which was ablaze with fire, a new challenger emerged.</p>, <p>Outstanding aggressiveness and presence that could be felt even from a distance.</p>, <p>A hulking figure, filling the narrow corridor all by itself.</p>, <p>Its body was grotesquely swollen, twisted, and contorted.</p>, <p>It was the [Giant Zombie], the so-called mid-boss of this secret research facility. Setting aside its generic name, which seemed like it was slapped on the spur of the moment, why did this creature crawl all the way to this place?</p>, <p><em>Wasn’t this thing supposed to be encountered one floor above? Could this be the effect of [Feast Offering]? Doing as it pleases, huh.</em></p>, <p>Unlike the other zombies, this one possessed something akin to intelligence.</p>, <p>Although I call it intelligence… it had just enough to prevent itself from mindlessly charging into the massive flames…Still, that level of cognition made it dangerous.</p>, <p><em>– Growwwllll!</em></p>, <p>The Giant Zombie, with its bulging muscles, began to grab the other zombies and hurl them toward me. Wow, this creature was incredibly strong. Flaming zombies started flying towards me.</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>This was a spell for exerting minor telekinetic powers.</p>, <p>I thought of using spells like [Barrier] or [Distortion Field], but those were first-order spells and were beyond my current ability to cast.</p>, <p>Even if I possessed immense magical power, a first-order spell was still a first-order spell.</p>, <p>The only spells available to me now were the basic zero-order ones.</p>, <p>However, I overcame the lack of efficiency by pouring in an excess of magical power, and the limited effects were compensated for with my transcendent ability to manipulate magic.</p>, <p>I conjured up the image of grabbing the incoming zombies with the [Invisible Hand].</p>, <p><em>Wagjajajajak!</em></p>, <p>“Uh?”</p>, <p>I used too much power.</p>, <p>The zombies, which were flying towards me energetically, were instantly crushed like tomatoes in an invisible compactor, their juices completely squeezed out.</p>, <p>It wasn’t a particularly pleasant sight. But what was more horrifying than witnessing something so human-like being burned or destroyed was the fact that my mind felt no emotion or shock at the scene.</p>, <p>There was no time for sentiment.</p>, <p>If I lingered here any longer, more of them would come.</p>, <p>I moved my magical power and drove a new image into [Invisible Hand].</p>, <p><em>Sssss- piyuu-</em></p>, <p><em>Bang!</em></p>, <p>How could such a sound be produced…? All I had done was grab the zombie’s flesh out of thin air and hurl it at the giant zombie. But the flesh of the zombie was shot with the force of a cannonball, and the giant zombie, caught in this absurd attack, was completely shattered into pieces.</p>, <p>Around this time, the cries of the zombies that had been swarming in madness also stopped.</p>, <p><em>I guess that sort of wraps things up… The smell is terrible though.</em></p>, <p>The burning bodies of the zombies were spreading a pungent odor mix of acrid burnt flesh and an unpleasant rotten stench.</p>, <p>But I could feel a strange vibration coming from afar.</p>, <p><em>– Woo-woo-woo…</em></p>, <p>Was it that zombies from other floors were all converging here…? Kim Shin-hwa, you’re quite popular, aren’t you?</p>, <p><em>Ah, this is annoying.</em></p>, <p>I briefly scratched my head and then changed my mind. It would be a waste of time to follow the official route of dealing with zombies in a meaningless manner.</p>, <p>I looked around the space I was standing in.</p>, <p>A simple, rectangular space caught my eye.</p>, <p>There was only one exit.</p>, <p>On the wall to the left of the exit… there were one, two, three, and four test tubes. There were people inside, but it wasn’t good to disturb them.</p>, <p>On the opposite wall was one desk, and then another. That’s it.</p>, <p>At the second desk… there used to be an option to [Investigate]… but now I had to search it myself. Damn it, I’m short on time.</p>, <p>When I played this as a game, there was a message that would appear when this desk was investigated.</p>, <p>What was the content again…?</p>, <p><em>It should be, [Found a handgun in the bottom drawer of the desk].</em></p>, <p>Even as a veteran player, I wouldn’t normally remember such trivial sentences from an insignificant location.</p>, <p>Yet the fact that I remembered it so vividly implied that the effects of my increased intelligence weren’t limited to just the use of magic.</p>, <p>In the very bottom drawer of the desk there was indeed a handgun.</p>, <p>Even with heightened intelligence, abilities that I didn’t possess before didn’t suddenly manifest in my mind.</p>, <p>The way I held the gun felt awkward even to me.</p>, <p>“So this is the safety lock, and I pull this and then shoot?”</p>, <p>The gun wasn’t the important part. Even if I had it, it wasn’t something I could use effectively.</p>, <p>What mattered was that, according to my memory, the gun was indeed there.</p>, <p>This was the world inside the game of [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>I had been to this [K-3675 Secret Research Facility] thousands of times before.</p>, <p>Not just this place, but I knew the locations of almost all secret doors, hidden places, and items in [Cthulhu World], and now I possessed a surreal intelligence that allowed me to remember all those details precisely.</p>, <p>So maybe… was that also implemented?</p>, <p>I found myself eyeing a wall next to the corridor where zombies were swarming in.</p>, <p><em>Originally, this is where you’re supposed to rub against…</em></p>, <p>It was a wall reinforced with mechanical devices and steel plates. The location was accurate from what I remembered. From now on, I have to rub against this wall.</p>, <p><em>Umm… But how exactly should I rub against it?</em></p>, <p>No, not literally rubbing my body against it…</p>, <p>As much as I love it, [Cthulhu World] was not a perfect game.</p>, <p>Far from being perfect, it was actually riddled with bugs to the extent of being shunned by players.</p>, <p>That’s why, in the game, there were often objects you couldn’t interact with or walls that “somehow, if rubbed the right way, could be passed through”.</p>, <p>That’s precisely the wall that’s in front of me right now.</p>, <p>A spot I often used during my speedrun attempts. But this action of “how to rub against it” that I mentioned earlier, how exactly should I do it? Perhaps, even if it was the world of that buggy game, I shouldn’t assume that the same bugs would still be here?</p>, <p>I slowly reached out and felt the wall with my hand, only to sense the cold touch of the steel plates.</p>, <p>It was an ordinary wall that one wouldn’t expect he’d pass right through it. But, maybe…</p>, <p>I immediately cast one of the basic zero-order spells, [Detect Secret Door].</p>, <p><em>Papapa-</em></p>, <p>Magical power extended from my fingertips, transforming into a luminous line that reached toward the wall.</p>, <p>The magical lines spread out like a complex circuit diagram and they swiftly branched out, covering the wall in an instant.</p>, <p>The structure of the wall flowed into my mind.</p>, <p>The thickness and strength of the wall, the configuration of the mechanical devices within, and then… yes! I found a hidden switch!</p>, <p>When I forced the switch detected by my magical power to activate, a secret door hidden in the wall opened.</p>, <p>Beyond the dark and large hole that opened between the walls, I glimpsed a secret passage stretching far into the distance.</p>, <p>“But this is too strange…”</p>, <p>In the game, I accepted it without much thought, but now that its structure has been realized in reality, the awkwardness of this place became strikingly apparent.</p>, <p>Why on earth would they create such a passage?</p>, <p>What was more troubling was the secret mechanism I had just used.</p>, <p>In the game, this passage could only be accessed through a kind of bug.</p>, <p>Originally, there was no door created in the game, and this passage itself was a result of the game developers’ mistake. But now, it seemed almost like it was intentionally designed.</p>, <p>It felt as if this place was testing whether I could discover it.</p>, <p><em>Though it feels like I’m being tricked, it’s better than wasting time dealing with zombies.</em></p>, <p>It wouldn’t be too difficult, but I had no desire to engage in such a wasteful effort. My immediate goal was to escape this research facility as quickly as possible.</p>, <p>The noise of the zombies was close at hand. Ah, right. Let’s go, go. Whether it’s a trap or not, I’ll find out once I’m in.</p>, <p>With that thought, I entered the dark passage.</p>, <p>Continuing straight on this path should lead me directly to the boss room of this [K-3675 Secret Research Facility]</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The long corridor extended irrationally.</p>, <p>It was comprised of slopes at ambiguous angles.</p>, <p>A slowly descending spiral corridor that gradually burrows underground.</p>, <p>I had no intention of delving into the secret research facility that was buried underground and performing all kinds of trivial puzzles or battles.</p>, <p><em>Let’s head straight to the boss room and deal with the boss.</em></p>, <p>From my experience so far, quickly clearing the level to obtain the reward for the shortest completion time was far more beneficial than scraping together small amounts of experience points.</p>, <p>Of course, apart from such game-minded thoughts, I was more eager to escape the suffocating underground and check the surrounding situation.</p>, <p>There was no lighting, so the surroundings were pitch-black, but this was not a big problem for me.</p>, <p>The moment I became aware of the darkness, I was able to cast my spells with almost subconscious speed.</p>, <p>[Moonlight Vision]</p>, <p>A basic zero-order spell that provides magical vision which allows you to see in all directions even in the dark.</p>, <p>The flow of my magical power was as natural as changing my expression or moving my finger.</p>, <p>What kind of spell should be used in what situation, and how should that spell be activated?</p>, <p>All of this was already in my mind.</p>, <p><em>– Woo woo woo woo!</em></p>, <p>Every now and then, I could hear the howling of zombies from beyond the walls, alerted by my presence.

Why did this happen only to me?</p>, <p>For a moment, I thought maybe I had gone mad from being too absorbed in the game, but the sight of the zombies I had seen earlier, the impact, and the smell were too real to be mere delusions.</p>, <p>Suddenly, one of the settings of [Cthulhu World] came into my mind.</p>, <p>No, it was a setting from the Cthulhu Mythos, which the [Cthulhu World] game was based on.</p>, <p>“The blind Idiot god.”</p>, <p>An entity that might be the starting point of the world.</p>, <p>The most primitive and pure being created by the chaos that boiled up from the deepest part of the abyss.</p>, <p>An amorphous evil that will make you cursed just by mentioning his name.</p>, <p>A being so vast that the meager human brain could not even fathom his form.</p>, <p>The most blasphemous and holy being from the depths of outer space.</p>, <p>The king of everything, the blind idiot god.</p>, <p>If he… really existed?</p>, <p>What if the reality I knew was just a part of the vast universe and abyss?</p>, <p>It would be possible to create the world of the game and summon me to this place, right?</p>, <p>Asking “why?” is meaningless.</p>, <p>By chance? Just because? Or a whim? It could be something less than that, or more.</p>, <p>In the world of [Cthulhu World], even thinking or uttering his true name could drive one mad, so his name is kept secret, but I knew his true name.</p>, <p>His true name was “Azathoth”.</p>, <p>I knew even his name.</p>, <p>Although his name was kept a secret,</p>, <p>Thinking about it in my mind or uttering it could drive me mad, his true name…</p>, <p>Wait, why is everything before my eyes becoming blurry?</p>, <p>I felt an unpleasant sensation as if the world was turning upside down…</p>, <p>[□□□□ □□□□ □□□□□]</p>, <p>My vision was impaired.</p>, <p>A message window appeared in the air, but I couldn’t read its contents.

Focusing on this would be endless.</p>, <p>After a long walk, I finally reached the end of the corridor.</p>, <p>At the end of the narrow passage awaited a large iron door.</p>, <p>Beyond that door lay the challenges I had to overcome.</p>, <p><em>The boss room is right after this.</em></p>, <p>After defeating him, I could finally get out.</p>, <p>I deactivated [Moonlight Vision] and opened the door… Damn, this door is too heavy! I had to push with almost my whole body to barely open it.</p>, <p>I blinked for a moment due to the sudden bright light.</p>, <p>Beyond the iron door was a vast warehouse.</p>, <p>It was almost the size of a school auditorium.</p>, <p>Large containers were placed all around, and the ceiling was about twice the height of other spaces, perhaps to accommodate such large cargo.</p>, <p>This was the underground warehouse of the secret research facility. If you defeat the deliberately placed monsters, you could use the cargo elevator to go to the surface.</p>, <p>All normal exits had been sealed, so this was the only passage I could use.</p>, <p>The enemy waiting here was a monster equivalent to this research facility’s boss, but with my current magical power, I could handle it without any issues.</p>, <p><em>Crunch, crunch</em></p>, <p>A strange noise could be heard coming from inside as if something hard was being chewed and swallowed.</p>, <p><em>It’s over there…</em></p>, <p>The haphazardly placed containers formed walls, obscuring the monster from view.</p>, <p>If I navigated through these containers, I would encounter the huge creature that made this underground warehouse its lair… Huh?

What can I do if I go back?</p>, <p>Stop! No, move!</p>, <p>My thoughts spun wildly. For a moment, I was paralyzed, unsure of what to do, and in my clumsy movement, I alerted the bear-sized ra… Oh, just thinking of the word nearly drove me crazy.</p>, <p>The monster! That horrific monster had noticed me.</p>, <p>It rolled its large, black, inscrutable eyes, staring at me.</p>, <p>Those eyes!</p>, <p>Those dreadful eyes!</p>, <p>The monster itself wasn’t the problem.</p>, <p>Yes, according to the data, there was no problem with the enemy.</p>, <p>It was nicknamed the ‘Rookie Killer’, but for the current me, it was nothing more than a trivial beast.</p>, <p>However, the mere fact that it resembled “that creature” scattered my concentration to the winds.</p>, <p>Hurry, quickly.</p>, <p>The most powerful spell I could use at this moment</p>, <p>I needed the most powerful and immense spell.</p>, <p>“Jjiiik!”</p>, <p>“Aaaah!”</p>, <p>Startled by the loud noise reminiscent of “that creature”, I tried to recklessly fire the handgun I was clutching in my hand.</p>, <p>“Ugh!”</p>, <p>It wasn’t just my improper shooting stance that was the problem, but my weak, almost sickly body couldn’t withstand the recoil of the gun.</p>, <p>The bullets veered off in a random direction, and my arm was completely twisted and flailing in the wrong position.</p>, <p>It was fortunate I didn’t drop the handgun. Ah, Kim Shin-Hwa, you idiot! You have to use magic, not guns or anything like that. I needed to summon my magical power quickly!</p>, <p>The battle had just begun with that recent attack. As for the enemy’s attack pattern, it was…</p>, <p><em>Ho-ho-ho…how crude!</em></p>, <p>It started with a long-range attack. That bastard picked up a large container lying on the ground and hurled it towards me. Thinking about it, was that even possible?</p>, <p>Although it seemed quite powerful even in the game, facing it in reality felt like an entire house was flying at me.</p>, <p>However, the only thing that could induce fear…in me was the form of that boss creature, and the sight of a 30-ton container flying towards me only brought a thrilling sensation.</p>, <p>At the same time, a list of spells I could activate immediately flashed through my mind. The thing that is my immediate adversary…. when I think that it is not that creature, my mind becomes clearer.</p>, <p>There was no need to dodge. Well, in truth, my posture was too messy to dodge anyway!</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Power Boost]</p>, <p>The magical power that boiled up at lightning-like speed transformed into a violet glowing netherworld energy and was discharged through my fingertips.</p>, <p>It was originally a spell that fired purple glowing magic arrows, but I infused it with an excessive amount of magical power and a double enhancement of the spell’s properties, causing it to overload into an absurd size.</p>, <p>Rather than an arrow, it looked more like a gigantic pillar of magical power soaring through the air as if I hurled a telegraph pole.</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>A huge explosion occurred in mid-air.</p>, <p>And the debris was scattered everywhere.</p>, <p>The explosion was so powerful that it shook the inner walls of the underground warehouse.</p>, <p>It was more powerful than I thought…The boss monster created based on “that creature’s” appearance visibly flinched at the blast’s overwhelming force. Even I was surprised by its magnitude, so it must have been frightening for it.</p>, <p><em>It’s not the time to be smug, though…</em></p>, <p>I had used far too much magical power just to block a projectile. Such a waste.</p>, <p>I released so much magical power that it hadn’t completely combusted and now pooled around the scattered fragments of containers and cargo.</p>, <p><em>Oh my, my magical power…</em></p>, <p>What a waste! Even if I had plenty of magical power to spare still, my game-trained brain scolded me for my hasty spellcasting. Alright, I’ll need to use it more carefully from now on.</p>, <p><em>Besides, the way the walls and ceiling shook earlier was not a good sign…</em></p>, <p>The last thing I wanted was to be crushed under a collapsing building because I used too powerful a spell.</p>, <p><em>– jjiiiig! jjiiiig!</em></p>, <p>That sound gave me the creeps. Of all things, that creature’s cry…</p>, <p>“Damn it, just roar a kwaaaang or something else!”</p>, <p>The monster then moved its huge body and rushed toward me. Yeah, right. You too must realize that throwing something at me won’t work.</p>, <p>I was grateful that I didn’t succumb to panic. Had I fell to that mental distortion, the sight of that massive creature swiftly closing in with its… fu*king grotesque appearance… would have surely made me faint.</p>, <p>I assessed my remaining magical power and calculated what I could use.</p>, <p>There were many options for a response, but the spell I chose next was somewhat unconventional.</p>, <p>[Veil of Darkness]</p>, <p>There were almost no offensive spells in the zero-order.</p>, <p>Veil of Darkness was a mere auxiliary spell that shrouds a desired area or target in shadows, making it less visible.</p>, <p>It was used for concealment or disruption and it wasn’t really meant for combat.</p>, <p>But for me, at this moment, it was the spell I needed most, so much so that I was willing to forsake defense completely.</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>I threw myself to the side as the spell activated, narrowly avoiding a direct hit. Of course, the creature was also startled by the sudden darkness.</p>, <p>The monster crashed into the spot where I had been, completely obliterating the containers behind me. Oh boy, what is this strength? Is it trying to play a game of container-smashing with me?</p>, <p>I couldn’t let my guard down. The impact from its immense mass was tremendous. A direct hit at this point would be deadly. But now, I could fight.</p>, <p>The dreadful monster was now enveloped in an artificially created magical darkness, leaving behind only its dark silhouette.</p>, <p>Of course, it hadn’t vanished.</p>, <p>It was just temporarily obscured.</p>, <p>“Ha, fu*k. Now I can fight. Die!”</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>One enhancement was enough. The earlier one I used was the real waste.</p>, <p>A little earlier, I had focused on increasing the size and power of the arrow. This time, however, I enhanced the spell to launch several arrows at the same time.</p>, <p>The spell wasn’t originally designed to release multiple arrows, making it an inefficient basic spell.</p>, <p>To activate such spells simultaneously, the number of formulas to calculate increases exponentially. The complexity varies depending on one’s magical power; even a reasonably high-level mage might find it overwhelming to handle three to four at the same time.</p>, <p>But the Arrows of Destruction that had appeared before me… there were eight in total.</p>, <p>“Go!”</p>, <p>Energy arrows of the netherworld rained down on the target, who now only looked like a pitch-black mass.</p>, <p><em>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</em></p>, <p>When the energy arrows imbued with fierce explosive power struck the creature, its body instantly reduced to tatters and it let out a terrible scream.</p>, <p>– Jjjjieeeeeeeeeg!</p>, <p>Seeing the innards fly out even beyond the shadowed area, it seemed the creature was completely dealt with. But this wasn’t the end. Even if weak, a boss is still a boss.</p>, <p>This creature had a second phase. If more than half of its blood was drained, a truly horrific pattern would start…</p>, <p>– Jiiiiiiiig!</p>, <p>– Jiiiiiiiiiiieeeg!</p>, <p>– Jiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeg!</p>, <p>From dozens of mouths, a cacophony of unpleasant frequencies poured forth.</p>, <p>It was the minion summoning pattern.</p>, <p>“Ah, seriously… This is driving me crazy.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>– Jiiiiiig!</em></p>, <p><em>– Jiiiiiig!</em></p>, <p><em>– Jiiiiiieeeeeeg!</em></p>, <p><em>A pattern where if you get beaten up enough, you summon your minions to fight with you.</em></p>, <p>…Indeed, that was the case, but the mother creature remained motionless.</p>, <p>It seemed to have died instantly from that earlier attack. If so, dealing with these offspring should be the end of it.</p>, <p><em>Damn it, if it’s dead, it should be over. Why summon minions and then die?</em></p>, <p>I wanted to finish this quickly and get outside.</p>, <p>The [Veil of Darkness] spell made the hidden, pitch-black area hard to see, but as the tumors on “that creature’s” neck burst, small ra… baby squeakers started pouring out.</p>, <p>Since these things were smaller, they were much weaker than their mother, but they resembled that… creature even more closely. If I hadn’t covered the place in shadows beforehand, I would have certainly fallen into a state of delirium.</p>, <p>[Mental illness — Musophobia].</p>, <p>From now on…. Do I really have to go through this mayhem every time I encounter a monster resembling those creatures? I need to find a way to change this mental illness into something else…</p>, <p><em>Here they come. Have they transformed?</em></p>, <p>The offspring, shrouded in the black veil of darkness, began to creep closer. The mother creature still didn’t move. It must be truly dead.</p>, <p>There’s no need to deal with these creatures one by one. They’re just early-stage monsters without any proper magical resistance.</p>, <p><em>But there’s too much cover here. And… Ah! I need to deal with this before they move out of the shadowed area!</em></p>, <p>I extended my hand and projected my magical power onto an object far away.</p>, <p>[Entangling Rope]</p>, <p>The entrails that spilled from the body of the monster which had been destroyed by my spell began to move.</p>, <p>These intertwined intestines, entangled by my magical power, started writhing like serpents with a will of their own.</p>, <p>My target was… one, two, three… twelve in total! Since they were shrouded in shadows, the specific forms of my targets were of no consequence.</p>, <p>Bundles of entrails were launched towards the twelve targets, enacted by my will.</p>, <p>Ensnare my enemies!</p>, <p><em>– Jiijiig.</em></p>, <p><em>– Jiiiiiig!</em></p>, <p><em>– Jiiiiiig!</em></p>, <p>The grotesque forms of the entrails entwined around all my enemies. Of course, this restraint wouldn’t last long; it was so fragile that even a slight struggle by them would be enough to break free.</p>, <p>But this is enough. Preventing them from scattering and attacking from outside the shadowed area I had created was more important. Some began to break free from the entrails, but, in any case, I had succeeded in slowing their movement.</p>, <p>[Intestinal Collapse]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Deadly Poison]</p>, <p>This was a curse that caused the target’s intestines to necrotize and liquefy. Quite a horrific effect for a spell of the zero-order.</p>, <p>Using such a spell on a living being might be hindered by the basic resistance inherent to living organisms. But my intended target was not the living beings but the other entrails moving at my will.</p>, <p><em>Sometimes, you come across such spells.</em></p>, <p>But I didn’t use the entrails because I liked gore or anything like that. Among the [Evil Alignment] spells, there are those powerful in effect but damaging to the caster’s psyche.</p>, <p><em>My sanity level was displayed in the game, but I can’t check it here.</em></p>, <p>I guess the design seemed to aim for a “highly effective yet mentally taxing spell” concept.</p>, <p>But I was a [Mage Gazing into the Abyss], so I was protected from mental damage caused by using such spells thanks to the unique trait called [Madness of the Abyss].</p>, <p>The entrails entangling my enemies soon became inflamed with a dreadful pus.</p>, <p>The bundle of entrails transformed into a deadly, poisonous liquid that infected my enemies.</p>, <p>The poisoned wretches… those creatures screamed terribly, glowing as they writhed. Amidst this, a few charged at me, but…</p>, <p>“Hey, don’t come out of the shadows.”</p>, <p>[Shock]</p>, <p>…A simple shock spell was sufficient to repel them.</p>, <p>As time passed, they could no longer withstand the deadly poison emitted by the sticky venom and began to scream.</p>, <p><em>– Kieeek!</em></p>, <p><em>– Kweeek!</em></p>, <p><em>– Kuaaaa!</em></p>, <p>The unsettling howls that sounded more like human screams than beastly roars echoed around the place.</p>, <p>It was a horrifying scene, reminiscent of a corner of hell.</p>, <p><em>Ugh. It’s not exactly a pleasant sight.</em></p>, <p>I must clarify again, it’s not my taste for gore that led me to this. I simply chose the most efficient spells available to me.</p>, <p>Before long, the underground warehouse fell completely silent.</p>, <p>“Is everything taken care of now…?”</p>, <p>Before I could even finish my thought, a new message appeared in the air.</p>, <p>[Achievement Unlocked!</p>, <p>You have overcome your phobia and defeated the object of your fear.</p>, <p>You have earned the ‘Advanced Achievement: Overcoming Fear.’</p>, <p>As a reward for the achievement, the phobia you have overcome is naturally cured and you will gain additional experience points.]</p>, <p>[System: ‘Mental illness — Musophobia (Fear of Rats)’ has been removed.]</p>, <p>Overcoming a phobia?</p>, <p>Can it even be considered overcome just by forcefully dealing with it like this?</p>, <p>I felt a little awkward in this situation, but I welcomed the disappearance of one of the most uncomfortable forms of mental illnesses.</p>, <p>I deactivated the [Veil of Darkness] to verify if it was truly removed. There lay the rat monsters, entangled and dead, amidst the poisonous mucus and the blood they had vomited. Rat monsters, rat scum, rats, rats…</p>, <p>“Rats… rats, rats, rats…”</p>, <p>Great! I can say what they are! I’ve escaped the curse of these damned rats!</p>, <p>I was so elated that I found myself pointing at the corpses of the rats and laughing triumphantly for a whole while.</p>, <p>[System: Penalty trait ‘Shattered Mind’ activated. Since you currently have only 1 mental illness, a random mental illness will manifest.]</p>, <p>Ah, was it just a fleeting moment of happiness…?…Couldn’t you let me enjoy it a little longer…</p>, <p>Oh, will something else random occur now?</p>, <p>Please, let it be something good… something good…</p>, <p>[System: ‘Mental illness — Triskaidekaphobia (Fear of the number 13)’ has been inflicted upon your mind.]</p>, <p>“Thir… tee… what?”</p>, <p>What kind of ridiculous phobia is that? Who in their right mind would fear the number that’s one more than twelve…?</p>, <p><em>Ah, sh*t, it’s terrifying.</em></p>, <p>It’s not so much fear, but… you know, like in South Korea where elevators have an F button instead of 4. I had that kind of feeling right now, only a million times stronger. The number one less than… fourteen… feels incredibly ominous.</p>, <p>(TN: for those that don’t know, the number 4 sounds like the hanja for “death” (사). Number four is also synonymous with bad luck and death in many other Asian countries.)</p>, <p>I’m not sure which is more ridiculous, fearing rats or the number that’s ten…. plus four…but at least a number won’t come to attack me like the rats, so it seems slightly better.</p>, <p><em>Anyway, I should take the magic stone before escaping.</em></p>, <p>There must be a high-purity magic stone inside the mother rat. Let’s see…</p>, <p>The bodies of the twelve baby rats sprawled around the mother… Wait, that means…</p>, <p>The number of them…</p>, <p>Oh, so it’s… one mother plus twelve babies.</p>, <p>Damn it. I made a point not to look in the direction where those things lay scattered as I headed toward the elevator.</p>, <p>Now was not the time to worry about gathering magic stones.</p>, <p>Especially since the bodies of those grotesque monsters were already unnerving, I didn’t want to linger any longer in a place where they lay in such an ominous number.</p>, <p>When I pressed the elevator button….it opened with an unpleasant creaking sound.</p>, <p>Inside the elevator, several long-abandoned corpses were decaying, and they were emitting a horrendous smell.</p>, <p>“Ughh… excuse me.”</p>, <p>They were obviously beyond any help.</p>, <p>With no space to step, I nudged the nearest body with my foot to make room and stepped in.</p>, <p>As I pushed the body aside, a few centipedes crawled out from its skull amidst some bizarre slime.</p>, <p><em>Well… it’s unpleasant, but nothing particularly out of the ordinary.</em></p>, <p>Even the smell was barely tolerable.</p>, <p>While the sight was shocking, it didn’t evoke any special emotional reaction in me. I simply pressed the button to go to the ground.</p>, <p>I saw my reflection in the elevator mirror.</p>, <p>Wearing a pure white straitjacket and covered with a paper bag with holes in it…</p>, <p>“Ugh, no matter how you look at it, I’m a high-grade lunatic.”</p>, <p>I thought so myself, and others would probably think even worse. At best, I looked like a dangerous experiment that had escaped from some lab.</p>, <p>But there was nothing I could do. An incurable madness was growing within my mind.</p>, <p>While I was lost in those thoughts, the elevator eventually reached the ground.</p>, <p>Now there is nothing stopping me.</p>, <p>If there was anything hindering my progress, it would be the chain and lock hanging on the door.</p>, <p>The player should naturally obtain a key while searching the inside of the facility, but since I skipped the entire process, I didn’t have the key.</p>, <p><em>I could use magic to rip the door off its hinges if I really wanted to… but is that necessary?</em></p>, <p>Oh, now that I think about it, I might be able to get one more achievement.</p>, <p>I released the little remaining magical power I had left and fumbled around with the lock.</p>, <p>It wasn’t through sight, but through touch and a sense beyond that, that I discerned the internal structure of the lock.</p>, <p>It was a plain lock, the kind you’d find on a ceremonial door, with no magical defenses.</p>, <p>I carefully converted my finely tuned magical power into a precise amount of physical force to manipulate the inner workings of the lock.</p>, <p><em>Click, clank.</em></p>, <p>“Good. Looks like anything is possible.”</p>, <p>Actually, this was an important experiment. Without the ability for delicate control and precise power adjustment, I would have either broken the lock or crushed it, making it impossible to open.</p>, <p>In the world of [Cthulhu World], there are far more beings beyond just monsters. No matter how much magical power you have, you wouldn’t survive if all you could do was pour out raw magical power.</p>, <p>Fortunately, my magical talent wasn’t just limited to having a lot of magical power.</p>, <p>[Achievement Unlocked!

            "[<p><em>Grumble….</em></p>, <p>My stomach growled painfully, not just from hunger but from actual pain.</p>, <p>With my frail body that only had a strength and health of 5 each, descending the mountain was already pushing my limits. Now, I found myself walking through the downtown area of Paju City in a state where collapsing wouldn’t have been surprising.</p>, <p><em>Ugh… I managed to increase my strength to 5, but it doesn’t seem to make much of a difference… I should have boosted my health instead!</em></p>, <p>I needed to rest soon, and I needed food.</p>, <p><em>What would I normally do in the early stages of the game?</em></p>, <p>My experiences playing [Cthulhu World] came flooding back. It was a game with so much to do…that I was able to play with different concepts and themes in every playthrough.</p>, <p>I usually started my early gameplay here in Paju City. This was an area that was familiar to me.</p>, <p>Right after leaving the lab, I’d normally take actions fitting the concept of my character.</p>, <p>“A concept befitting my character, huh…”</p>, <p>What would be a good character concept for me, Kim Shin-hwa?</p>, <p>A back-alley mercenary? A trainee from a magic tower? Or maybe…</p>, <p><em>If I chose the criminal concept, I’d probably have targeted an easy guy for the [Home Usurpation].</em></p>, <p>In this world, NPCs that are killed stay dead. They don’t come back for events or stories unless they are resurrected.</p>, <p>So, choosing a house and killing its owner to take it over is a possibility.</p>, <p>It’s a completely villainous play, but [Home Usurpation] can be incredibly useful. Depending on the house, there might be useful buffs or hidden artifacts. There was a time when [Residence] lists were shared among players. Of course, that’s a story from before the players left the game…</p>, <p>Come to think of it, there’s the [serial killer’s mansion] nearby.</p>, <p><em>Taking over the serial killer’s mansion could be useful… It is almost a hidden piece level residence. The [Murderer’s Cleaver] can only be obtained that way, and I can also gain the [Butcher’s Sense] trait. Of course, it comes with a curse…</em></p>, <p>The [Murderer’s Cleaver] was a useful weapon even for a mage. It blocked the opponent’s magic and applied debuffs…</p>, <p><em>My mind’s wandering again. Focus, focus!</em></p>, <p>Once a gaming geek starts thinking about the game, it’s hard to stop his train of thought. Focus!</p>, <p>Anyway, I can’t make that choice right now. If I commit a murder and get caught, I’ll be wanted. This world has police, but what I should really worry about are the “bounty hunters”.</p>, <p>The higher the bounty, the more powerful named NPCs I’d attract.</p>, <p>These NPCs usually have abilities that are tough to beat, and messing with them could mean not having a bone left in my body.</p>, <p><em>In the end, it’s all about money. I need to get some money, rest at a place like a motel, order some delivery food…</em></p>, <p>There are many ways to make money if I invest time, but my body is creaking under the strain with its drastically lowered stats.</p>, <p>I needed rest, and I need it now.</p>, <p>The quickest way to get out of this predicament is obviously…</p>, <p><em>I should use random encounters.</em></p>, <p>There were quite a few dangerous areas in Paju City. In the game, roaming around such places would often lead to random encounters with thugs trying to extort money from you.</p>, <p><em>They may be called thugs, but their level is predictable. I’ll capture them and take their money.</em></p>, <p>This was still a crime, but targeting criminals somehow lessened the risk of getting caught.</p>, <p>“Alright.”</p>, <p>I lifted my head and scanned my surroundings.</p>, <p>This was Paju City.</p>, <p>I was in the red-light district situated in one of Paju’s notorious areas.</p>, <p>In the real world, this place would have a pension or an arboretum in the same place, but it was different here.</p>, <p>The area was filled with the dazzling and provocative lights of neon signs. The typical, stimulating billboards of an entertainment district.</p>, <p>Crowds of people were bustling about underneath these signs.</p>, <p>“Sir, try our skewers! They are seasoned with special spices, and the taste is absolutely incredible!”</p>, <p>I could see a street vendor offering unidentified meat to some passersby who were chattering in foreign languages I couldn’t understand. The meat, seasoned with some kind of exotic spice, emitted a pungent and spicy aroma but wow…. To me, the scent was overwhelmingly disgusting.</p>, <p>“Hey, you, the sexy guy with the mask! I smell magical power from you. Wanna exchange magic stones for cash? Hey, wait! I’ll give you a good rate.”</p>, <p>An illegal money changer… If only I had forcibly brought that magic stone earlier, I wouldn’t have to worry about money. It’s frustrating.</p>, <p><em>If I return later…</em></p>, <p>Thinking about climbing the mountain again with this body made my head spin. I should probably level up a bit more before trying again later.</p>, <p>“Ah, that Flame Dancer bastard, to think he got taken down there!”</p>, <p>“Hey, why the hell would you bet on such a has-been? Are you stupid?”</p>, <p>“No, that’s how you get high odds! Don’t you know about the big score in life?”</p>, <p>These were customers coming out of the gambling arena. There was an underground fighting ring in this area. If you go down into the basement of that bar with the turned-off sign over there, you can enter the arena to place bets or… even participate as a fighter.</p>, <p>This was the nightlife of Paju.</p>, <p>Still, there were no overt troublemakers. It was a dangerous city to meddle too much with others. Paju now was a city of opportunity and pleasure.</p>, <p>People of all races and foreigners so strange they seemed not even from the same planet have settled here, bringing a complex mix of cultures and bizarre technologies and knowledge derived from entities of the Cthulhu mythos.</p>, <p>People wearing strange outfits and people with extraordinary abilities donning equipment with effects hard to gauge.</p>, <p>Some even openly carry artifacts imbued with magical power.</p>, <p>It was a strange and colorful city, but to me, it was all too familiar. It almost felt like coming home.</p>, <p>Even in these bizarre streets, I stood out as quite the odd one. I could hear people whispering and shushing each other.</p>, <p>“Look at that guy. Is he for real?”</p>, <p>“Shh, Yanma, keep it down.”</p>, <p>I can hear everything, retards.</p>, <p>Ah well… I’m not even angry. Descending from the mountain in my dirty straitjacket and wearing a large bread bag, I must look like a madman.</p>, <p><em>I guess I’m just treated as a bit of an odd one…</em></p>, <p>Yet there were still no overt troublemakers. It was a dangerous city if you got too involved with others.</p>, <p>To encounter more aggressive and lively characters, I would need to venture deeper.</p>, <p><em>It’s exactly like the game.</em></p>, <p>The layout of the streets was identical to the game.</p>, <p>Even the dialogue I overheard as I passed by… While there were slight differences in detail, the people were spouting almost the same lines as the NPCs in the game.</p>, <p>If it’s the same as the game, then near the arena… past the trash cans…</p>, <p>There’s an alley hidden between the stalls.</p>, <p>It was a damp back alley, swirling with an unusually dense darkness. Amidst the unpleasant smell of garbage, I could faintly detect the scent of blood.</p>, <p>“Haah…”</p>, <p>Alright, I’m going in. I just need one of them to catch me.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The alley was significantly darker than the bright and flashy lights of the red-light district I had just left behind.</p>, <p>This alley wasn’t even on the map. It was a street created due to surplus space incorrectly created between buildings in the aftermath of careless urban development. A real slum where the darkness of the city gathers congregated.</p>, <p>Although not its official name, everyone referred to this dark street as “Waste Alley”.</p>, <p>“Well…”</p>, <p>But that wasn’t important right now.</p>, <p><em>I’m too exhausted… Humanly speaking, I’m severely lacking in stamina.</em></p>, <p>My arms and legs were numb and I felt like collapsing on the spot.</p>, <p>Even when I worked from home and played games all day long, I wasn’t exactly in the best shape, but now this was just too much!</p>, <p><em>With a health stat of 5, I’m barely better than a patient undergoing rehabilitation…</em></p>, <p>In a way, it’s a miracle I’ve been walking around this long with this body.</p>, <p>I had never walked this alley with my own feet, but it wasn’t unfamiliar to me. To really get into trouble, I needed to go deeper… Maybe I could rest here for a bit…</p>, <p>Eventually, unable to hold on, I slumped down in a secluded spot. The sudden change in posture made the hidden handgun in my coat awkwardly conspicuous.</p>, <p>South Korea was a country where firearms were illegal.</p>, <p>That fact remained unchanged even in this virtual South Korea created by [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>It might seem like a country maintaining public order and security even in a world with monsters, but in reality, it’s just a superficial effort.</p>, <p>It was a world where surreal magic, supernatural powers, and monsters truly existed.</p>, <p>Even North Korea could not withstand the monsters’ rampage and collapsed, leaving only remnants of the country behind.</p>, <p>As a result, refugees and people with special abilities from North Korea flooded into Paju, turning it into complete chaos.</p>, <p>In such a situation, ordinary people without any power had to arm themselves in any way possible to protect themselves in this dangerous city, disregarding public authority.</p>, <p>Therefore, in the world of [Cthulhu World], the rule of “no possession of firearms” only meant “just don’t carry them openly”… but it could become troublesome if one got entangled in complicated situations.</p>, <p><em>I can’t even use this thing anyway…</em></p>, <p>Haaah. Does it even make sense that I can’t shoot a gun because of low strength?</p>, <p><em>Ah, now that my strength has increased to 5, maybe I can shoot a handgun?</em></p>, <p>Even if it’s just a stop-gap measure, a weapon is still a weapon.</p>, <p>It’s too precious to discard in a situation where I don’t know what I might encounter.</p>, <p>Magic wasn’t the solution to everything. There were enemies immune to magic and situations where magic can’t be used can arise at any time.</p>, <p>Now that I’ve sat down, I don’t feel like getting up. If I fall asleep here, I’ll probably die…? Not from being robbed by a vagrant, but from dying of exposure with a health level of 5.</p>, <p>Just as I was gathering my strength to stand up, a strange sound came from somewhere. It was very faint, but I definitely heard it, probably thanks to the [Enhanced Vigilance] trait.</p>, <p><em>Thud- Thud-.</em></p>, <p>A sound like someone pounding meat with their fists. But, since there was no way there would be a back-alley chef tenderizing meat in such a place, it must be the sound of someone beating another person.</p>, <p>When I raised my magical power and focused it on my ears, my senses sharpened instantly.</p>, <p>Enhancing my senses to this extent didn’t require the use of spells. Simply altering the flow of my magical power a bit was sufficient.</p>, <p>The direction and distance are… roughly over there.</p>, <p>Now, just to go in that direction… Just to go… Come on, Kim Shin-hwa! You can do it, Kim Shin-hwa!</p>, <p>“Ughhh… get up… let’s gooooo…”</p>, <p>Before long, I found the target I was looking for.</p>, <p>Three sturdy men were brutally beating up a single man.</p>, <p>“You junkie bastard. Didn’t I tell you to bring the money?”</p>, <p>“…Please, please!”</p>, <p>“Please? What’s with the begging? You want your drugs? Ha, you’re a funny guy.”</p>, <p>The sound of pleading.</p>, <p>Verbal abuse, and one-sided violence.</p>, <p>To be precise, the one who wielded violence was the largest of the three, while his seemingly underling two buddies kept watch.</p>, <p>They were scum who extorted money from the weak under the pretext of drugs while occasionally satisfying their sadistic urges.</p>, <p>The one being beaten was in no better condition, and he was likely a degenerate drug addict.</p>, <p>This was just a trivial incident that was not even worth noting among the list of events.</p>, <p><em>But if it’s a drug-related event… which group might they belong to? Bong Gil-cheon’s gang? Or the Triad? It’d be easier if they were just unaffiliated thugs.</em></p>, <p>“Hey, hey, hold that guy right there!”</p>, <p><em>Thunk-.</em></p>, <p>“Ugh… blargh…”</p>, <p>The drug addict who was struck hard in the stomach vomited yellowish gastric fluid.</p>, <p>This seemed to further provoke them.</p>, <p>“Ah, shit. Do you know how much these shoes cost? You’re gonna die today, you bastard!”</p>, <p>Finally, a knife appeared.</p>, <p>The abnormally excited brute seemed determined not to stop without drawing blood today.</p>, <p>I hesitated to use magic against humans, but if it’s against such trash… They were more like waste fitting for a garbage alley than fellow humans.</p>, <p>Still, I didn’t want to go as far as murder. Spells that could control the force appropriately came to mind. Although it would be easier to just go “Kwawang!” and sweep them all away, I planned to handle it quietly with controlled power.</p>, <p>After all, I had no desire to kill “humans” for no reason, and I was also worried about the potential risks that could come back to haunt me later on.</p>, <p>As the bulky thug brandished his knife and began to go crazy, the attention of his underlings who were keeping watch wavered. Seizing this opportunity, I slowly, very slowly, approached the bald man at the outer edge.</p>, <p>The scalp of his head was clearly exposed. He just so happened to be the ideal target.</p>, <p>[Heating]</p>, <p>A red, glowing magical power shot from my left hand toward the bald man’s head.</p>, <p>It was a basic zero-order spell, designed only to boil water at a specified location. But what if it caused the blood inside his scalp to boil?</p>, <p>Of course, I controlled it to avoid killing him. The bald man’s head turned bright red like a boiled octopus and he muttered a “Huuh…” before collapsing with a groan.</p>, <p>“Wh-what’s this?”</p>, <p>The thug with the cap who had been giggling and egging on the bulky guy, finally noticed me and was shocked. I had to overpower him before he could grasp the situation! This time, I gathered magical power in my right hand.</p>, <p>[Instill Fear]</p>, <p>Dark, tentacle-like magical power wrapped around the cap-wearing thug’s head.</p>, <p>It was a spell that induced involuntary fear and extreme hallucinations. The theme of the hallucination is…. “Cicadas crawling out of every orifice in the face”.</p>, <p>I had experienced cicadas once myself, and it was quite the experience. Now it was his turn.</p>, <p>“Aaah, Aaaah!”</p>, <p>He started to struggle with tears and snot streaming down his face. The intensity of his frenzy made me miss the timing for my next spell by a breath. Damn it, my body couldn’t keep up with my thoughts.</p>, <p>“You fucker… What do you think you’re doing?”</p>, <p>Before I knew it, the bulky thug was sizing me up with the knife in hand. His stance with the knife was stable; he was not just any thug.</p>, <p>“You look like a beggar with that bag on your head… Are you a druggie too?”</p>, <p>I had let my guard down for a moment and now found myself in a standoff, but there was no need to hold the gaze for long. I pushed the cap-wearing thug, who was intermittently crying out ” The cicadas…! The cicadas…!” towards the bulky guy, and set off a flash of light from my fingertips.</p>, <p>“Kaaak!”</p>, <p>I wanted to close in quickly…but my body still wasn’t obeying me…. However, the bulky guy was blinded by the sudden flash of light and he couldn’t stop my approach.</p>, <p>Touching the big guy, I poured the completed spell into his body.</p>, <p>[Lightning]</p>, <p>If I could use first-order spells, I might have shot or spread the lightning from a distance, but with my zero-order casting ability, physical contact was necessary. But isn’t this just like holding a stun gun?</p>, <p>Well, that’s something at least. Take this, full blast! The magical power was converted into electricity and flowed into his body rapidly.</p>, <p>“Aaaah!”</p>, <p>To ordinary people without resistance, magic of this caliber could be lethal.</p>, <p>The bulky thug, struck by the bright blue lightning, convulsed unnaturally as bodily fluids poured from every orifice of his face.</p>, <p>His bulging eyes couldn’t withstand their own pressure, and blood vessels burst, causing blood to flow.</p>, <p>“Ughhhhh…”</p>, <p>Eventually, the thug lost consciousness and collapsed.</p>, <p>[You took down the thugs who extorted innocent people and led filthy lives. Although your good deeds in the shadows may not become widely known, you have acted righteously.]</p>, <p>That message… I’ve been thinking about it since the last time, but somehow isn’t the focus a bit off the mark…?</p>, <p>[You have defeated the thugs. Experience points gained.]</p>, <p>I had hoped for a level-up since the bulky thug reacted quite sharply, but it seemed it wasn’t enough for that.</p>, <p>Leaving the drug addict, who was crouched in a corner scratching himself, I began to search the thugs’ pockets. First, the cash in their wallets… Oh, there’s not much cash.</p>, <p>Instead of money, a bunch of credit cards were stuffed in the wallets. Even criminals use card payments these days? These are useless to take…</p>, <p>After combining the wallets of the bulky thug, the one with the cap, and the bald man… the cash I ended up with was around 200,000 won.</p>, <p>In my current needy situation, I also took their watches, mobile phones, and gold necklaces.</p>, <p>And those expensive shoes, right? Haha, now the shoes are mine too.</p>, <p>Apart from that, nothing much of value came from the bulky thug and the one with the cap, but from the bald man on the outer edge, I found something special. A small plastic bag containing divided white powder. Oh, a magical powder that makes you feel good.</p>, <p><em>How should I dispose of this…?</em></p>, <p>There are many ways to dispose of it. If I were to do it the careless way, I might start a criminal route, or the main drug distributor might send pursuers. I don’t want to mess with such people…</p>, <p><em>But I should keep it. I don’t want to regret it like I did with the research lab’s magic stones.</em></p>, <p>The plastic bag filled with drugs appeared to contain about thirty packets, and I threw one to the drug addict whose eyes were filled with greed.</p>, <p>Then I raised a finger to the corner of the paper bag mask I was wearing (even though my mouth couldn’t be seen…) and whispered,</p>, <p>“Shush.”</p>, <p>He desperately nodded his head while clutching the packet I had thrown before fainting.</p>, <p>Given that my eyes behind the holes in the mask were likely burning with a blue, magical light, it must have been quite a terrifying sight for him.</p>, <p>Anyway, I had gotten everything I needed.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p><em>Thud.</em></p>, <p>A dirty ceiling. A cramped room.</p>, <p>“Ah… that was exhausting.”</p>, <p>With trembling arms and legs, I managed to enter an unmanned hotel up in a dark alley.</p>, <p>I could have afforded a better room with the money I took from the thugs, but no matter how close Paju was to a lawless place, no hotel would accept a stranger wearing a paper bag over their head without any identity. Even a motel would have been difficult, so I was glad to find an unmanned hotel.</p>, <p>I threw myself onto the damp bed, too tired to even think about washing up.</p>, <p>I wanted nothing more than to fall asleep and ignore everything else, but various thoughts were scrambling through my mind.</p>, <p>I roughly knew the scenario of [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>[Cthulhu World] boasts a highly free open-world system, where players have the option to do nothing and just let time pass.</p>, <p>Of course, doing so would lead to unavoidable destruction and the end of the human world.</p>, <p>In the darkness of this world, there are cultists plotting for the world’s demise…</p>, <p>“Many, many, many of them.”</p>, <p>I couldn’t just sit idly by.</p>, <p>I had no choice but to move forward in a direction that was beneficial to me in some way.</p>, <p><em>Should I continue this way and aim for the ending…?</em></p>, <p>Several endings floated through my mind.</p>, <p><em>The [Blood King] ending… ends with death at the finale.</em></p>, <p><em>The [Infinite Prisoner] ending… results in being trapped forever in a prison between time and space.</em></p>, <p><em>The [Underground Master] seems pretty good… You can earn a lot of money… No, you become undead in the end….</em></p>, <p><em>The [Eradication of Thought]… involves brainwashing…</em></p>, <p><em>Ah, seriously!</em></p>, <p>[Cthulhu World] is a game with a cosmic horror concept.</p>, <p>Hundreds of endings were prepared, but all of them led to death, madness, or something even more horrific.</p>, <p>That’s right.</p>, <p>I realized I was trapped in a crazy game where every ending was one of doom.</p>, <p>There was only one conclusion I could reach.</p>, <p><em>I can’t stay in this world.</em></p>, <p>I had to escape from this world.</p>, <p>If I continued to exist in this world in any form, I would just be manipulated by those dreadful mythological beings.</p>, <p>I must return to my original world.</p>, <p>It won’t be something that can be accomplished quickly.</p>, <p>I wasn’t sure whether this was truly the world inside a game or if it was someone’s prank, mimicking that world. But somewhere, there had to be a clue for escape.</p>, <p>I needed to find that clue. Or perhaps I had to talk with a higher being who might know the method…. maybe even an entity from the abyss.</p>, <p>I also must find various artifacts.</p>, <p>I would probably need some mythical level stuff.</p>, <p>Could I negotiate with a great race known for their technology in dimensional or time travel?</p>, <p>None of these tasks were something a low-level mage could accomplish.</p>, <p>In this insane, hardcore cosmic horror game, more power was needed to survive even one more day.</p>, <p>And first of all, I would need an ID card and funds to guarantee the minimum level of activity.</p>, <p>Haah… But I’m just too tired right now…</p>, <p>First of all, what I needed right now was rest.</p>, <p>And so, I slowly drifted off to sleep.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was a terrible nightmare I had.</p>, <p>I was aware that I was merely dreaming of this nightmare yet I couldn’t escape from it.</p>, <p>The pouring rain and the chilling moonlight.</p>, <p>The ground split open as massive pillars rose up. Even though this was a place where there shouldn’t be a sea, huge waves crashed in, and the dark sea water covered everything.</p>, <p>The mud and stench, the horrifyingly turbulent rotten and fishy smell.</p>, <p>In the bizarre sky radiating an indescribable light, stood a gigantic—enormously large—green giant.</p>, <p>That massive—great—terrifying—being gazed down at me with its strangely eerie eyes.</p>, <p>Those empty eyes that contained darkness and the abyss! looked down at me!</p>, <p><em>Crackle-</em></p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated. The nightmare effect has been nullified.]</p>, <p>It was the “Nightmare of R’lyeh” event that randomly occurs when dreaming.</p>, <p>It was like a fun broadcast sent randomly by the great Cthulhu buried in the deep sea, but if you got caught in it, you could be forced into losing your sanity.</p>, <p>[Madness of the Abyss] protected my sanity and mind, but it couldn’t prevent the feeling of disgust from rising up.</p>, <p>Such a rare event on the first day! What luck! Shit, it must be because of that trait, right?</p>, <p>[Feast Offering: Increased probability of encountering beings from the abyss]</p>, <p>“Haah…”</p>, <p>I couldn’t help but sigh.</p>, <p>The tacky wallpaper of the cheap unmanned hotel caught my eye. I had escaped the nightmare, but not this unfortunate reality.</p>, <p>I could shove aside the damp, sticky bedsheet, but I couldn’t bring myself to get up.</p>, <p><em>Ah, this is driving me crazy.</em></p>, <p>It’s not like I’ve developed [Mental illness — Lying Down is Best], and I don’t want to waste time lying around when every moment counts.</p>, <p>I wanted to escape this hotel right away but my body wouldn’t move.</p>, <p><em>It’s only natural that I need a warm-up, but really, this body is too much.</em></p>, <p>Ultimately, this was the consequence of my own making.</p>, <p>I thought, “It’s not really my life anyway”, and carelessly loaded myself with penalties, which have now boomeranged back to become my life.</p>, <p>It’s not just a matter of stats. I couldn’t see my HP bar, but due to [Weakened Health], my HP must be extremely low.</p>, <p>Because of [Weakened Strength], my actual physical strength was probably lower than the 5 shown on my status screen.</p>, <p>[Weakened Stamina] meant I had to struggle immensely just to walk a short distance.</p>, <p>And then there was [Weakened Close Combat], [Weakness: Disease], [Weakness: Poison]. I really set myself up for death.</p>, <p>The worst part was the combo of [Increased Damage] and [Reduced Healing]!</p>, <p>Any damage I take is always critical, and any healing I receive is halved.</p>, <p>“Ah, forget it; forget it.”</p>, <p>Starting a quest in this condition was too risky.</p>, <p>A single mistake could be fatal.</p>, <p>If it were just a game, I could laugh it off and play again, but I only had one life here.</p>, <p><em>Hmm… do I really have only one though?</em></p>, <p>The thought of maybe respawning even if I died crossed my mind, but I couldn’t bring myself to experiment with such a terrifying thought using my own life.</p>, <p><em>For now, let’s assume I only have one life.</em></p>, <p>Right, I’ve played plenty of hardcore modes where you can’t resurrect once you die.</p>, <p>For now, it was difficult to offset the penalties attached to my traits immediately. It wasn’t impossible, but I needed to go to places that were currently out of reach at my level.</p>, <p><em>On the other hand, there is a way to address the stats issue right away.</em></p>, <p>I couldn’t operate at maximum efficiency due to my penalty traits, but my stats were terrible anyway. So, I needed to boost my stats first.</p>, <p>That meant… grinding was the way to go.</p>, <p>I could immediately get items like the [Corrupted Flame Ring] and the [Slurping Gloves].</p>, <p>Both were cursed items, but they were the most cost-effective ones among what I could obtain now.</p>, <p>The [Corrupted Flame Ring] had the effect of providing the wearer with the power of fire and granted a +3 strength boost.</p>, <p>The [Slurping Gloves] … despite their funny name, they were equipped with multiple magical effects and a +2 to health.</p>, <p><em>Ugh… I need to get up first.</em></p>, <p>I tried to rise, but my back just wouldn’t support me.</p>, <p><em>Ah… shit…</em></p>, <p>Despite my efforts, managing to dangle my legs off the bed was the best I could do. It seemed better to lie down while I still could.</p>, <p>If only I could move, nothing else would be a problem. I remembered almost everything about this [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>The various dungeons, hidden doors, secret quests, and numerous tricks and bugs to reap rewards without effort.</p>, <p>I also recalled a few useful bugs related to item trading.</p>, <p>If this wasn’t a crazy world full of otherworldly gods and Great Old Ones, I could have made a fortune by trading.</p>, <p>But for that, I needed some initial capital.</p>, <p>Money… how much did I have right now?</p>, <p>I stretched out my leg to pull the wallet rolling on the floor towards me. Ouch, a cramp! A cramp in my foot!</p>, <p>When I suddenly flexed my toes, a cramp shot through my calf, and I had to massage it for a while. Anyway, I got the wallet. Kim Shin-hwa-ssi, let’s use our hands next time.</p>, <p>The money I snatched from the thugs was around 200,000 won. After paying for food and accommodations, I had used about half of it and I guess I had roughly one day’s worth of living expenses left…</p>, <p>I could probably beat up a few more thugs a couple of times, but at my current level, I risked encountering someone too powerful to handle, or worse, becoming the target of a retaliatory assassination.</p>, <p>Moreover, the efficiency of such actions was poor to begin with. Since [Cthulhu World] was based on a modern society, fewer people carried cash than I expected. Who carries cash these days, anyway?</p>, <p>This was a problem that applied to me as well. I needed a bank account and a card, and also an ID.</p>, <p>Perhaps the “fixer route” was the way to go. It was one of the various money-making methods available in [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>If I struck a deal with a savvy broker, they would take care of the money, get me an ID, a burner phone, and sort out various tasks, even scouting for suitable items.</p>, <p>Of course, to receive such services, I had to endlessly complete annoying requests.</p>, <p>Moreover, brokers varied in their skills, and so did the types of requests. Some were almost con artists, and others would betray you the moment they made a decent profit.</p>, <p>If you wanted to play the game for a long time, it was best to work with a trustworthy person even if the pay was less.</p>, <p>Naturally, finding a good broker in a cosmic horror-themed world like [Cthulhu World] was almost as likely as winning the lottery.</p>, <p><em>But that’s a story for beginners who play blindly.</em></p>, <p>Roughly speaking…. perhaps heading to “Furmil” would be a good idea? Or maybe “YB” or “Ko Kyung-soo”, though a bit far, “Tudor” wasn’t a bad choice either.</p>, <p>Each NPC had their own pros and cons. Whoever I chose to make a contract with would greatly influence the atmosphere of the game. Considering my current situation and the stats I needed, the best broker would be…</p>, <p><em>Alright. I’ll go to Tudor.</em></p>, <p>Tudor offered a fixed quest, “The Abandoned Hospital in Gamaksan”. If I was lucky, I could find an S-rank item or something higher over there.</p>, <p>Getting such an item early on would make progress smoother in the future.</p>, <p>Tudor was known for his bad temper, entry restrictions, and the numerous bugs in related events, but he provided opportunities to face mythical creatures from the start, so I often used his services.</p>, <p>Considering the entry restrictions, it seemed best to grind on the way there, starting with the necessary base stats.</p>, <p>The plan was set. Time to get up.</p>, <p>Hmm… I’ll just lie down for 5 more minutes…</p>, <p>In 5 minutes, I’ll really get up.</p>, <p>I wonder if there are any quests I could solve while lying down…</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>In the end, I had no choice but to pay an additional fee because I exceeded the check-out time of the unmanned hotel by more than 2 hours.</p>, <p>It was around 3 p.m.</p>, <p>Unlike Paju City at night, full of madness and revelry, daytime Paju was relatively calm with most of the night businesses closed.</p>, <p>As a result, people who looked blatantly like relatives of criminals weren’t around, and the sight of a madman like me wearing a paper bag was bound to stand out.</p>, <p><em>It just had to be mask obsession… I can’t take it off because I’d go mad for real…</em></p>, <p>But wearing it makes me look mad anyway.</p>, <p><em>Maybe it was Nyarlathotep who dragged me here? Isn’t that guy the real mask-obsessed one?</em></p>, <p>Among Nyarlathotep’s nicknames was something about wearing a thousand masks…</p>, <p>Considering he’s one of the few Outer Gods who would enjoy such pointless antics, it’s almost certain.</p>, <p><em>No, no, can’t jump to conclusions just yet.</em></p>, <p>I still lack enough clues.</p>, <p>Anyway.</p>, <p>This paper bag was not only flimsy but also uncomfortable to wear. I need a replacement in case it gets torn off or ripped during a fight and I fall into delirium.</p>, <p><em>I need to buy a proper mask. Later on, I’ll enchant one and make it myself…</em></p>, <p>Suddenly, a general store caught my eye. The sign read “All that you want”. Well, with a name like that, they should have masks as well.</p>, <p>Such stores were merely background elements during gameplay and couldn’t be accessed, but now I could enter them. The game itself doesn’t seem to be fully implemented.</p>, <p>“Heek!”</p>, <p>Upon entering the store, the clerk let out a gasp. However, since the city itself was rife with odd characters, they refrained from any further reaction.</p>, <p>First, let’s go to the party supplies section… good, there are plenty of masks here. I’d prefer to avoid anything that looks too much like a toy, though… Surely, I’m not planning to stick with this paper bag on my head, am I?</p>, <p>In the end, I bought several party masks and, just in case, picked up some bread bags that could be quickly flipped over and worn. I tucked them away as I left the store.</p>, <p>As soon as I stepped out, I hid in a secluded spot to change masks. I chose a plain white mask labeled something like “Halloween Night”.</p>, <p>Then, I bought an oversized hoodie from a nearby stall. I couldn’t keep stuffing things inside my clothes, so I also purchased a large backpack.</p>, <p>It was a black backpack with a sporty design. Although it had a famous brand’s logo on it, it was probably a counterfeit because it was sold at a street corner, right?</p>, <p>It was a waste of money, but I had no choice as I had a lot of luggage to take care of, like the shoes and watch I had taken from the thugs…. And I even carefully stuffed the straitjacket I was wearing inside.</p>, <p>Since there were already status and message windows popping up left and right, shouldn’t there have been inventory storage or something of the sort….</p>, <p>Anyway, I was ready.</p>, <p>Now, I looked somewhat decent.</p>, <p>Still, I ended up looking like a character playing a criminal in a dramatic reenactment for a current affairs exposé show.</p>, <p>No more dallying needed. Since my destination wasn’t nearby, let’s take the bus….no it was better to hail a taxi rather than a bus.</p>, <p>I worried about not being able to get a taxi but it was surprisingly easy. The driver even joked around, asking if I was headed somewhere fun. To survive as a taxi driver in Paju, which was no different from a den of thieves, one must have at least this amount of guts.</p>, <p>I arrived at…. Unjeong Station, which was arguably the heart of Paju City.</p>, <p>Paju in [Cthulhu World] was more populated than its real-world counterpart. Therefore, the number of people coming and going through Unjeong Station was exceptionally high. It was almost as comparable to the bustling density of Hongdae or Gangnam Station at their peaks.</p>, <p>I carefully observed my surroundings before activating a spell I had prepared.</p>, <p>[Hazy Presence]</p>, <p><em>Sssssss</em></p>, <p>An invisible mist made of magical power began to surround me.</p>, <p>[Hazy Presence] was a minor zero-order spell designed to reduce one’s presence and make them less noticeable.</p>, <p>In essence, it didn’t render me invisible to others; rather, it made them less likely to pay attention to me.</p>, <p>Ideally, I would have preferred to use a fourth-order spell like [Invisibility] or at least a second-order one like [Shadow Walking], but those were beyond my current level.</p>, <p>However, thanks to my magical talent and powerful traits, even the zero-order[Hazy Presence] worked as efficiently as the second-order [Shadow Walking].</p>, <p>This meant that as long as I wasn’t wrapped in hundreds of LED bulbs while shouting “Look at me, everyone in the neighborhood!”, I would be fine.</p>, <p>After blending into the crowd, I made my way to the platform inside the train station.

            "[<p>I no longer had the luxury of time. Everything needed to be finished before the next train arrived.</p>, <p>Since my physical strength was lacking, I had to rely heavily on my intellect to compensate for my lack of strength and health.</p>, <p>That’s why I chose Unjeong Station.</p>, <p>There was a secret place hidden inside Unjeong Station.</p>, <p><em>Right here.</em></p>, <p>Though my health and strength were critically low, my agility was even worse.</p>, <p>[Agility 8: Sluggish]</p>, <p><em>– Ding ding ding ding ding ding di-di-ding… Now, the train to Yongsan, heading for Yongsan, is entering the station.</em></p>, <p>The announcement echoed from the direction of the platform. And I barely reached my intended destination.</p>, <p><em>This place was always interesting.</em></p>, <p>In fact, this location was impossible to enter or receive a preliminary quest from at my current level.</p>, <p>It was a bug known only to me; even other users in the community were unaware of it at the time.</p>, <p>There was a secret door that would open if your character kept jumping and rubbing against the wall until the train arrived.</p>, <p>Jumping until the train’s arrival was one thing, but the real challenge was the “secret door that opens upon rubbing”… Could it be the same as last time?</p>, <p>I placed my hand against the wall and generated my magical power.</p>, <p>[Detect Secret Door]</p>, <p>Magic lines extended from my fingertips and they formed a circuit of blue fluorescent light on the wall.</p>, <p><em>Fzzzzt</em></p>, <p>The magic lines that were moving along the wall quickly found the hidden secret door.</p>, <p>Unlike a normal door, this passage was vertically installed on the ceiling. Who would put a door there? It was impossible to find unless you knew exactly what you were looking for. The structure itself….it was simple, but there was a lock.</p>, <p>This wasn’t much of a problem for me. I concentrated the magical power I had spread out for [Secret Door Detection] to reach the inner workings of the lock. Normally, I would need to physically touch the lock to activate it, but…</p>, <p><em>Whizz!</em></p>, <p>Magical lines spread out like a complex circuit diagram and branched out in an instant, covering the ceiling-mounted door and its lock.</p>, <p>[Unlock]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Range Extension]</p>, <p><em>Click- Clunk</em></p>, <p>Blue sparks flew from the lock that hung out of reach as the door was opened.</p>, <p><em>I wonder if I can still gain experience points from something like this?</em></p>, <p>I would likely need to unlock more advanced, high-tech locks or those secured with magical protections to earn experience points or achievements. Maybe I should set aside a day to go around unlocking as many locks as I can?</p>, <p>But the real challenge was what came next.</p>, <p><em>Hmm, how do I get up there?</em></p>, <p>I had used magic to open the door, but there was nothing to grab or hang onto.</p>, <p>The ceiling was quite high, and the length of the vertical passage leading beyond that door was also quite long.</p>, <p>In the game…it was a matter of “timing continuous jumps with the arrival of the train”… But that wasn’t a viable solution now, and lingering here was pointless.</p>, <p>[Dancing Flames]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>, <p>A beautifully glowing magical fireball rose at my command.</p>, <p>Considering the space above the door…</p>, <p><em>It’s quite high. If you add it all up, it’s about 10 meters?</em></p>, <p>There was no ladder or anything similar around. To move that distance in one go, I had to rely on magic.</p>, <p><em>[Levitation]…is out of the question, I need to get my hands on a first-order spell soon. There are plenty of highly efficient spells like [Leap], right?</em></p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>The train was approaching.</p>, <p><em>Jump until the train arrives…!</em></p>, <p>Should I really do this? Just when I was wondering that, I detected something I hadn’t known before through the magic lines I had spread out in all directions to detect the secret door.</p>, <p><em>There’s a magic circle in front of the train!</em></p>, <p>There was no mistaking it. A powerful repulsion spell was cast at the front of the train. If I timed my jump right, the spell’s effect would catapult me right to the ceiling!</p>, <p>In the game, it worked by “accidentally jumping at the right time”, but now, with an intelligence of 30, I had an almost supernatural ability to calculate the best moment and angle for the jump instantly. However, the problem was…</p>, <p><em>I understand the theory, but can this body of mine really time it right?</em></p>, <p>The train was approaching. There wasn’t much time left.</p>, <p>“Ah, shit.”</p>, <p>Well, whatever.</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p>[Lightning]</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p><em>Crackle-</em></p>, <p>For me, Kim Shin-hwa, who was usually a semi-idler engrossed in games and at most dabbled in occasional freelance work, it was an inconceivable and bizarre method.</p>, <p>With [Lightning], I carefully channeled electricity through different parts of my body to artificially induce muscle reflex actions, while [Arrow of Destruction] was fired at the ground to create a rebound force. The fine adjustments and trajectory corrections for the leap were managed by the magical telekinetic power of [Invisible Hand]!</p>, <p>My body moved at high speed. The leap, contact with the train, and then…</p>, <p><em>Flash-!</em></p>, <p>The effect of the magic circle attached to the train activated, leading to an extraordinary leap.</p>, <p>In an instant, the scenery around me transformed, and I found myself being catapulted upwards through the passage in the ceiling, just as I had intended.</p>, <p>It may sound simple when described, but it required an almost supernatural level of concentration and calculation ability, along with the skill to manipulate magic at a split-second level.</p>, <p><em>To think that such precise, high-density magical manipulation is needed just to time a jump.</em></p>, <p>That’s how I reached the space above the ceiling. It would have been nice to land like a hero, but instead, I was flung like a piece of luggage while tumbling and rolling like trash.</p>, <p>The space beyond the secret door was wide, and I lay in the same position I’d been thrown, struggling to pull myself up.</p>, <p>“Ugh…”</p>, <p>A groan escaped my lips. My barely existent muscles were overexerted, and my thighs felt like they were about to burst.</p>, <p><em>But, like the last secret door… which came first?</em></p>, <p>Is it the chicken or the egg?</p>, <p>Did someone install secret doors and cast spells on the train to artificially replicate bugs from the game of [Cthulhu World]?</p>, <p>Or did the game of [Cthulhu World] develop bugs in the process of replicating its real-world secret locations?</p>, <p><em>Maybe I can figure it out later by testing the money duplication bug or the NPC conversation glitch?</em></p>, <p>But for now, I needed to move.</p>, <p>I struggled to steady my trembling legs as I stood up. Something like a staff would be helpful right now… like a mage’s staff, right?</p>, <p>[Dancing Flames]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh-</em></p>, <p>Four magical fireballs radiating only light and no heat appeared around my body.</p>, <p>As the light emerged, the surroundings became visible to my eyes. The interior was quite spacious.</p>, <p>Rough walls with exposed concrete. Bizarre and profane graffiti drawn in red which was unclear whether it was blood or paint.</p>, <p>Although it had an extremely bizarre shape, the place somehow evoked the image of a temple.</p>, <p>Chairs for congregants were lined up, and at the front, a wide altar was placed.</p>, <p>Indeed, this was a temple of sorts. Not a conventional one for wholesome faith, but a sinister temple for worshippers of the Cthulhu mythos.</p>, <p>A scenario was prepared where cultists would later gather here, summon mythical creatures, and cause a horrific arson incident at Unjeong Station.</p>, <p>But at this moment, there was no one here.</p>, <p><em>This is the crux of the trick. If you come before the event, there’s nobody around!</em></p>, <p>I walked towards the altar at the front.</p>, <p><em>What were their names again?</em></p>, <p>They were called the [Descendants of Fomalhaut], those dreadful pyromaniacs.</p>, <p>Engraved at the front of the altar was the symbol of the great ancient being they worshipped.</p>, <p>A master of great flames, the greatest vampire of fire.</p>, <p>The eternally burning wrathful flame residing far in Fomalhaut.</p>, <p>A fire demon who seemed to have attained godhood at the very moment of a supernova explosion.</p>, <p>The symbol of the [Living Flame].</p>, <p>A message indicating a temporary exemption from a sanity check appeared and then vanished. For the faint-hearted, merely glimpsing this symbol could have disturbed their minds, but it was no issue for me. Good.</p>, <p>As expected from cultists who worshiped the god of fire, the stone altar bore a tremendous amount of soot. They must have burned many sacrifices. This was something that you’d think people would do in basements with poor ventilation.</p>, <p>And behind the altar, there should be a small box…</p>, <p><em>Right. There it is.</em></p>, <p>There was a jewel box about the size of a first aid kit. Intricate patterns proclaiming the greatness of fire were delicately engraved on its surface. However, the crucial part was what lay inside the box.</p>, <p>[‘Essence of Fire’ has been obtained.]</p>, <p>[‘Red Dragon’s Orb’ has been obtained]</p>, <p>[‘Ring of Corrupted Flame’ has been obtained.]</p>, <p>The Essence of Fire served as a consumable used as a magic catalyst or as a material for magical items, while the Red Dragon’s Orb, an A-rank artifact, generated a protective flame barrier for its owner. Among the other items were miscellaneous trinkets, glass bottles, and some religious symbols without any magical effects, but these were not of much importance.</p>, <p>The most important item was the Ring of Corrupted Flame. This was an artifact I had obtained every time since I discovered that “bug”.</p>, <p>When viewed in reality, as opposed to just being a game icon, the item exhibited such artistic value that it warranted a discussion for its beautiful appearance.</p>, <p>It shimmered with a deep, bewitching red, like a ruby plucked from the eye of a demon.</p>, <p><em>Of course, it’s not for its stunning appearance that I’ve gone through all this trouble.</em></p>, <p>[Ring of Corrupted Flame (S-rank Accessory): An evil ring forged from the flames of Fomalhaut. Infused with the power and curse of the corrupted flame.</p>, <p>Bearer of the Torch: Forces a sanity check when worn. Failure in this check embeds ‘Mental Illness — Pyromania’ into your mind.</p>, <p>Burning Madness: On failing the sanity check, there’s a certain chance that the curse of the corrupted flame manifests.</p>, <p>Red Elemental Focus: Increases the effect of all fire-type magic by 50%.</p>, <p>Incarnation of Fire: Strength +3</p>, <p>Legacy of Fire Knowledge: Increases understanding of ‘fire-type magic’.</p>, <p>…….]</p>, <p><em>Great, Strength +3!</em></p>, <p>In addition to its main feature, it was an S-rank accessory equipped with a myriad of diverse extra abilities.</p>, <p>Moreover, the ‘Legacy of Fire Knowledge’ effect had a bug. Instead of just enhancing the understanding of fire-type magic, it allowed certain spells of the fire category to be cast regardless of their order.</p>, <p>I carefully stored away the Essence of Fire and the Red Dragon’s Orb in my pocket, and after taking a deep breath, I put on the ring.</p>, <p>[You have worn the ring of the great ancient being residing in Fomalhaut. Blessings to those who have faith, and eternal damnation of fire to those without faith! The great will of fire targets your mind. That being…]</p>, <p>Aaah…. what an exhilaration. I disregarded the cascading content of the message window and tried moving my limbs. Indeed, a level of vitality and warmth that was incomparable to before enveloped my body.</p>, <p><em>But now, my strength is only at 8…</em></p>, <p><em>Haah</em>. There was still a mountain to climb.</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated. The outcome of your sanity check is changed to a success.]</p>, <p>Is it over now?</p>, <p>If I had failed the sanity check here, I would have acquired ‘Mental Illness — Pyromania’ and embarked on an exciting path of crime but as I expected, ‘Madness of the Abyss’ intervened this time as well.</p>, <p>“Ugh… it’s time to leave.”</p>, <p>A normal exit could be seen on the wall opposite the altar. However, that door couldn’t be used for leaving. Beyond it was an elevator, which led to a building owned by the cultists.</p>, <p>It was a terrible building filled with cultists disguised as ordinary people.</p>, <p>If I hadn’t used that trick to enter as I did now, I would have had to face an enormous number of cultists.</p>, <p>I headed towards the exit through which I had entered through to the altar.</p>, <p>[Achievement Unlocked!

            "[<p>[Flame Eruption]</p>, <p><em>Pahaaaaak!</em></p>, <p><em>– Guooooo!</em></p>, <p>Flames erupted in all directions. The “one who lost his form” creature, with its body made from grotesque tentacles and mucus, writhed and convulsed.</p>, <p>“It’s definitely different!”</p>, <p>The spell I used was actually a second-order spell. It was a whole different level of power compared to the zero-order spells I had manipulated to somehow create firepower.</p>, <p>This was all thanks to the effect of the [Ring of Corrupted Flame]. The ring allowed me to activate spells stored within it while ignoring their hierarchical order.</p>, <p>[The spells stored in the Ring of Corrupted Flame are as follows:</p>, <p>Second Order: ‘Flame Eruption’</p>, <p>Third Order: ‘Fireball’, ‘Burning Spear’]</p>, <p>Yes, exactly three.</p>, <p>When I infused my tremendous magical power, even zero-order spells could perform almost at the same level as third-order ones.</p>, <p>So if we were to do simple calculations, then that would mean a second-order spell should nearly have the same firepower as a fifth-order spell.</p>, <p>I was overwhelmed by the spell’s might and momentarily lost my focus. The one who lost… Ah, such a cumbersome name. Henceforth, you shall be known simply as the tentacle monster!</p>, <p>The tentacle monster began to swell its body, and that was not the end of it.</p>, <p>It had the ability to create parts of other creatures from its own body.</p>, <p>Horns, claw-like talons, and bizarre beast hooves sprouted as legs.</p>, <p>They are all deadly parts that could be used as weapons. The monster then charged at me with ferocious hostility.</p>, <p>“Hey there! Where did you get those fancy tricks?”</p>, <p>I poured my magical power into the surrounding flames.</p>, <p><em>Puhaaaaak!</em></p>, <p>The intensified flames now exerted a physical force beyond mere heat.</p>, <p><em>– Guooooo!</em></p>, <p>Another scream echoed from the monster. The flames pushed back and burned the grotesque appendages of the tentacle monster.</p>, <p>The appendages that came into contact with the flames went far beyond just burning and they turned to ash almost instantly.</p>, <p><em>But that thing…</em></p>, <p>Unlike the exposed appendages, the mucus wrapped around its body didn’t catch fire.</p>, <p><em>It has resistance to fire, no, resistance to magic in general.</em></p>, <p>Ugh…. how annoying… And isn’t it getting bigger?</p>, <p>It was clearly about the size of a crouched human in the beginning.</p>, <p>But now, it had grown to the size of two vans put together.</p>, <p>It wasn’t that cramped a space, but now it was uncomfortably large.</p>, <p>“Surely… it’s not going to just keep swelling up and crush me, is it?”</p>, <p>Its resistance wasn’t as big as [Fire Immunity]. The parts directly exposed to flames were boiling and shrinking after all.</p>, <p><em>Then I’ll just push it with overflowing magical power!</em></p>, <p>A ball of flame with explosive properties was formed between my outstretched hands.</p>, <p>After concentrating it a bit more to gather firepower… Take this!</p>, <p>“Move it, you fu*ker!”</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p>In French, that’s a boule de feu!</p>, <p><em>Whoosh! Boom!</em></p>, <p>The intensely concentrated fireball was more powerful than expected.</p>, <p>The creature caught in the explosion had its sprouting tentacles and appendages completely torn off and slammed into the wall.</p>, <p><em>– Guooooo!</em></p>, <p>Though it had such a bizarre shape, it seemed capable of feeling something akin to pain.</p>, <p>The creature began to thrash violently while emitting an emotional roar.</p>, <p><em>Tough one, isn’t it? Can I increase the firepower? Or do I need to find a way to remove that mucus?</em></p>, <p>The mucus was the problem. The attack was powerful even by my standards, but the mucus covering its body halved the damage.</p>, <p>I could pour in more magical power, but… Wait, what is that thing doing?</p>, <p>The tentacle monster started to wrap its tentacles in the flame-resistant mucus, pulling most of its mass upwards.</p>, <p>Quite clever. But that shape… Looks almost like a hammer…</p>, <p>“Eek!”</p>, <p>The tentacle monster transformed its body into a hammer-like shape and began to recklessly slam its massive bulk down.</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>The attack was made in a tremendous speed that not even a master could dodge. If the magical hand hadn’t flung me aside, I would have been hit directly and killed.</p>, <p>Rolling on the ground, my view flipped this way and that.</p>, <p>“Wow! You really do pack a punch!”</p>, <p>Ugh… My whole body aches. I feel like throwing up. Ugh, I’ve wasted too much time. I need to prepare for the next attack…</p>, <p>However, its attack was aimed completely elsewhere.</p>, <p><em>Bang! Boom! Bang!</em></p>, <p>“Hey, stop, you beast!”</p>, <p>Something felt off, and then I realized that the hammer it made wasn’t attacking me but the floor.</p>, <p>Is it trying to escape the flames by breaking into a larger space?</p>, <p>That’s not the main issue. There’s a subway line beneath us. Just the floor collapsing could cause a disaster.</p>, <p><em>Crack, crackle, snap-.</em></p>, <p>The floor was caving in, causing serious ruptures. Stop it already!</p>, <p>Right, if the problem was the mucus surrounding the body, then I should just burn its insides.</p>, <p>[Burning Spear]</p>, <p>A spear made of condensed flames rose up in the air. It wasn’t just simple heat; this was a spell with sharp physical force capable of piercing through the enemy.</p>, <p>This alone won’t be powerful enough, will it? If there’s not enough power, just increase it.</p>, <p>I infused more magical power into the completed spell to strengthen it.</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p><em>Swoosh- Bam!</em></p>, <p>Three newly formed spears joined the fray, making a total of four burning spears that soared toward the monster.</p>, <p>The spears of flames easily pierced through the mucus’s magical resistance.</p>, <p><em>– Grrraaaah!</em></p>, <p>How about that? Can’t move, can you? What can you do with spears stuck in your body?</p>, <p>Unable to move its body, the tentacle monster began its last desperate struggle, rapidly growing various appendages from its body.</p>, <p>Grotesque appendages sprouted: human legs, frog feet, bird wings, pink tendrils, monkey arms, goat hooves, severely curved chicken toes, plant stems, deer antlers, sharp insect legs, an elephant’s trunk, a rat’s tail, lion legs, fish fins, and eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs.</p>, <p>Hundreds and thousands of eyeballs shimmered with madness as they stared at me. Crazy, what is this madness?</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated.]</p>, <p>Ah, so it was trying a kind of mental attack just now? Sorry, but my mind is specially made, so that won’t work on me.</p>, <p>“Alright. Let’s end this now.”</p>, <p>I spread more magical power into the still-active burning spears.</p>, <p>The burning spear that adopted the new attribute vibrated unstably while emitting intense light.</p>, <p>“Explode!”</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>As expected, this is the standard for dealing with an enemy that relies on its “shell”. Its mucus might block magical attacks from the outside, but how can it stop an explosion from within?</p>, <p>The tentacle monster’s body parts were utterly destroyed, scattering in all directions or completely evaporating under the intense heat of the explosion.</p>, <p>A black magic stone, which could be said to be its core, rolled out from among the completely destroyed pieces.</p>, <p><em>Oh, a black one.</em></p>, <p>It wasn’t a commonly seen color for a magic stone. This was a high-quality stone with high purity.</p>, <p>The moment I picked up the magic stone, a new message appeared in the air.</p>, <p>[You have foiled the plan of the descendants of Formhalhaut, who sought to summon the god of fire at Unjeong Station!

And If I take into account the item bonuses, I could even surpass 60.</p>, <p><em>Time to head out. Oh, but wait…</em></p>, <p>Huh? What’s that?</p>, <p>I noticed something unusual on the ground. A tiny amount of slime, barely a handful, was still wriggling with life.</p>, <p>Such incredible vitality. It wasn’t completely dead after all?</p>, <p>I hadn’t seen anything like this in the game… Oh, wait, no. The [Wriggling Slime], perhaps?</p>, <p>It’s a material item that sometimes drops when you defeat a god’s servant. In the game, the material doesn’t actually wriggle; that’s why I didn’t immediately recognize it.</p>, <p>I couldn’t just leave behind an SS-rank high-quality material.</p>, <p>But unlike in the game, this thing… it’s moving quite violently, isn’t it?</p>, <p>As I increased my magical power to expand my vision, I began to see the magical particles and their flows scattered around me in more detail. When I shifted my gaze toward the slime fragment, its internal structure and components became clearly visible.</p>, <p><em>This one…. It’s more than just an item; it’s a living creature. Unlike in the game, carrying it around could result in it eating my flesh.</em></p>, <p>However, I couldn’t just leave behind such a high-quality SS-rank material.</p>, <p>I returned to the box behind the altar and took out a glass bottle. I spent some time pouring magical power into it.</p>, <p>With a bit of focus, soon a dazzling magic circle, glowing with fluorescent light, was engraved on the surface of the bottle. The magic circle wasn’t made of hexagrams and circles but was composed of geometrically drawn patterns and a few characters. It looked somewhat… like graffiti?</p>, <p>Anyway, once the tuning of the bottle was complete, I placed the slime inside. I wondered if I was carrying a bomb for a moment, but what harm could a creature stripped of its magic stone do?</p>, <p>The slime, now trapped in the glass bottle, displayed an interesting trick of creating a few eyes and teeth. However, as the magic circle installed in the bottle began to operate, it lost its activity and turned into a small marimo-like lump.</p>, <p><em>Neat! Sleep well now!</em></p>, <p>Alright. Time to meet Tudor.</p>, <p>I jumped down through the hole that led to the train rails.</p>, <p>It was the same hole I had made quite a fuss climbing up before, but now there was no need for that.</p>, <p>[Feather Fall]</p>, <p>The spell countered gravity’s pull and it slowed my fall.</p>, <p>There are many useful spells in the first order that can be applied in various situations.</p>, <p>I soon landed softly on an empty railroad track.</p>, <p>It wasn’t even evening yet, but I was starting to feel tired.</p>, <p>I had overexerted myself back at the Unjeong Station.</p>, <p>Ugh… I couldn’t afford to waste another day. I had to meet Tudor today.</p>, <p><em>Why? Because… I’m really strapped for cash…</em></p>, <p>I had spent a considerable amount of money on the taxi fare, meals, and purchasing clothes and a mask.</p>, <p>Now, after having my evening meal, I would be left with just enough money to spend a night in a really cheap motel.</p>, <p>Of course, there was the magic stone I obtained from killing the tentacle monster… or rather, the one who lost his form.</p>, <p>If I managed to sell this stone, I could easily make several million won in an instant.</p>, <p>However, selling it safely required some effort and legwork.</p>, <p>I didn’t want to deal with the ruthless illegal money changers who, under the guise of service fees, would take a whopping 40–60% cut.</p>, <p>Plus, if luck wasn’t on my side, I could get tangled up with shady characters which would lead to assaults or robberies.</p>, <p>In the end, regardless of what I acquire in the future, having connections is essential for disposing of it safely and effectively.</p>, <p>In addition, I was in search of someone who could also provide me with jobs…”Tudor”, the person I was on my way to meet operated as an underground broker of sorts.</p>, <p>For the purpose of visiting Tudor’s place of business, I traveled to Geumchon Station which was two stops away from Unjeong Station.</p>, <p><em>Walking along the main road, once I see Haknyeongsan Mountain… Oh, there it is.</em></p>, <p>Haknyeongsan Forest Park is a modest hill rising in the middle of Paju city. Halfway up the mountain, you could see the huge building of Haknyeongsan Temple and the huge brass-seated Buddha statue in its courtyard.</p>, <p>The giant 20-meter Buddha statue, erected as if looking down upon the city, was radiating a vivid yellow light in the sunlight.</p>, <p><em>What a magnificent sight…</em></p>, <p>My destination was not Haknyeongsan Temple though. It merely served as a reference point for navigation.</p>, <p>And for the time being, I had no need to encounter the fake monks of Haknyeongsan temple.</p>, <p>Indeed, it was more comfortable to avoid them as much as possible.</p>, <p>Unless I took an unusual route, I wouldn’t likely encounter them again until I escaped from this world.</p>, <p>I deliberately turned my head and headed towards the gloomy back alley where Tudor was located.</p>, <p>It was a shabby alley clustered with motels, rundown diners, cheap one-room buildings, and outdated karaoke signs, along with buildings conducting business illegally without even a sign.</p>, <p>On the surface, it seemed like a dirty neighborhood neglected by urban development, but once you entered the alley, you could feel the thrilling magic and the faint scent of danger.</p>, <p>It was a problem that I was wearing a mask, but a bigger issue was my magical power that couldn’t be completely hidden.</p>, <p>Though I tried to suppress it as much as possible, the sheer amount was so absurd that complete concealment was still impossible.</p>, <p>Professionals hidden in the alley and buildings were surely on guard because of me.</p>, <p>After wandering through the twisted alleys several times… a clean café painted in bright colors that did not fit with the image of the lifeless neighborhood appeared.</p>, <p>The signboard with ‘Café Vasilisa’ written on it was well-maintained and gleamed brightly.</p>, <p>The café wasn’t really out of business, but it was all a disguise.</p>, <p>Intense magical power flowed from within the café. It was a different caliber of power, even in this Geumcheon alley full of professionals from various fields.</p>, <p>There was no need to hesitate. Nothing there could influence or frighten me now.</p>, <p>Without stopping, I immediately opened the door to the café and entered.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Café Vasilisa was a spacious café with a noticeably clean interior compared to the streets it was on.</p>, <p>At first glance, the customers occupying the seats appeared to be ordinary people who were engaging in small talk over cups of coffee.</p>, <p><em>Everyone here is hiding something.</em></p>, <p>Most were concealing weapons or concealing their magical powers. They were all professionals connected to Tudor in some way.</p>, <p>A bulky man who was scooping up parfait at a table near the door noticed me and smirked before he turned to speak to a gloomy woman seated opposite him.</p>, <p>“Looks like we’ve got a new di*khead today.”</p>, <p>“Yeah, Tudor will be pleased.”</p>, <p>There was no need to pay attention to such petty squabbles. Fighting here would yield no benefit.</p>, <p>Since I showed no particular reaction, their interest quickly waned.</p>, <p>That was to be expected. Wearing a mask might hold people’s attention in any other place, but not in this café.</p>, <p>Here, there were people even more bizarre than me.</p>, <p>Just look at that man taking orders at the counter!</p>, <p>His body was clearly human. He was an attractive guy with a nice, well-toned body that would remind you of a model or PT trainer.</p>, <p>He dresses well, too. He was neatly dressed in a white dress shirt and tight black apron.</p>, <p>But his head!</p>, <p>On his head wasn’t a human head but a large, old-fashioned CRT monitor.</p>, <p>And the monitor on his head was actually functioning properly.</p>, <p>Displayed on it was a large, green dot graphic of a single eye that was moving around.</p>, <p>Though it seemed impossible for him to have vision in that eye, he often blinked or moved the eye image and he made “eye contact” with people.</p>, <p><em>No matter how unusual a mask I wear, I can’t top that.</em></p>, <p>Those unfamiliar with him might mistake it for headgear, but it was not merely a monitor worn over his head; it was actually his head.</p>, <p>His name was Orb.</p>, <p>Once you got to know the place a bit, you would learn that his name “Orb” actually came from “object head”.</p>, <p>I waited for a customer, who had been choosing a drink, to find a seat before approaching Orb to speak.</p>, <p>“I’m here to see Tudor.”</p>, <p>I knew where Tudor was, but bypassing Orb and going straight there would displease Tudor so this step was unavoidable.</p>, <p>The monitor-headed Orb twitched momentarily, then rolled the eyeball in the large eye image displayed on his monitor. Was he trying to be cute…?</p>, <p>Depending on your actions with Orb here, you could unlock various responses and small but entertaining events.</p>, <p>But I had already enjoyed the story of [Cthulhu World] enough as a game, so that was fine. I needed money immediately.</p>, <p>“Hey, Orb. I’m looking for work that a mage can do.”</p>, <p>Upon hearing his name, Orb displayed a large [!] on his monitor.</p>, <p>Then he opened his mouth… well, he doesn’t have one. Anyway, he emitted a strangely truncated synthetic voice from somewhere around his face.</p>, <p><em>-Go. Over. There.</em></p>, <p>As he said this, he extended his hand to point to a corner of the café.</p>, <p>A [☞] symbol also appeared on his monitor screen.</p>, <p>In the direction he pointed, there was a space hidden behind several large potted plants.</p>, <p>In that secluded area was a white sofa bed, said to be made of monster leather, reserved for Tudor’s use only.</p>, <p>Tudor usually spends her time lounging around on that sofa bed.</p>, <p>As I approached the sofa bed, I saw Tudor as expected, half-reclining there as she read some boring novel.</p>, <p>She was clad in a dress with a wide fit and flowing decorations, not in a modern style but more reminiscent of a medieval witch’s attire.</p>, <p>There was even a tall pointed witch’s hat that was placed on the table beside the sofa.</p>, <p>This wasn’t just a costume.</p>, <p>Tudor was a witch. An original witch.</p>, <p>As I got closer, Tudor under her long red hair, tilted her pale face upwards to look at me.</p>, <p>Though it would have looked great if she was holding a wand in the hand that was not holding the novel, what she was holding in her hand now was not a wand but a long, ornately decorated tobacco pipe.</p>, <p>“This isn’t lit.”</p>, <p>She was referring to the pipe. She seemed to have noticed that my gaze was fixed on it.</p>, <p>“I know.”</p>, <p>“It’s a bit of an interesting… taste, isn’t it?”</p>, <p>Now she was talking about my mask. Tudor liked such things. That’s why she employed someone like Orb as a clerk.</p>, <p>As always, Tudor didn’t ask how I knew to come here. She seemed to always be aware of everything happening in the shop, even when she appeared to be just lounging around.</p>, <p>She must have already known about my conversation with Orb and that I had known Orb’s name from the start.</p>, <p>With a playful smile, Tudor put down her book and stood up from the sofa bed. She was… oh, much taller than I had expected.</p>, <p>In the game, it was hard to tell how tall someone was, but she was at least a head taller than me.</p>, <p>But that didn’t mean she was bulky or overly tall. There was no awkwardness or disproportion in Tudor’s physique.</p>, <p>Her body structure, starting from her limbs, was exceptionally well-proportioned.</p>, <p><em>I knew she was a character with a pretty in-game illustration, but seeing her in person, she’s really imposing… Is this the dignity of charm level 20?</em></p>, <p>This wasn’t just about being pretty or not. Charm up to level 18 falls within human limits, but at level 20, it’s almost like magic in itself.</p>, <p>Sure, she was beautiful, but this was beyond human limits.</p>, <p>So much so that…</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated]</p>, <p>It activated to protect my mind. But wait, that doesn’t make sense. She’s pretty, but she’s not a mythical creature, is she?</p>, <p>“Stop with the weird stuff. I’d like to be introduced to a job that requires a mage.”</p>, <p>With an exaggerated, almost theatrical gesture, Tudor shrugged as if she didn’t know what I was talking about and withdrew her [Charm] spell.</p>, <p>I often engaged in such antics in the game as well.</p>, <p>“You’re quick-witted, aren’t you? And possessing something like this… This is my first time seeing it… It makes me wonder how much power it contains.”</p>, <p>Tudor momentarily showed a surprised expression, then quickly smiled and licked her lips. It seemed like she was impressed with my magical power.</p>, <p><em>I bet she would be even more surprised if she knew I was suppressing most of my power.</em></p>, <p>My mana core contained a vast amount of magical power, more than I could comfortably handle.</p>, <p>I was doing my best to conceal my power, but given Tudor’s perceptiveness, she seemed to have some inkling that I was hiding my true strength.</p>, <p>“Well, alright. I have plenty of work for a mage like you. I’m Tudor. And your name is?”</p>, <p>“Kim Shin-hwa.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… It’s a good name, I suppose.”</p>, <p>Fixers don’t use their real names. Most of their work treads in semi-legal areas. They use nicknames, often referred to as “fixer names” and change them quickly if there’s any trouble.</p>, <p>But hearing a name like Kim Shin-hwa all of a sudden seemed absurd to her.</p>, <p>Without any identification, what difference did it make if a name was real or fake? If a name became problematic, I could simply change it.</p>, <p>For reference, my last warrior character was named Kim Shin-hwa 1788. If I had the chance to name the “mage gazing into the abyss” character, it probably would have been Kim Shin-hwa 1789.</p>, <p>“Okay, Kim Shin-hwa. It’s been a while since someone came to me like this without any introduction, so I’m a bit hesitant…”</p>, <p>Tudor tapped her cheek with her finger, trailing off. It was clear she was still uncertain about trusting me.</p>, <p>Originally, there would have been several choices to select from, and I could pick a pre-set dialogue… but now I had to speak for myself.</p>, <p><em>I should probably say something that got a good response before.</em></p>, <p>“I’d like to get to know you better, sooner rather than later.”</p>, <p>This was a way of saying I wanted a good job quickly. And before Tudor could say anything more, I continued.</p>, <p>“If you have any troublesome requests, I can handle them right away. Even those that have already cost a few fixers their lives.”</p>, <p>When I said that, Tudor’s face lit up with a playful expression as if she was wondering where such a character had sprung from.</p>, <p>“Quite an interesting taste you have there. A powerful mage like you would definitely be interesting, but I can’t just assign a big task right from the start. After all, this industry operates on credit and trust, you know?”</p>, <p>She spoke almost exactly as she would have in the game.</p>, <p>Although my words had appealed to Tudor, this was the kind of response expected to be given to someone either of low level or who had arrived without an introduction.</p>, <p>I hadn’t expected to receive a great task right from the start, so I wasn’t disappointed.</p>, <p>“The first and most important criterion is how trustworthy you are. Skill comes third.”</p>, <p>And the unspoken second criterion was “to be interesting enough to catch Tudor’s fancy”.</p>, <p>“Still, I can’t just turn away a mage like yourself. Alright, come this way. Let’s build trust and get to know each other slowly.”</p>, <p>With a smile, Tudor pulled back a curtain on one wall.</p>, <p>Beyond the curtain was a door marked “Staff Only”. Tudor explained that it led to her office and ushered me inside.</p>, <p>Now that I think about it, the office was a space that was not depicted back in the game…</p>, <p>Usually, at this point in the game, a close-up of Tudor would appear, followed by a dialogue box to click for tasks.</p>, <p>The first thing that caught my eye in Tudor’s office was the large mahogany desk at its center.</p>, <p>It was as big as two regular desks put together, cluttered with a messy array of papers and miscellaneous items.</p>, <p>Cleaning was Orb’s responsibility.</p>, <p>But seeing that the desk alone was in such a state, it seemed like Orb was not allowed to touch it.</p>, <p>Tudor dragged a chair from a corner of the room and seated me in it.</p>, <p>“Sit here. I have a feeling you’ll show something interesting. I’ll offer you a very favorable contract.”</p>, <p>No sooner had she finished speaking than a few sheets of paper scattered on the desk flew up and landed in front of me.</p>, <p>The contract was filled with long-winded prohibitions, clauses about non-interference with each other, and various other stipulations regarding confidentiality.</p>, <p>It was mostly a formality anyway, with nothing particularly noteworthy.</p>, <p>“Great, the contract is complete. I don’t know how you found out about this place, but you did well. Let’s get along well from here on.”</p>, <p>“I agree. And I’d like to get straight to business.”</p>, <p>“Hmm, I thought you might say that. Take a look at this.”</p>, <p>Tudor handed me a bounty hunting mission as an introductory task. The document she presented contained the personal details of a certain individual.</p>, <p>“A bounty hunt, then.”</p>, <p>“As I said before, I can’t entrust you with the type of work that directly connects you to the client until you prove sufficient trust.”</p>, <p>A bounty hunt boils down to simply capturing the target and delivering them.</p>, <p>There’s no need to interact with clients, and if I fail, they can simply send someone else.</p>, <p>This makes bounty hunting a good task to be assigned as a test, which is why it’s typically the first assignment given, regardless of where you go.</p>, <p><em>Alright, the contract is signed… Somehow I made it this far.</em></p>, <p>Up to this point, I could control the situation.</p>, <p>Which broker to meet.</p>, <p>What kind of contract to sign.</p>, <p>But which target Tudor would assign was random.</p>, <p>If you think outside the game logic, it’s understandable.</p>, <p>Tudor must be constantly managing people, so depending on when I arrived, the available bounties would vary.</p>, <p>In short, it was like a bounty gacha.</p>, <p>It was a gacha where the difficulty level changed depending on who was chosen. I hoped it would be an easy one…</p>, <p>Looking at the photo attached to the document, I recognized a familiar face.</p>, <p>It was a man with a dragonfly tattoo under his eye and he looked to be wildly excited as if the photo was taken right after he took some hallucinogen.</p>, <p>“His name is Lee Chang-hyuk. His occupation… he claims to be a rocker or a singer, but in reality, he’s just a guy who occasionally performs in bars. His main job is closer to that of a fixer or a thug. He even has a fixer name; was it Victor?”</p>, <p>Of course, I had never met him in real life. But I had encountered him often in the game.</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk was almost a dud in terms of the gacha.</p>, <p>Seeing my grimace as I read the document, Tudor seemed to misunderstand and smiled as if amused.</p>, <p>“Right. He’s got the skills to survive in the back alleys.”</p>, <p>“…that’s not a problem.”</p>, <p>Since I couldn’t tell Tudor that I knew Lee Chang-hyuk from the game, I answered by pretending to look at the part of the document where Lee Chang-hyuk’s specifications were written.</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk’s abilities were nothing special. To me now, he was just “a guy called Chang-hyuk” nothing more. There were two reasons why he was a problem.</p>, <p>“He was hired by a company called Helistic to escort a research sample. Turns out, it wasn’t just any item, but an artifact smuggled in from a special region. Bold as he is, he swallowed it and fled. That’s why he’s now a target.”</p>, <p>Helistic is a biotech company that develops things like cancer treatments. In Paju, they had several research projects including Helistic’s headquarters. One of them was… the [K-3675 Secret Research Facility] I escaped from.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>This was the first reason why this request was inevitably doomed to fail. While Helistic outwardly posed itself as a legitimate corporation, it was one of the malevolent entities steeped in the Cthulhu mythos’s madness.</p>, <p>Becoming entangled with these people wouldn’t pose an immediate problem, but depending on the route, I might end up fighting Helistic until the game’s conclusion.</p>, <p>“If this is a request from a company, it won’t just be one or two guys chasing after him, right? When was the bounty issued?”</p>, <p>This was the second reason why Lee Chang-hyuk was a dud.</p>, <p>The real serious issue was that finding Lee Chang-hyuk was simply a nuisance.</p>, <p>If luck was not on my side, I could waste days in vain.</p>, <p>Moreover, this quest had a time limit.</p>, <p>If about 15 days had already passed since a bounty was put on his head, he would successfully smuggle himself out on a ship from Incheon.</p>, <p><em>No, but usually the time limit starts after you receive the request, right? What kind of quest has a timer running before you even accept it? No wonder they call it a failed game.</em></p>, <p>Therefore, depending on how many days have already passed, there might be no way to resolve this task.</p>, <p>“He’s been quite successful at evading capture so far. Today marks exactly two weeks since he fled.”</p>, <p>Holy shit.</p>, <p>“Exactly 14 days? Or is it about that long?”</p>, <p>When I leaned in to ask again, Tudor gave me a puzzled look. This was only natural since she wouldn’t have considered the existence of a time limit.</p>, <p>Tudor paused for a moment, then rifled through the documents.</p>, <p>“Um… yes, today is exactly the 14th day since then. Midnight tonight will mark the 15th day.”</p>, <p><em>What now?</em></p>, <p>At this point, requesting something else would cause Tudor to lose interest in me.</p>, <p>While it wouldn’t mean I would get no work at all, I would likely only receive the leftovers, the scraps of jobs others had passed on.</p>, <p>So, to establish a stable connection with Tudor, it was better to proceed as planned.</p>, <p>“What about the reward?”</p>, <p>In truth, there wasn’t much more I was curious about. The reward would probably be the same as mentioned in the game.</p>, <p>However, I couldn’t just not ask about it.</p>, <p>If a new fixer who just signed a contract appeared to know everything about a request from the start, it could arouse unnecessary suspicion.</p>, <p>Tudor looked at my mask for a moment and then continued.</p>, <p>“Five million for Lee Chang-hyuk’s head. And twenty-five million for retrieving the artifact he has.”</p>, <p>“It’s a subtly low price.”</p>, <p>And the balance of the amounts was almost laughable.</p>, <p>“They don’t want to spend too much on such a small fry. That’s why he hasn’t been caught yet. If they raised the bounty by just two million more, skilled guys would swoop in and snatch him up, right?”</p>, <p>This was exactly like the dialogue in the game. In the game, it was just text without voice acting, but hearing it in Tudor’s languid voice gave it a new feel. His high charisma really did make a difference.</p>, <p>“Alright. I’ll take it on.”</p>, <p>[You’ve accepted the quest!</p>, <p>&lt;Bounty Quest: Hunting Lee Chang-hyuk&gt;</p>, <p>Capture “Lee Chang-hyuk” who stole a sample destined for a Helistic subsidiary’s laboratory, and retrieve the “Artifact: Security Bag Containing the Test Subject” he took.</p>, <p>! Time Limit: Lee Chang-hyuk will escape Korea via Incheon in (1) day !</p>, <p>Reward: 50,000XP (+ the monetary reward promised by the broker is separate.) Failure: Tudor will be disappointed.]</p>, <p><em>The quest window appears even when for bounty requests.</em></p>, <p>I remember when I hovered the mouse cursor over the reward section back in the game, a message popped up saying, “Gaining the broker’s favor can lead to more rewards”.</p>, <p>“By any chance, Tudor, can you see this?”</p>, <p>I asked Tudor if she could see the message window just in case.</p>, <p>“Do you have any other symptoms… apart from that?”</p>, <p>No, that’s not what I meant…</p>, <p>Despite my attempts to clear up Tudor’s misunderstanding with several explanations, none of them worked out.</p>, <p>Eventually, I gave up on trying to correct Tudor’s misunderstanding and left her office.</p>, <p>However, I couldn’t depart right away.</p>, <p>There were things I needed to prepare.</p>, <p>I borrowed a pair of scissors from Orb and settled at a secluded table in the café.</p>, <p>Tudor was sitting right opposite me at the table as she watched my actions. She leaned her chin on her hands clasped together, completely relaxed… Is she finding this amusing?</p>, <p>“What if a seizure suddenly starts? That would be serious, wouldn’t it?”</p>, <p>Tudor wore a warm expression as if she understood everything about me. What does she understand? She’s a witch.</p>, <p>Thanks to Tudor, the gazes of other fixers hanging around in the café were also drawn to me.</p>, <p>Ignore them, just ignore them. I pulled out the straitjacket I was wearing previously from my backpack.</p>, <p>Then, using the scissors, I cut off the dangling straps from the straitjacket.</p>, <p>Was dexterity influenced by my agility stat? With a mere agility of 8, which was not helpful for this task, it took longer than expected.</p>, <p>Tudor burst into laughter when she saw that one of the straps had turned almost into rags.</p>, <p>Haah… Just bear with it…</p>, <p>Eventually, after much effort, I managed to produce six intact straps and two that were nearly tattered.</p>, <p>The straitjacket also ended up almost like a rag, but I stuffed it into my backpack anyway.</p>, <p>“Why don’t you just “whoosh- bang!” and capture him? You’re a mage, aren’t you?”</p>, <p>“…Then the artifact would be damaged too.”</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk was a superhuman who developed special abilities due to a condition called magical power hypertrophy.</p>, <p>Thanks to that, he possessed several special abilities along with a decent level of magical resistance.</p>, <p>If the request had been “capture and kill”, I could have approached him without much thought and finished him off with a single blow.</p>, <p>However, spells like that usually come with excessively flashy effects. To safely recover the artifact he possessed required some careful planning.</p>, <p>I thought about buying some rope, but where was the money to waste like that? There were plenty of things here to tie with.</p>, <p>Tudor, laughing heartily again, bid me farewell with words expressing her anticipation about what shape I would return in.</p>, <p>Yeah, laugh all you want. Today will be the last day I play the pauper.</p>, <p>I started by walking and searching through the Geumchon neighborhood.</p>, <p>I had played countless bounty quests and never failed to capture a target.</p>, <p>Ideally, it would have been better if Lee Chang-hyuk had a fixed hideout, but he was designed as a roaming-type criminal to keep the veteran players from getting bored.</p>, <p>That doesn’t mean he roamed aimlessly. If that were the case, I would have just given up.</p>, <p>He didn’t stay in a fixed location but appeared randomly at six different sites.</p>, <p>The patterns of his appearances changed over time, so he could reappear at a place I had already checked, making him an especially troublesome target.</p>, <p><em>Oh, I don’t want to walk!</em></p>, <p>Once I collect the bounty and stabilize my finances, I should get some mode of transportation. The penalty trait [Weakened Stamina] makes my body feel drained after just a short walk.</p>, <p>But at least the first spot was relatively close.</p>, <p>I looked up at a dirty building. It was a bar without a sign that operated in the back alleys of the Geumchon neighborhood.</p>, <p>According to the setup, it was Lee Chang-hyuk’s favorite bar, and inside were many delinquents who were on friendly terms with him.</p>, <p>Entering meant that regardless of whether Lee Chang-hyuk was there or not, a big brawl was likely to break out.</p>, <p>“Fortunately, I won’t need to go that far.”</p>, <p>I leaned my hand against the wall of the bar and gathered my magical power.</p>, <p>[Magical Power Detection]</p>, <p>Bright green lines of magic emanated from my fingertips and seeped into the building.</p>, <p>It was like watching tree roots made of neon signs burrow into the ground.</p>, <p><em>He’s not here.</em></p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk suffered from magical power hypertrophy. Since he never appeared with other people with special abilities, I could skip most of the unnecessary investigation with this simple detection spell.</p>, <p>I still had to visit each location in person, though…</p>, <p>It was just a race against time.</p>, <p>The day was already turning to dusk.</p>, <p><em>I need to resolve this quickly.</em></p>, <p>Thinking about Cthulhu-dimensional travel and other matters would have to wait.</p>, <p>To maintain my condition, I needed to wash, eat, and find a place to rest.</p>, <p>I had to catch Lee Chang-hyuk and get the money before the sun rose again.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Bingo.</p>, <p>I found him in the third spot.</p>, <p>My luck wasn’t entirely bad.</p>, <p>The place where the abnormal magical power unique to magical power hypertrophy was detected was a motel located on the outskirts of the Gwangtan neighborhood.</p>, <p>It was a relief to find him here; otherwise, I would have had to travel much farther.</p>, <p>Once the location was pinpointed, the rest was in my control. His hiding spot was room 304, and my entry methods included breaking down the door, negotiating with the motel owner, entering through a window, or…</p>, <p>“Delivery~.”</p>, <p>This was the simplest method and the timing was perfect.</p>, <p>Lying in wait at the motel, there’s usually a moment when he’d briefly step out to collect ordered food. That’s the ideal time for a surprise attack.</p>, <p>Even though the deliveryman arrived, Lee Chang-hyuk didn’t open the door and merely replied back.</p>, <p>“Just leave it there.”</p>, <p>“Enjoy your meal.”</p>, <p>What did he order? It seems like a soup dish. I’m hungry already; maybe I’ll eat it after dealing with him?</p>, <p>The deliveryman left the food and went on his way, but the door remained closed for a long time. He was likely being cautious.</p>, <p>With [Magical Power Detection] still active, I could clearly see what he was up to.</p>, <p>He was pressed up against the door, probably listening for sounds from outside.</p>, <p>Fine, I’ll stay quiet. Come on out.</p>, <p><em>Click.</em></p>, <p>The sound of the lock opening. This is it. I prepared my spell, timing it with the sound.</p>, <p>Creak…</p>, <p><em>Good. Now!</em></p>, <p>[Magic Bullet]</p>, <p>I hurled a bullet of magical energy through the slightly ajar door.</p>, <p><em>Crash</em>!</p>, <p>“Aargh!”</p>, <p>The door that was hit was completely shattered, and the impact sent Lee Chang-hyuk tumbling backward.</p>, <p><em>Crash!</em></p>, <p>He rolled over and scrambled into the room. Ah, trying to grab his bag, I see?</p>, <p>“Hey there~, Lee Chang-hyuk~!”</p>, <p>I deliberately moved slowly as I entered his room.</p>, <p>Sure, leaping in might look impressive, but with this body, any hasty movement would just make me seem retarded.</p>, <p>Instead, it is better to create a sense of fear leisurely.</p>, <p>As expected, Lee Chang-hyuk was holding a large bag in one hand. It was a large silver bag reinforced with metal.</p>, <p>That must be the security bag containing the test subject. In the game, it was just a quest item, so I couldn’t check its contents.</p>, <p>And his other hand was hidden inside his clothing. He’s concealing a handgun.</p>, <p>“What, what are you!”</p>, <p>“What do you think? Isn’t it obvious? Just hand over that bag, and I won’t hurt you.”</p>, <p>“Eh… hufffffff…”</p>, <p>He suddenly stopped talking and took a sharp breath.</p>, <p>His upper body swelled up to at least twice the size of an average person’s.</p>, <p>He might seem bizarre, but this was actually Lee Chang-hyuk’s attack stance.</p>, <p>Predicting his next move was simple. Now, to time it right!</p>, <p><em>One, two…</em></p>, <p>His mouth opened. Right now is the moment. Three!</p>, <p><em>– Kwaah!</em></p>, <p>An unbelievably loud sound erupted from his mouth, something no human should be able to produce.</p>, <p>But I too had completed my spell just as his mouth opened.</p>, <p><em>Whooosh!</em></p>, <p>A magic circle of light appeared right in front of me.</p>, <p>It distorted and twisted the sound waves coming from his mouth.</p>, <p>This was my own modified version of the zero-order spell, Transmission.</p>, <p>Should I name it something like [Sound Wave Distortion]?</p>, <p>It defied physical laws, twisting the direction of the sound.</p>, <p>Therefore, even though Lee Chang-hyuk, who had the condition of magical power hypertrophy, attacked me with his magical power through sound, no damage was inflicted on me!</p>, <p><em>Crash!</em></p>, <p>Instead, the walls on the left, right and bottom of the motel were shattered and scattered around.</p>, <p>“Shit! What is that! What did you just do?!”</p>, <p>Seeing his attack fail, he grimaced and let out a shout of frustration.</p>, <p>Still, he moved his hand quickly and took something out of his clothes.</p>, <p><em>Click.</em></p>, <p>It was a gun.</p>, <p>“Die!”</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk’s gun spat fire without hesitation.</p>, <p>Wow, that was quick! But then, this is how one survives in this world, isn’t it?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>But as I had expected everything up to this point, I just folded my arms and looked at him.</p>, <p><em>Bang! Bang! Ratatatatata!</em></p>, <p>A hail of bullets rained on me with a loud noise.</p>, <p>However, the bullets he fired flew towards the walls above, below, and to the sides, embedding themselves there much like the sound waves from before.</p>, <p><em>Click! Click!</em></p>, <p>The sound of the trigger pulling on empty chambers continued for a moment before stopping altogether.</p>, <p>“What… What is this even….”</p>, <p>This time, he looked so genuinely shocked and surprised that he paused in his actions.</p>, <p>An obvious opening! While I could use magic to knock him down… I decided to show a bit of kindness in return for his help in testing my spell effects.</p>, <p>“Sound wave distortion, followed by a distortion field. The former distorts your sounds; the latter distorts ranged attacks.”</p>, <p>“You… What are you? Who exactly are you….”</p>, <p>“Can’t you see? I’m a mage, aren’t I?”</p>, <p>“No, no! But why would a high-ranking mage like you care bout’ someone like me….”</p>, <p>I’m not exactly a high-ranking mage… But given that these spells were new to him, it was a fair assessment.</p>, <p>But my kindness ends here.</p>, <p>I extended my hand to summon a new spell. The time for explanations is over, now is the time to capture.</p>, <p>“[Lightning].”</p>, <p><em>Zapzapzapzap! Tszzzzzzzz!</em></p>, <p>A zero-order spell. Literally a spell to create electricity. Originally, it would just produce a spark, enough for an electric shock attack, but…</p>, <p>My powerful magical power caused the electricity blossoming from my hand to dance a dazzling dance, like the current of a Tesla coil.</p>, <p>“Holy shit!”</p>, <p>Seeing the raging white electric light, he finally snapped out of his daze, gritted his teeth, and crouched down.</p>, <p>I was blocking the door, so he had no escape.</p>, <p>Well, then.</p>, <p>If possible, don’t die; just faint…</p>, <p><em>Zapzapzap!</em></p>, <p>“Aaaargh!”</p>, <p>The searing white electricity struck him directly.</p>, <p>Even while screaming, the guy resisted by radiating magical power from his entire body.</p>, <p>So he endured it. Even though he was experiencing both pain and injury, somehow he held on. A tough one, isn’t he? Indeed, he has an extraordinary constitution. But… one more blast should do it.</p>, <p>“Ugh… Ugh… You think I’m going to die like this!”</p>, <p>“No. I don’t intend to kill you, so don’t die. Just come along quietly; it’s easier for both of us.”</p>, <p>“Ha! If I get dragged off by you to those guys, what do you think will happen to me? I’ll either be killed or turned into a subject test!!!”</p>, <p>“I know. Yet knowing that, why did you steal from that crazy company?”</p>, <p>“In that case… let’s die together, damn it!”</p>, <p>With that, he channeled magical power into his arm and hurled the bag he was holding.</p>, <p>Hey, if you’re doing that, it’s going to break…</p>, <p><em>Crack!</em></p>, <p>The bag was…completely destroyed.</p>, <p>From the shattered bag, a bizarre, milk-like white lump of flesh burst out.</p>, <p>The unpleasant lump, about the size of two fists stuck together, writhed in a strange manner.</p>, <p>In that fleeting moment,</p>, <p>Using my highly functional intelligence… I recalled what it was.</p>, <p>[Black goat’s body fluids].</p>, <p>No, damn it! Why is this appearing now?</p>, <p>The strange lump of flesh, moving fluidly in a sticky and flexible manner much like a slime, elicited a surge of confusion on Lee Chang-hyuk’s face as he witnessed it.</p>, <p>“W-what is this?”</p>, <p>“You idiot! You took it out without knowing what it was!?”</p>, <p>“What do you mean?!”</p>, <p>“Get rid of it quickly, idiot!”</p>, <p>But it was too late.</p>, <p>While that bastard Lee Chang-hyuk was dazedly wasting time, the white lump of flesh had leaped towards his face at an incredible speed.</p>, <p>The chunks of flesh quickly coalesced and covered Lee Chang-hyuk’s face.</p>, <p>A terrible scream escaped his mouth.</p>, <p>“Aaaargh!”</p>, <p>In an instant, the lump of flesh merged with Lee Chang-hyuk’s head, and many things changed rapidly. A horrific transformation began.</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk’s size grew, tearing his clothes apart.</p>, <p>The human form began to fade away, giving rise to the emergence of a beastly shape.</p>, <p>What should have been there disappeared, crumbled, and got mashed up.</p>, <p>What should have not been there appeared, sprouted, and blossomed.</p>, <p>Sturdy hooves emerged on reversed-jointed legs.</p>, <p>Brown fur sprouted all over his body, with his arms lengthening to reach his knees.</p>, <p>His face elongated into a beast-like snout, with bizarre, horizontally elongated pupils.</p>, <p>And a pair of large horns grew out of his forehead.</p>, <p>It was a bizarre figure as if the most horrifying aspects of a goat and a human were blended together.</p>, <p>This was the ominous and blasphemous form long thought by humans to be the shape of a devil.</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk had become a grotesque half-man, half-beast monster as if draped in the skin of a goat.</p>, <p>It was a sight of a human being crushed and transformed into a monster. Although I felt an unpleasant sensation creeping into my head, it soon disappeared.</p>, <p>The “madness of the abyss” trait protected my mind from the sight of this being.</p>, <p>A half-man, half-beast figure resembling a satyr or Satan in mythology.</p>, <p>They were the noble and supreme minions of the great Outer Gods.</p>, <p>Humans who had received blessings from the gods of another realm</p>, <p>A monster that can no longer be called human!</p>, <p>In [Cthulhu World], such beings were collectively known as [Mutants].</p>, <p>“You said you didn’t want to die, and yet, why have you abandoned your humanity?”</p>, <p>This was the blessing of a being from the abyss, [The Black Goat].</p>, <p>Its proper name was [The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young].</p>, <p>The queen of the dark forest,</p>, <p>The true mother of the earth,</p>, <p>The master of all life,</p>, <p>The one who walks behind the boundaries.</p>, <p>A powerful and renowned entity of the abyss, even among those of the Cthulhu mythos.</p>, <p>Although she could be called a goddess with powers over the creation and growth of life, she was not the kind of earth mother goddess we commonly imagine.</p>, <p>She was the mother of many monsters, creator of abominations. Her fluids imbued with her power could bestow new flesh and strength upon humans.</p>, <p>The transformation Lee Chang-hyuk was undergoing was precisely the blessing of the goddess of madness and fertility, Shub-Niggurath.</p>, <p>Simply put, her body fluids transformed humans into monsters.</p>, <p>“Gwaaaaar!”</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk, who was now a monster, howled in anguish.</p>, <p>Having grown to a height of over 2 meters, he rampaged forward with his horns leading the charge. Oh, was he going for another round?</p>, <p>He kicked off the ground with force and charged forward.</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>The floor kicked by the hooves caved in and he was launched into the air. A direct hit would surely shatter a human body into pieces, wouldn’t it?</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>Although I countered with three layers of overlapping protective circles, the impact was formidable.</p>, <p><em>Crack, crack, crack!</em></p>, <p>I could feel the protective circles buckling under the force. The outermost circle had already shattered into pieces.</p>, <p><em>Can I handle this at my current level?</em></p>, <p>My level was 10. To stand a chance against a mutant, one needed to be at least level 30.</p>, <p>Under normal circumstances, fleeing and assessing the situation would have been the best course of action. However, as the crisis suddenly arose, my mind calmed down.</p>, <p><em>Maybe I can do this?</em></p>, <p>My magical power couldn’t be measured by levels alone. This could actually be a good test.</p>, <p>As I poured more magical power into the weakening protective circle, I prepared a new spell.</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh! Boom!</em></p>, <p>A ball of flame erupted and exploded at close range. Lee Chang-hyuk was caught off guard by the sudden blast and was flung backward.</p>, <p>I felt a scorching heat flare up. Since my body had [Attribute Resistance — Fire], I wasn’t bothered much by the flames, but I was worried about my mask.</p>, <p>In my panic, I felt the mask slightly deformed by the sudden heat. Ah, damn it!</p>, <p>The damage to my mask was more horrifying than witnessing a person transform into a monster right before my eyes. My heart rate instantly quickened.</p>, <p>Yet, it was just a minor tension, not enough to trigger madness.</p>, <p>“Grrrr…”</p>, <p>Although his entire body’s fur was singed black, Lee Chang-hyuk seemed unhampered in his movements.</p>, <p><em>Did he gain fire resistance?</em></p>, <p>Fine, but he won’t be so lucky with other elements.</p>, <p>[Breath of Ra]</p>, <p>A yellowish stream of acidic vapor shot towards him.</p>, <p>He covered his face with his arms, but soon, various parts of his body were torn apart and he started bleeding profusely.</p>, <p>“Gwaah!”</p>, <p>Even amidst the agony of his flesh melting, he showed no sign of yielding. His intelligence, now reduced to the level of a wild animal, probably made him more aggressive.</p>, <p>He grabbed the nearby bed and hurled it at me.</p>, <p>My vision was momentarily obscured. But really, what was he trying to achieve by throwing a bed as if it were a boulder?</p>, <p>[Magic Bulllet]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>Glowing balls of magical power began to float around my body.</p>, <p>Small magic circles appeared on the palms of my hands to assist with the multiple calculations.</p>, <p>This was a basic spell, akin to what’s typically known as “Magic Missle” in fantasy games.</p>, <p>The spell was of average power but firing about thirty rounds made a big difference.</p>, <p><em>Bang, bang, bang, bang!</em></p>, <p>It felt like firing a multiple rocket launcher. A vast number of light trails shot through the air.</p>, <p><em>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!</em></p>, <p>The approaching bed was instantly pulverized in mid-air and the remaining bullets struck him.</p>, <p>“Gwaaaack!”</p>, <p>[Creation: Create Clear Water]</p>, <p>[Torrent]</p>, <p>With abundant magical power, even seemingly insignificant spells can become powerful weapons.</p>, <p>Water was created as if it were bursting from all directions and was shot toward the guy with overwhelming water pressure.</p>, <p><em>Boom, whoosh, splatter!</em></p>, <p>He tried to defend himself with his arms but they were quickly twisted and flung away.</p>, <p>His horns broke under the pressure and the room’s furnishings were destroyed.</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk could no longer scream but was swept away by the furious waves towards the wall.</p>, <p><em>Boom! Crack!</em></p>, <p>The moment Lee Chang-hyuk’s huge body and the massive wave collided, the motel’s exterior wall began to crack.</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>I had thought it was a rundown motel, but isn’t this too much!?</p>, <p><em>Crack, crash, boom!</em></p>, <p>Eventually, the wall couldn’t hold on any longer and collapsed, revealing the clear night sky.</p>, <p>The debris from the outer wall, a massive wave, and a gigantic half-human, half-beast monster cascaded down towards the bustling main street of Paju.</p>, <p>“Kyaaaah.”</p>, <p>“Waaah”</p>, <p>“Why did it have to be the wall facing the main road?”</p>, <p>Looking out the window, I saw chaos unfolding on the streets.</p>, <p>It was expected, considering a horned monster and an enormous amount of water had suddenly fallen from the sky, but the actual situation was even more problematic.</p>, <p>People were petrified with pale faces, some clawing at their own faces as if to tear them off, others screaming and clutching their heads, some rubbing their heads against the dirty asphalt, others running blindly into walls, a person suddenly vomiting and bending over, and one drawing a pistol and firing wildly in random directions.</p>, <p>The night streets of Paju were now filled with senseless madness and aimless cries.</p>, <p>I had always tried to resolve situations without causing such problems.</p>, <p>“Well, who would have thought the wall would collapse?”</p>, <p>The human mind is fragile.</p>, <p>Things that exist beyond reality leave a profound shock and terrible scars on the human psyche.</p>, <p>Something dark and heavy, yet hot and cold, burrows into the mind.</p>, <p>A nauseating, repulsive, unpleasant, and almost vomit-inducing sensation invades one’s thoughts.</p>, <p>Something alien, solid, bizarre, and terrifying pierces into the fragile human brain.</p>, <p>There’s a feeling of itchiness under the skin, a stinging sensation behind the eyeballs, an itch inside the skull.</p>, <p>Humans, unable to withstand such shocks and scars, undergo abnormal psychological disturbances in an attempt to protect themselves.</p>, <p>Even in a world where otherworldly beings, sinister mages, and bizarre mutants roamed the streets, such a thing still happened.</p>, <p>This was because the ominous presence emanating from transcendental beings battered the human soul and demanded forced awakening and enlightenment.</p>, <p>The monstrous mutants of the beyond, born from the power of the Great Black Goat, could destroy people’s minds with just their terrifying and ominous presence.</p>, <p><em>– Grrroooaaarrr!!</em></p>, <p><em>Crash! Boom! Bang!</em></p>, <p>Loud, resounding noises erupted from outside. Well, look at that! Even in such a state, it’s still going strong.</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk, who lost his will to fight after being hit by continuous magical assaults, began to run into the alley, letting out a destructive roar filled with magical power.</p>, <p>Though he had taken on a form closer to a beast, I could sense the fear he had towards me.</p>, <p>Now that things had come to this, I decided to deal with him as flamboyantly as possible.</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>I was definitely trying to resolve this quietly.</em></p>, <p>At this point, it seemed impossible for rumors not to spread.</p>, <p>But it wasn’t entirely a bad thing either.</p>, <p>Whether it was notoriety or any other form of fame, it served to elevate a fixer’s reputation. This, in turn, led to higher levels of compensation and more important quests.</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk was causing an uproar beyond imagination.</p>, <p>With this level of commotion, even the slowest informants would undoubtedly know of me.</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>On the surface of the black hooded sweatshirt I was wearing, two trails of light shone like neon signs. One was purple and the other was blue.</p>, <p>They were a kind of magic circuit that could evolve into magic circles.</p>, <p>I created them hastily without considering the symmetry or aesthetic aspects that mages obsessively maintain, and they ended up looking like scrawled graffiti.</p>, <p>Still, they had a certain graffiti-like coolness to them. Ah, but this wasn’t the time to be concerned with such things.</p>, <p>The purple circuit wrapped around my body endowed me with surreal leaping ability.</p>, <p><em>Whoosh</em></p>, <p>I jumped through the window and reached the roof of the building on the other side. The movement was more akin to flight than a leap.</p>, <p>The blue circuit glowed, compensating for my lack of agility and aiding in posture control.</p>, <p>Thanks to this additional circuit, I could perform feats beyond just explosive leaping power.</p>, <p>I pursued Lee Chang-hyuk while jumping from one rooftop to another across the city.</p>, <p>Wherever I went, dazzling trails of light that looked like neon signs trailed behind me.</p>, <p><em>Whoosh-</em></p>, <p>I leaped across a rooftop.</p>, <p><em>Thud, tap-tap- whoosh.</em></p>, <p>Then I took another leap forward using an unstable signboard as a stepping stone.</p>, <p>I moved freely between the dark city’s sky and the buildings’ rooftops.</p>, <p>This was almost on the level of a superhero. I might be able to fly if I level up more, but this feeling is quite satisfying as it is.</p>, <p><em>– Gwaoooooo!</em></p>, <p><em>Boom! Bang bang bang!</em></p>, <p>Such a commotion in the middle of the night.</p>, <p>Having transformed into a half-human, half-beast monster, Lee Chang-hyuk acted without any semblance of reason.</p>, <p>He simply ran in any direction he could and destroyed anything that hindered him.</p>, <p>He was likely fleeing in madness but his rampage made tracking him easy enough.</p>, <p>I could snipe him from a distance but I needed to get close enough to avoid any problems.</p>, <p>Now… this distance should do. I was just about 15 meters away from Lee Chang-hyuk.</p>, <p>Having reached the rooftop in front of the alley he was running through, I positioned myself and shouted.</p>, <p>“Hey, Lee Chang-hyuk!”</p>, <p>As he ran, Lee Chang-hyuk looked up at me. It seems he recognizes his own name, at least.</p>, <p>My eyes met his long and horizontal pupils that looked like those of a mountain goat. His appearance was more demonic than beastly.</p>, <p>White foam was dribbling from the corners of his mouth.</p>, <p>Before he could make another move, my spell was ready.</p>, <p>“Die, you bastard!”</p>, <p>[Lightning Strike]</p>, <p><em>Rumble-</em></p>, <p>An intense light flashed brilliantly.</p>, <p>A bolt of lightning that was forcibly drawn from the sky cascaded down with a chilling flash. And then…</p>, <p><em>Boom!!</em></p>, <p>The thunder followed the light belatedly. It was a spell that summoned the very essence of natural lightning. It must have been excruciatingly painful.</p>, <p>“Arghhh!”</p>, <p>Excess electricity sparked and surged around Lee Chang-hyuk.</p>, <p>The ground around him was completely scorched black, but he hadn’t lost his spirit yet.</p>, <p>Realizing he could no longer flee, he began to thrash about desperately.</p>, <p>He grabbed a parked car nearby with his large hands and hurled it towards me.</p>, <p>“Ah, stop throwing things!”</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh… Boom!</em></p>, <p>I first countered the flying car with a fireball, stopping it in its tracks… Now it’s my turn, isn’t it? Time for a game of catch!</p>, <p>[Shockwave]</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>I pushed the exploding car back in mid-air, sending it flying back towards him!</p>, <p>The now-burning car hurtled towards him with even more menacing force.</p>, <p><em>– Gwaaaaah!</em></p>, <p>You think that will stop it, dumbass?</p>, <p>[Soundwave Refraction]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Range Increase]</p>, <p>A magic circle of soundwave refraction materialized right in front of his nose. The shock wave generated from the creature’s snout vanished futilely in the light of the magic circle.</p>, <p><em>Kwaang!</em></p>, <p>And then the car that was flying towards him crushed his body with its immense flame and weight.</p>, <p>At the same time…</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p>A fireball far larger than before formed in the air. I felt almost as if I were summoning and hurling the sun itself.</p>, <p><em>Gooo…</em></p>, <p>Having maximized its firepower, a foreboding noise emanated from the fireball itself. Anyway, this was going to be the end.</p>, <p><em>Kwaang!!!</em></p>, <p>An enormous explosion and heat swirled for a long time. The surrounding asphalt melted and boiled.</p>, <p>The car that had crushed him was completely flattened and bounced far away, while he lay there, completely charred.</p>, <p>Still, he was incredibly tough. His extremities, like fingers, were crushed, but he still writhed with his limbs reasonably intact.</p>, <p>“Guoo… Grrrrr…”</p>, <p>Things were roughly sorted out.</p>, <p><em>But should I even say this was a success…</em></p>, <p>The request was to retrieve Lee Chang-hyuk along with the security bag containing the test subject, right?</p>, <p>From the Helistic company perspective, Lee Chang-hyuk who mutated by fusing with the test subject may also have some use.</p>, <p>However, they would probably come up with all sorts of excuses to blame me for the failure of the mission, wouldn’t they?</p>, <p>After all this effort, I couldn’t accept it ending as an unpaid service.</p>, <p>I momentarily fiddled with the ring on my finger while looking down at Lee Chang-hyuk, who was in a near-death state.</p>, <p>A human mutated by the blessing of Shub-Niggurath…</p>, <p>Several ideas came to mind. But would that work? Such an idea would be impossible to execute in the game.</p>, <p>But… somehow, I felt that it might be possible.</p>, <p>Up until now, I had cleared various challenges based on my experience as a gamer.</p>, <p>However, the idea that had just occurred to me was something difficult to conceive with the mindset of viewing this world as a game.</p>, <p><em>Is this inspiration thanks to the intelligence of 30?</em></p>, <p>Originally, the concept of mutating using a quest item was also an idea that couldn’t be realized in the game.</p>, <p>“Hooo…”</p>, <p>Alright. There’s no harm in trying.</p>, <p>I jumped down from the roof and approached Lee Chang-hyuk’s body.</p>, <p>Intense heat rose from the now sticky asphalt ground. It was so intense that an ordinary person would have struggled to breathe in such temperature.</p>, <p>Yet, thanks to my fire resistance, I felt no discomfort from the heat.</p>, <p>Ah, but that wasn’t the case for my mask. I quickly channeled magical power to protect it.</p>, <p><em>Ugh… this is so inconvenient.</em></p>, <p>I’d have to make time later to change or upgrade the mask.</p>, <p>As I approached, Lee Chang-hyuk barely managed to gasp for air, unable to move.</p>, <p>Hmm… still, just to be safe…</p>, <p>“I never thought I’d use it in this situation, but it was a good idea to keep it anyway.”</p>, <p>I opened my backpack and took out the straps I had packed.</p>, <p>There were six of them that were torn from the straitjacket earlier in the day. These brown leather straps fluttered in the air.</p>, <p>Before the straps hit the ground, I extended my hand and infused them with a bright green magical power.</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>[Entangling Rope]</p>, <p>The straps, now imbued with magical power, slithered like snakes and they coiled around Lee Chang-hyuk’s body.</p>, <p>Since they were hardened by magical power, they were unlikely to catch fire or break easily.</p>, <p>I slowly reached out my hand towards him and then I pushed magical power into the Ring of Corrupted Flames.</p>, <p>He let out a death-like groan and thrashed a few times, but he couldn’t escape.</p>, <p>“Hey, stay still for a moment.”</p>, <p>It seemed like an impossible task at first, but I somehow felt like I could do it</p>, <p>The blessing of [The Black Goat of a Thousand Young]…</p>, <p>I began to expel the power of [The Living Flame].</p>, <p>In the world of [Cthulhu], there were various spells, but I had never seen magic used in such a way.</p>, <p>However, by combining the effects of individual spells… it seemed possible.</p>, <p>This was something I had learned while actually using magic. It was more than just clicking a button.</p>, <p>[Prayer of Protection]</p>, <p>[Elevation]</p>, <p>[Gesture of Guardianship]</p>, <p>Magic circles of various colors began to emerge around my body.</p>, <p>[Elevation] would awaken Lee Chang-hyuk’s weakened body and mind.</p>, <p>[Prayer of Protection] would cling to Lee Chang-hyuk’s soul, which was under the control of an outer goddess.</p>, <p>[Gesture of Guardianship] would protect Lee Chang-hyuk from the intense treatment about to begin….at least his human part.</p>, <p>[Power Expulsion]</p>, <p>[Regeneration]</p>, <p>New spells were activated. The magic circles orbited around me, each responding to the effects of the others.</p>, <p>[Regeneration] would provide the power to revert his transformed body back to human form.</p>, <p>[Power Expulsion] was a spell to drive out the influence of the outer goddess. However, it was a first-order spell with only the effect of driving out evil spirits. It wasn’t enough on its own.</p>, <p>[Word of Power]</p>, <p>[Word of Power] was a spell to temporarily control a human weaker than myself. It would only allow him to carry out simple commands I vocalized… but now I needed Lee Chang-hyuk’s strength too.</p>, <p>“Lee Chang-hyuk, return to your human form.”</p>, <p>In the process of using and fusing spells, an inspiration I had never experienced before emerged.</p>, <p>It felt like a fountain of light had burst inside my head. Such ecstasy arose…. the kind only realized when an expectation turns into reality.</p>, <p>As I had previously thought, I became capable of not only what I could do but also what I had believed impossible.</p>, <p>A new spell was completed.</p>, <p>[The Flame that Burns Sin].</p>, <p>Such a spell did not exist in [Cthulhu World]. Moreover, it wasn’t a spell that a first-order mage could activate.</p>, <p>Using the Ring of Corrupted Flame, which allowed the activation of some fire attribute spells regardless of hierarchy, I forcibly drew in the abundant heat around me.</p>, <p>It was akin to borrowing the power of [Living Flame], a being from the abyss… I was certain I could draw it out.</p>, <p>It seemed absurd, but it turned out to be easier than expected. With an intelligence of 30, it seems I can do almost anything.</p>, <p><em>Whoosh…</em></p>, <p>From the tips of Lee Chang-hyuk’s feet, white flames began to rise.</p>, <p>The flames burned only the non-human parts of his body.</p>, <p>The areas the fire passed over were reverting back to human form.</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Feast Offering’ has been activated. ‘Being of the Abyss: Living Flame’ is showing interest in you.]</p>, <p>What? Just because I used a bit of its power, it’s come to watch? I felt the hairs on my forearm stand on end.</p>, <p>I heightened my [Enhanced Vigilance] trait and scanned the surroundings, but there were no significant changes. Was it just observing?</p>, <p>Damn it, watch or don’t watch. This is the crucial part. If I intended to just burn it away… I wouldn’t have started this in the first place.</p>, <p>[Liquid Manipulation] [Restraint]</p>, <p>[Evil Gaze]</p>, <p>[Cold Bone Prison]</p>, <p>This time, there were four spells.</p>, <p>[Evil Gaze] minimized the influence of the outer goddess.</p>, <p>[Liquid Manipulation] and [Restraint] crystallized the silver goat’s fluid that had spread throughout Lee Chang-hyuk’s body.</p>, <p>Lastly, [Cold Bone Prison] created a barrier from the netherworld …</p>, <p>Sweat trickled down the back of my neck. I felt slightly dizzy.</p>, <p>This was a task of a completely different caliber than picking a mere lock. I was extracting a mythical being, fused at the cellular level, from a human body…</p>, <p><em>Crackle… Fizz…</em></p>, <p>From Lee Chang-hyuk’s head, the unpleasant sound of skin being torn away reached my ears. Lee Chang-hyuk-ssi… please sacrifice a bit of your scalp as the cost of your life.</p>, <p><em>Crunch.</em></p>, <p>The completely separated fluid of the black goat was trapped in a geometrically shaped barrier created in mid-air as it writhed grotesquely.</p>, <p>Well, indeed. It worked.</p>, <p>I wiped the sweat trickling down my neck and pulled the floating barrier toward me.</p>, <p>The task was a complete success. It wasn’t for nothing that I saved Lee Chang-hyuk.</p>, <p>It didn’t matter to me whether this guy lived or died. However, had I not separated the fluid from his body, the quest would have been deemed a failure.</p>, <p>If it had been utterly impossible, that would be one thing. But if it’s doable, it’s better to do it.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>(TN: Sorry. It seems Tudor is female. Yeah, I was overthinking stuff. Will correct everything about that. <em>Sigh</em>.)</p>, <p>*****</p>, <p>[You have saved a human corrupted by the fluid of the ‘Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young’! This is an astonishing feat that no one in this world has ever attempted. Beings from the abyss have witnessed your accomplishment. While some entities may have taken interest in you, others felt anger, but you remain undeterred, focusing solely on your principles.]</p>, <p>Principles or not, I was just trying to complete a quest. About 40% of it was just curiosity to see how far I could go. Anyway, these messages keep pushing this narrative that I’m acting for some righteous cause… I can’t figure out what they want.</p>, <p>[Remarkable Achievement Unlocked! You have banished the power of the ‘Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young’ and reverted a heteromorphic being back to human form. You have earned the ‘Mythical Achievement: He who insulted the Abyssal One’.</p>, <p>As a reward for this achievement, you will gain the hidden trait ‘Secret Knowledge: Life Creation’ and additional experience points.]</p>, <p>Suddenly, an outrageous reward came my way.</p>, <p>The phrase ‘He who insulted the Abyssal One’ bothered me a bit, but the reward for it was a hidden trait.</p>, <p>Hidden Trait [Secret Knowledge: Life Creation].</p>, <p>This is the first time I’ve seen such a trait. Wow, did something like this exist?</p>, <p>As [Secret Knowledge: Life Creation] activated, new knowledge I had never known before began to emerge in my mind.</p>, <p>Now, if only I had the materials…</p>, <p><em>Humans can also be made…?</em></p>, <p>What is this immense knowledge? I had no idea such things were hidden. My actions were merely aimed at completing a request, yet I received an unimaginable reward.</p>, <p><em>I’m not sure yet how to use this knowledge.</em></p>, <p>Creating people for what purpose? Moreover, the necessary materials are utterly absurd.</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>[You have defeated the fixer Lee Chang-hyuk.]</p>, <p>[You have defeated the ‘Mutant’. Your understanding of the gods improved.]</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 2.]</p>, <p>[Discovery: You have acquired a secret item (1). Experience points gained.]</p>, <p>This must be a reward for obtaining the fluid of Shub-Niggurath… Though I planned to return it, the separate experience points were a pleasant bonus.</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>Was I now level 14? Normally, it would have been difficult to even increase one level against such a trivial foe… But thanks to the strange things he did, my level went up a lot more than I expected.</p>, <p>The experience points from the quest rewards hadn’t come in yet, so perhaps by the end of tonight, I might reach level 15.</p>, <p>All I had to do was go back to Café Vasilisa and hand over Lee Chang-hyuk and the body fluids to Tudor and it would all be over.</p>, <p><em>Ah, there’s a place I need to visit first.</em></p>, <p>The place I stopped by before returning to Tudor wasn’t anything extraordinary.</p>, <p>It was the chaotic mess of Lee Chang-hyuk’s motel room.</p>, <p>Although the situation had been resolved, it was resolved so quickly that the motel owner still hadn’t returned.</p>, <p>The motel’s guests had evacuated to the lounge, forming a crowd, but…</p>, <p>Since I had blasted through the wall with my magical power at the end, I was able to sneak in without going through the lounge.</p>, <p><em>I don’t have much time to search.</em></p>, <p>In this lawless neighborhood, reporting to the police was futile as they wouldn’t respond quickly.</p>, <p>Perhaps it would be even faster to pay brokers extra to hire a fixer?</p>, <p>Nevertheless, it was quieting down and the curious onlookers were beginning to gather outside.</p>, <p>All I needed to do was find one thing and leave. I laid Lee Chang-hyuk, who was wrapped in a straitjacket, down and searched the room.</p>, <p>He wasn’t dead, but he was completely unconscious and likely wouldn’t wake up for several days.</p>, <p>Ah, there it is.</p>, <p>I found the security bag that Lee Chang-hyuk had thrown earlier.</p>, <p>Inside it…I placed the [Black Goat’s Body Fluid] extracted from Lee Chang-hyuk, turning it into the [Artifact: Security Bag with the Test Subject] which was originally the object of the request.</p>, <p>Of course, such details wouldn’t appear in any explanation, but accuracy is crucial in artifact retrieval requests.</p>, <p>Even the slightest damage or deviation from the request’s conditions is unacceptable. This isn’t a place lenient enough to just shrug off inevitable issues with a casual “Oh, is that so?”</p>, <p>This is especially true for requests involving nefarious corporations like Helistic.</p>, <p>However, a somewhat tricky problem arose.</p>, <p><em>The amount of this has increased, hasn’t it?</em></p>, <p>A magical engineering security device was installed inside the bag.</p>, <p>When I tried to place the [Black Goat’s Body Fluid] into it, I realized that the amount exceeded the specified quantity.</p>, <p><em>Did it absorb something from Lee Chang-hyuk and grow…?</em></p>, <p>It wasn’t a major issue. I just needed to split and store only the amount required inside the bag.</p>, <p><em>Fizz-crackle-pop.</em></p>, <p>It hasn’t increased by much. After confining the fluid in the security bag, the remaining quantity was only about the size of a little finger.</p>, <p><em>This might also be useful.</em></p>, <p>It was indeed a dangerous substance. If it parasitized my body, I could transform into a monster like Lee Chang-hyuk.</p>, <p>Still, it was more dangerous to throw it away and above all…</p>, <p>It was an incredibly valuable catalyst. Selling it to a company hostile to Helistic could fetch me several hundred million.</p>, <p>In the end, I rummaged through the refrigerator and found a bottle of water which I emptied.</p>, <p>It was just an ordinary plastic bottle, but the material didn’t matter. What was more important was its ability to contain something… and the will and magical power contained within.</p>, <p>After infusing the bottle with magical power and forming a glowing magical circle, I trapped the black goat’s body fluid inside it.</p>, <p>Now, unless I permit it, nothing can escape from this bottle. Of course, this was a temporary measure and I would need to invest more time later for a safer solution.</p>, <p>And then… in the messy motel room, I found some jewelry and three bundles of cash, each worth about five million won. Roughly fifteen million won in total? Perhaps a part of his escape funds?</p>, <p>He wouldn’t have been dreaming of fleeing overseas with just this amount. Seeing as I couldn’t see anything else in this room right now, I guess he was hiding a bigger sum of money somewhere else.… But I didn’t have the luxury to search for that now.</p>, <p>It could be buried under a garlic field in some remote mountain or stashed in a dummy account, or perhaps an agent was holding onto it.</p>, <p>I also scooped up all the miscellaneous items Lee Chang-hyuk had, including trivial documents and identification cards, into my bag.</p>, <p>There might be clues in these items to locate Lee Chang-hyuk’s funds. Of course, he might have already passed them to a smuggling broker, or they could be in a place impossible to trace… But taking these few papers wouldn’t cause any harm.</p>, <p>During this process, I stumbled upon a rather large suitcase.</p>, <p>I had been pondering how to transport the almost luggage-like Lee Chang-hyuk, and there it was: the perfect solution.</p>, <p>It was a bag for the essentials of a fugitive life, but once emptied, it was big enough to fit a robust adult. Very good.</p>, <p>I walked outside and hailed a taxi.</p>, <p>My destination was once again the Geumchon neighborhood. Today, I had really traveled far and wide.</p>, <p>The taxi driver I met this time wore an excited expression. He tried to start a conversation with me several times hoping that I had a good story to tell, but as I didn’t respond, he eventually fell silent.</p>, <p>Was this a common trait among taxi drivers in Paju?</p>, <p>After a long drive, the taxi stopped by the roadside where the large brass Buddha statue of Haknyeongsan Forest Park was visible.</p>, <p>As the night fully descended, the neon signs of the Geumcho neighborhood lit up casting dazzling lights everywhere. Bathed in these fluorescent hues, the brass Buddha exuded an eerily mystical atmosphere.</p>, <p>Now, meeting Tudor to receive the payment would conclude my day’s work.</p>, <p><em>Huh?</em></p>, <p>Vasilisa was a café that operated 24/7, every day of the year.</p>, <p>It was run by an employee whose humanity was questionable and a witch whose age was unknown. The shop also served as a brokerage for various information and services circulated in the underworld.</p>, <p>Its influence extended not just to Paju but across the entire metropolitan area… Meaning, that regardless of the time, it was never a place short of customers.</p>, <p>But now Vasilisa was completely devoid of customers.</p>, <p>Of course, it was late. When I opened the smartphone found among Lee Chang-hyuk’s belongings, it showed 3 AM.</p>, <p>It wasn’t unusual for the place to be empty at this hour. However, the atmosphere felt strangely off.</p>, <p>The giant beauty, or rather the witch Tudor, was waiting for me right at the entrance of the shop. She opened the door and said.</p>, <p>“We’ve closed for regular business today.”</p>, <p>“I don’t think you’re telling me to go back because you’re done for the day, right?”</p>, <p>“That’s right. I wanted to have a comfortable chat with you, so I chased out all those nosy gossip-lovers. Come in, dear.”</p>, <p>Tudor led the way and chattered in a cheerful voice. She seemed to be in an exceptionally good mood.</p>, <p>“Lee Chang-hyuk is… in that bag, I assume? You didn’t disassemble him, did you? Orb! Come here and take the bag!”</p>, <p>“He’s still alive inside the bag.”</p>, <p>Orb with his large monitor instead of a human head approached me and took the suitcase.</p>, <p>As I handed over the suitcase containing Lee Chang-hyuk and the security bag, a quest completion message appeared.</p>, <p>[Despite the absurd and unexpected situation, you used your amazing wisdom and profound magic to solve the problem and arrest the evil criminal Lee Chang-hyuk. Many have started to take notice of your actions. Tudor, the broker you’re contracted with, has developed a deep fondness for you. Expect more requests and rewards from her in the future.]</p>, <p>[You have completed the quest!</p>, <p>&lt;Bounty Quest: Hunting Lee Chang-hyuk&gt;</p>, <p>Reward: 50,000XP (+the monetary reward promised by the broker is separate)]</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>[You have reached level 15! As a level achievement reward, you receive (1) bonus stat point to distribute freely.]</p>, <p>I allocated the bonus stat point to charm as planned.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa</p>, <p>Class: Mage Gazing into the Abyss</p>, <p>Level: 15</p>, <p>Magic Order: First Order</p>, <p>Mental Illness: [Mask Obsession], [Triskaidekaphobia]</p>, <p>Strength: 5(+3) (Ring of Corrupted Flame)</p>, <p>Health: 6</p>, <p>Agility: 8</p>, <p>Intelligence: 30</p>, <p>Mental Strength: 14</p>, <p>Charm: 17</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>“Dear, are you okay?”</p>, <p>Tudor slightly bent forward as she looked at me with her big eyes. I couldn’t really feel it while sitting, but Tudor was very tall, roughly…about 1.9 meters? Yet, despite her height, every aspect of her physique was ideally proportioned, leaving no room for awkwardness. She seemed more like a perfect embodiment of a goddess from a fantasy. As expected, her charm score of 20 is not just for show.</p>, <p>However, apart from her high charm score, there was a strong presence and an intimidating air about her. It’s possible that she has the blood of a non-human race mixed in, but the game provides no details on that, so the specifics remain unknown.</p>, <p>I waved my hand dismissively at Tudor’s gaze.</p>, <p>“I’m fine. Just lost in thought for a moment.”</p>, <p>Even though she’s a witch with remarkable abilities, Tudor, like any other character in the game, cannot see message windows or status screens. Does that mean she’s merely a character within the game?</p>, <p>Tudor wore a worried look for a moment as if concerned about my mental state, then broke into a bright smile. Her expression does change effortlessly.</p>, <p>“I was expecting some sensational news~, but wow, you handled it in quite the noisy way, didn’t you?”</p>, <p>“Were you watching?”</p>, <p>“That’s not true. But given the absurdity of what happened, it’s not surprising that I know. The incident was already making the rounds on the brokers’ network.”</p>, <p>*****</p>, <p>(TN: The reason why I assumed Tudor was a male was, well, cuz of the name Tudor. The reason why I’m assuming she’s a female now, because of the term beauty/beautiful woman(미녀). And the term goddess (여신). Which is gender-specific</p>, <p>If you’re confused about why I’m still not sure about the gender here, it’s because compared to English, Korean has a general absence of gender-specific pronouns.)</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Brokers’ networks, indeed… I remembered there were such things.</p>, <p>Not only in Paju, but hackers operating nationwide hacked various networks to disseminate information.</p>, <p>There were many hackers who worked as freelancers, and there were even guilds akin to hackers’ associations. Was it called the Neuro Kids?</p>, <p>When I didn’t say anything, Tudor continued the conversation and she seemed to be in a good mood.</p>, <p>“Not just the brokers’ network, but almost every community, be it in the light or shadow, is abuzz with stories about you. Origin unknown, identity unknown, abilities unknown – who is he? With a little more push, he could become the most famous newcomer among fixers this year, couldn’t he?”</p>, <p>Though I admit I had dealt with the quest in a rather noisy way, it seemed to have caused more of a stir than I had anticipated.</p>, <p>Fortunately, Tudor seemed to have taken a complete liking to me and with such fame, it would likely be a great help in finding clues to escape from this [Cthulhu World] in the future.</p>, <p>“Being famous should be advantageous for getting noticed, right? Since I find such tasks cumbersome, could you help me out?”</p>, <p>“Ah, sure. I was already ignoring the nudges from other brokers. If your taste is for something flashy, I’ll pull as many strings as I can~.”</p>, <p>Tudor said this while rubbing her hands together in a theatrical manner. Given her fondness for such noisy affairs, she would probably handle it well on her own.</p>, <p>When we entered the office where I had previously received the quest, Tudor sat me down and started fiddling with the safe behind the desk.</p>, <p>“Didn’t expect you to return so quickly. You really impressed me.”</p>, <p>“The quicker I work, the sooner I get paid.”</p>, <p>Tudor nodded her head and took out some cash.</p>, <p>“Here, this is 27 million won, minus a 10% commission. If you prefer, I can pay you in a different form instead of cash.”</p>, <p>Although there was a commission, there was the option to exchange for other goods or services, or even to launder the money into an anonymous account.</p>, <p>Most brokers could offer these services, but Tudor provided the most extensive and diverse range of them.</p>, <p>“Prepare an ID for me and an account in the name on that ID. And for the money… just give me 5 million for now. It would be great if you could deposit the rest into that account.”</p>, <p>“Hmm, what level of identity?”</p>, <p>“Just make it Kim Shin-hwa, and make the ID as clean as possible within the budget.”</p>, <p>“Alright. I’ll create an identity so clean you could even sit for a civil service exam.”</p>, <p>I wanted to ask for a safe house as well but it was too much for my current budget. For the time being, I would have to hop from motel to motel.</p>, <p>I picked up one bundle of the stacked money worth 5 million won and stood up.</p>, <p>“I’ll come back again.”</p>, <p>“I’ll have the ID and bank book ready by next month. Don’t take too long to come back. I might start missing you.”</p>, <p>I left the café, leaving Tudor’s playful words behind.</p>, <p>The chilly night air brushed against my skin as I unconsciously looked up at the sky… it was an incredibly unfamiliar sky.</p>, <p>The constellations were placed in completely different positions than I remembered and they shone with a strange and mystical light.</p>, <p>An indescribable discomfort rose in my chest.</p>, <p><em>This is not the world I lived in.</em></p>, <p>No matter how many incidents I resolved in this world, the only thing waiting for me was destruction.</p>, <p>I needed to earn money, increase my abilities and level… Slowly build a reputation, and then uncover the truth of this world.</p>, <p>And escape from this terrible, dangerous place.</p>, <p>I couldn’t stay here any longer. I had to escape, no matter what.</p>, <p>If I delayed, an [ending] would inevitably come, in one form or another.</p>, <p>There were hundreds of possible endings I could reach, but none of them led to a happy conclusion… only to terrible destruction, profound despair, unbelievable downfall, and evil, blasphemous curses.</p>, <p>This world had an end.</p>, <p>That day, when the cycle of the world would come to a halt.</p>, <p>The day the abyss opened its maw.</p>, <p>As I pondered the events that would unfold at the [ending], my vision gradually blurred.</p>, <p>[□□□□ □□□□ □□□□□]</p>, <p>Everything became hazy.

I need to get rid of this mask obsession…”</p>, <p>After taking a deep breath and calming my mind for a moment, I slowly took off the mask and washed my face.</p>, <p>Of course, I held the mask in one hand the entire time. Dropping it could trigger a bout of distortion, so caution was necessary.</p>, <p>From several tests, I found that distortion didn’t occur immediately if the mask was only briefly set aside.</p>, <p>Moreover, covering my face with my hand or a towel allowed me a bit more leeway.</p>, <p>This meant I could manage basic tasks like washing my face or eating.</p>, <p>After setting aside the mask, I covered my face with a towel and stretched for a while.</p>, <p><em>Crack, crackle…</em></p>, <p>Raising my health and strength stats was indeed worthwhile. I wasn’t completely better, but I felt significantly more energetic.</p>, <p>I tossed aside the warped mask that was damaged from yesterday’s magical heat and took out a new one.</p>, <p>Thankfully, I had bought several when I made the purchase.</p>, <p>Yesterday’s mask was a plain white one, but today’s one was a comically designed skull mask; it was made of the same cheap plastic as the previous one.</p>, <p>The mask’s packaging read, [Creepy Skull Mask].</p>, <p>“Ugh… seriously…”</p>, <p>I can’t keep wearing such things forever, and I should probably find something more appropriate soon.</p>, <p>Whether it’s creepy or not, putting on the mask brings me peace of mind.</p>, <p>It dispels uncomfortable emotions, irritations, anxieties, suffocation, and dizziness, and makes me feel at ease.</p>, <p>For a brief moment, it even gave me a sensation akin to the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.</p>, <p><em>Ugh… at this rate, I might really go crazy.</em></p>, <p>Outside, the sun had already reached its zenith. I had no plans to go out today.</p>, <p>I needed to rest and organize my surroundings, especially after overexerting myself yesterday.</p>, <p>First, I began to take out the items I had haphazardly stuffed into my backpack.</p>, <p>[Essence of Fire (A-rank Catalyst): A crystallized form of pure red element.</p>, <p>It can be used to imbue items with the power of fire or for casting powerful flame magic.]</p>, <p>[Red Dragon’s Orb (A-rank Talisman): A bead formed from the breath of a fire dragon.</p>, <p>Fire Protection: Automatically casts the ‘Flame Barrier’ spell.</p>, <p>Remaining uses: 5.]</p>, <p>I wasn’t sure where the Essence of Fire would come in handy but I knew well about the Red Dragon’s Orb.</p>, <p>I just checked the magic contained in the orb, and it was more efficient for me to use my protective circle spell rather than the spell of the orb.</p>, <p>Besides, what A-rank artifact has a limit on the number of times it can be used?</p>, <p>Of course, for those who can’t use magic, such an item would be invaluable.</p>, <p><em>It would be better for me to sell this.</em></p>, <p>Items that help in survival are expensive.

There were documents belonging to Lee Chang-hyuk, but I just roughly organized and piled them up with the intention of looking at them again later.</p>, <p><em>Tudor will take care of the ID card and the bank account.</em></p>, <p>She said that it would take about a month.

My fingertips were numb, and my legs felt weak. Every movement of my shoulders was accompanied by ominous sounds.</p>, <p>I still needed to find an artifact to improve my health. Unlike the [Ring of Corrupted Flame] that boosts strength, there was an artifact that could increase health and could be bought with money.</p>, <p>I needed to go shopping to acquire it.</p>, <p><em>And I have to deal with some useless items and buy some bullets.</em></p>, <p>But today, I decided to rest a bit more… As I lay down, my eyes began to close…</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Today’s destination was a secret shop where you could trade items from the Cthulhu mythos.</p>, <p>I had dallied all day, and by the time I set out, it was already dark.</p>, <p>Wandering around at this time with a mask on was better.</p>, <p>Ignoring the surprised stares of the occasional passersby, I walked on. The secret shop was not far from my lodging.</p>, <p>Paju in reality has this tendency, but Paju in [Cthulhu World] is a city of abnormal and extreme haphazard development.</p>, <p>That’s why the atmosphere of the city changes completely with just a block or two’s difference.</p>, <p>[Welcome. Geumchon Traditional Market, Gate 3]</p>, <p>The area around Geumchon Traditional Market was a typical old downtown. It was a neighborhood where an old market that was formed long ago remained still and the surrounding scenery was either charmingly familiar or ambiguously run-down.</p>, <p>The buildings in the vicinity looked to be generally old as if they were built more than 40 years ago.</p>, <p><em>My body is still….</em></p>, <p>I had spent the entire day doing nothing but lying down, yet I could already feel my body getting stiff.</p>, <p>I sighed for a moment and looked up at the building where the [Secret Shop] was located.</p>, <p>It was a three-story building finished with colorful bricks.</p>, <p>The building’s walls were covered with signs that had faded from years of weathering…</p>, <p>Starting from the bottom right, the signs read as follows: a shoe store, a dubious-looking coffee shop, an eyewear shop announcing a clearance event, a mobile phone store with numerous Chinese instructions, a recently updated thrift fashion shop, a computer laundry, a boiler distributor, a fortune-telling shop, and a sign with letters fallen off, reading “eumhon awn hop”.</p>, <p>That “eumhon awn hop” was the secret shop. Well, it was called the Geumchon Pawnshop.</p>, <p>Of course, the pawnshop operation was a kind of front.</p>, <p>Alongside items typical for a pawnshop, it was a place where one could trade items from the Cthulhu mythos.</p>, <p>I walked up the narrow, dirty stairs and entered the pawnshop.</p>, <p>The Geumchon Pawnshop occupied a large space, almost an entire floor, but the space was cluttered and chaotic because of the miscellaneous and antiques piled up throughout the hall, which made it difficult to take a step forward.</p>, <p>Various odd items were displayed on shelves made of rustic wood. There were piles of Buddha statues, luxury watches, and stacks of old books.</p>, <p>Beside that shelf, cages containing creatures like lizards and parrots were placed, and on the floor next to the shelves lay old jars, radios, air conditioners, and various electronic devices.</p>, <p>Toys, comic books, bottles containing strange creatures, jewelry, incomprehensible magical tools, chakrams, masks, everyday necessities, crumpled clothes, dry herbs, and what appeared to be bone fragments and human remains were strewn about.</p>, <p>Just looking around this cluttered place was enough to make one’s head spin.</p>, <p>Among this chaos, a small girl who looked to be of middle to high school age was seen dozing off while leaning against a large metal gong.</p>, <p>She was dressed in a bulky school gym uniform with an old apron inscribed with “Geumchon Traditional Market Prosperity Association”. Her hair was tightly pulled back and her round face looked cute.</p>, <p>I recognized her. It was Jeong Ye-eun, the part-time worker at the Geumchon Pawnshop.</p>, <p>“Whew… Ah, welcome, heh?! Kyaaak!”</p>, <p>Startled by the sound of my footsteps, Ye-eun tried to rise and greet me, but upon seeing my face, or rather my mask, she screamed in surprise.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, her flailing arms caused a precariously stacked tower of rice cookers to collapse.</p>, <p><em>Warrrrr-</em></p>, <p>The cylindrical rice cookers rolled noisily across the already cramped pawnshop, knocking over several jars.</p>, <p><em>Crash!</em></p>, <p>The impact unsettled the shelves loaded with various animals, and several cages tumbled to the ground.</p>, <p><em>Bang, crash.</em></p>, <p>Ah, why on earth did this pawnshop keep such things? Among the broken boxes, one, unfortunately, contained white mice. They were probably used as food for reptiles?</p>, <p>Dozens of mice scattered in every direction.</p>, <p><em>Squeak, squeak.</em></p>, <p>I was relieved that I no longer had a fear of rats.</p>, <p>“Kyaaak! Catch them! Catch them!”</p>, <p>That was Ye-eun’s scream. She was asking me to catch the mice?</p>, <p>“What’s happening!”</p>, <p>A short old man burst out from the back room of the pawnshop. It seemed like it would have been better not to run.</p>, <p>“Uaaak!”</p>, <p>The old man tripped over a rice cooker rolling on the floor.</p>, <p><em>Crash!</em></p>, <p>He fell so dramatically that I was worried he might have broken something. Ah, and due to the impact of his fall, a nearby shelf began to tilt…</p>, <p><em>Crash, bang, boom!</em></p>, <p>What… what the hell is going on…?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The pawnshop was already dirty and cluttered and now it looked as if it had been bombed.</p>, <p>The old man who had fallen earlier was now wrapping a bandage around his arm and casting a glance at Jeong Ye-eun.</p>, <p>“I called you to help clean up, and on your first day, you turn the shop into this mess?”</p>, <p>“No, but I was really surprised!”</p>, <p>At the same time, Ye-eun subtly pointed at my mask.</p>, <p>“Look at that; isn’t it scary?”</p>, <p>It was partly my fault for coming wearing a skull-shaped mask. But can it really be said that this commotion was caused by me? If you want to blame me, you should at least make some effort to tidy up.</p>, <p>“Ah, my apologies. My granddaughter is rather absent-minded.”</p>, <p>Fortunately, the old man seemed to have decided to treat me not as a rogue or an intruder but as a customer.</p>, <p>“No, it’s fine.”</p>, <p>“Anyway, you seem like a customer who purposefully chose this time to visit. What can I help you with?”</p>, <p>The old man’s name is Jeong Eun-taek. Those who know him usually refer to him as Elder.</p>, <p>Now, he might seem like a shrunken and short elderly man, but he once had the reputation of being a renowned fixer.</p>, <p>He had resolved numerous Cthulhu Mythos events, some of which were horrific enough to threaten human extinction.</p>, <p>But now, he has retired and runs a secret shop.</p>, <p>I took out the [Red Dragon’s Orb] and showed it to him.</p>, <p>“I’d like to dispose of this. And there are things I want to buy as well.”</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek wore strange glasses with several small lenses and slowly examined the orb.</p>, <p>“Hmm… The craftsmanship is average, and it’s imbued with murky magical power. Not old… No, it was made recently. It’s not something that could have been made by normal means.”</p>, <p>He looked up at me. It’s tricky to reveal its origin.</p>, <p>I avoided answering by gesturing that I didn’t know, but he nodded his head as if he understood something.</p>, <p>“Well, I can dispose of this for you. Are you selling it?”</p>, <p>“How much will it fetch?”</p>, <p>“Religious artifacts often have questionable origins… let’s say 3,000.”</p>, <p>“You’re buying an artifact with a survival feature for that price?”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek grinned slyly.</p>, <p>“It seems you know what it is. Alright, 4,000.”</p>, <p>“…How about you throw in those gloves and make it 3,000?”</p>, <p>He frowned and turned his head in the direction I pointed.</p>, <p>[Slurping Gloves (B-rank Armor): Bike gloves with a modern design. It is an item that has been given magical power through the hands of a craftsman. Enhancement: Health +2]</p>, <p>“That item alone is worth two thousand.”</p>, <p>“How about fifteen hundred? I’ll buy those and the items listed here. Just give me a change of 20. I’m willing to take a slight loss.”</p>, <p>I handed him a note I had prepared earlier.</p>, <p>I knew from the beginning that this store would be such a messy place, so I wrote down the necessary catalysts and small tools in advance.</p>, <p>“Hmph…”</p>, <p>After reading the note, Chung looked at me for a moment with a look that said, “What the hell is this guy doing?” and then tossed the gloves to me.</p>, <p>The amount was surprisingly exact, wasn’t it?</p>, <p>“I’ll get the other items ready for you; just have a look around for a bit.”</p>, <p>“That’s fine.”</p>, <p>“Just don’t knock anything else over.”</p>, <p>“That’s something you should be saying to your granddaughter, not me.”</p>, <p>“Hmph!”</p>, <p>He picked up the orb and disappeared into the back room of the pawnshop.</p>, <p>I spent a moment examining the Slurping Gloves.</p>, <p>They were motorcycle gloves made of black leather.</p>, <p>Each glove featured a rugged carbon knuckle on the back of the hand and robust protectors on each finger.</p>, <p>I liked the design because it was quite cool.</p>, <p>Kind of… it stirred the middle-schooler inside my heart.</p>, <p>I tried them on and the size was perfect They clung to my hands in a pleasing way.</p>, <p>But why are they called Slurping Gloves?</p>, <p>There are so many better names, aren’t there? They’re not even gloves for eating ramen, so why such a name?

But then why do you dress like a crazy person?”</p>, <p>Her question was brutally honest. I responded with equal honesty.</p>, <p>“Well… maybe because I am a bit crazy?”</p>, <p>Was my answer too honest? Ye-eun stepped back slightly with a confused expression on her face. Oh no… is she going to cause another accident by moving around like that?</p>, <p>“Hey, wait!”</p>, <p>It was already too late. With Ye-eun stepping back, she knocked over a hanging cauldron. The large cauldron tumbled down and scattered various items everywhere.</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>I had to use a spell to catch it.

Are you a person with special abilities, ahjussi?”</p>, <p>“No, I’m a mage.”</p>, <p>“A mage? Oh! Is that why you’re wearing a mask?”</p>, <p>“Yes.”</p>, <p>I wasn’t sure what connection mages had with masks, but I was too lazy to say anything else so I just said yes.</p>, <p>“Wow!”</p>, <p><em>Clatter, bang!</em></p>, <p>Ye-eun’s was excited by my response and her enthusiastic jump caused more items to tumble down.</p>, <p>Just wow, please stay still.</p>, <p>This shop was far too dangerous for a girl her age brimming with energy.</p>, <p>Why on earth did he let her work here? Did he say this was her first day?</p>, <p>“Hey ahjussi, do you want to see some masks? There are really a lot over there!”</p>, <p>Evidently thrilled from having seen magic a few times unintentionally, she pulled me towards a corner of the pawnshop.</p>, <p>Did they sell masks here? I hadn’t specifically looked for masks in this place, so it was possible I didn’t know about them.</p>, <p>The area Ye-eun led me to was filled with a collection of masks.</p>, <p>There were traditional items like Hahoe masks, presumably Japanese and Chinese masks, along with colorful Venetian masks and even some scary ones that might have belonged to an African tribe.</p>, <p><em>I guess it’s possible that I didn’t remember them.</em></p>, <p>They were just ordinary masks after all.</p>, <p>I wasn’t sure if there was any antique value to them, but for the most part, they were items of little significance to me.</p>, <p><em>Still, maybe these masks are more convincing than those cheap plastic ones?</em></p>, <p>Before I was dragged into this world, I certainly never had an interest in masks of any sort.</p>, <p>However, now many things had changed. Was it because of my mask obsession?</p>, <p>The items I saw were just ordinary masks with no special functions or abilities, yet for some reason, they all seemed fascinating to me.</p>, <p>Eventually, I found myself slowly taking time to browse through the masks.</p>, <p>“How about it? There are some good ones, right?”</p>, <p>From Ye-eun’s expression, it seemed I had moved in a way that made me look like a serious mask otaku without even realizing it.</p>, <p>I tried to respond to Ye-eun, but I couldn’t open my mouth.</p>, <p>[System: ‘Madman’s Luck’ effect is activated.]</p>, <p>This was because a strange noise came from among the masks.</p>, <p><em>– El, El, El…… Ugh, Ugh, Y’kaaa…… L’geb.

Yes. There, that one.</p>, <p>Among the cluttered masks scattered around, the most unique and special one caught my eye.</p>, <p>It was a mask.</p>, <p>It was modeled after the shape of a hideous goblin. It was a mask of an odd form, with two additional holes beneath the eyeholes.</p>, <p>Meaning it didn’t have two eyeholes but four, which made it an utterly fascinating design.</p>, <p>What was stuck to my face right now?</p>, <p>Ah, it was a crude plastic mask imitating a skull.</p>, <p>To think I was wearing such a toy.</p>, <p>This couldn’t be called a mask.</p>, <p>The real mask was over there.</p>, <p>I wanted to wear that one.

I took it and replied,</p>, <p>“Thank you.”</p>, <p>He must think he made a good deal by buying the orb at a fair price.

As the oppressive spell that had confined it was lifted, the slime trapped in the glass bottle began to agitate violently.</p>, <p>I gestured slowly, guiding the slime.</p>, <p>“Now, come here, this way.”</p>, <p>The slime, drawn by my hand movements, slowly rose and entangled with the magic circles I had prepared.</p>, <p>“Yes, good. That’s where you need to go. You want to rest, don’t you?

He’s still following us!”</p>, <p>“How is this even possible!”</p>, <p>Amidst the thunderous roar of the bikes and the howling wind, my keen senses accurately picked up the biker gang’s blabber.</p>, <p>These were the bikers who had previously evaded their pursuers with their mobility.</p>, <p>But since I was keeping up with them with nothing but my bare body, it certainly warranted calling me a monster.</p>, <p>No, it wasn’t exactly with nothing.</p>, <p>One of the bikers finally couldn’t stand it anymore and let out a scream-like shout.</p>, <p>“How is he following us with that thing!”</p>, <p>A large skateboard was making an incredible noise as it sped along beneath me.</p>, <p>The actions I was performing were nearly impossible with just my strength and agility, but the spells forcibly cast on the board and my hoodie enabled me to do what I wanted.</p>, <p>[Speed Increase]</p>, <p>[Posture Control]</p>, <p>I pushed more magical power into the board to increase its speed.</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>A roar like that of a monster bike erupted from the skateboard, which didn’t even have an engine.</p>, <p>“Crazy!

This wasn’t something my fire resistance could fully handle.</p>, <p>“What’s there to bring, you mad dog? Go drink some cold water and cool your head.”</p>, <p>[Creation: Create Clear Water]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximize]</p>, <p><em>Kwaah!</em></p>, <p>Following my will, the magic circles created in the air started spewing out massive amounts of water.</p>, <p>“Tch!”</p>, <p>Upon seeing the massive amount of water I had created, Mad Dog flinched briefly before regaining his composure and charging at me.</p>, <p>Normally, it’s better to charge at a mage than to run away from them. Good decision.</p>, <p>As Mad Dog closed in, I imbued the cascading water with new properties.</p>, <p>[Whirling Waves]</p>, <p><em>Chaaaaaak!!! Kwapa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa!!!</em></p>, <p>The other bikers who were attempting to follow their leader and attack me were stunned by the incredible scene and tumbled to the ground in shock.</p>, <p>“A wave like this, on a dry road…!?”</p>, <p>The sight of waterfalls, waves, and raging torrents forming on a previously dry road was indeed a spectacle.</p>, <p>Despite the tremendous waves crashing over the road, not a single droplet touched me or the now disheartened remnants of the biker gang.</p>, <p>It was a massive torrent of violence directed solely at one man.</p>, <p><em>Rumble-rumble-rumble…</em></p>, <p>“Ugh… Ahh… Ahhhhh!!! Aaack!!”</p>, <p>[You have defeated ‘Biker Gang: Mad Dog’]</p>, <p>[You have defeated ‘Biker Team: Hellhound’]</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>Hmph… Just one level?</p>, <p>Now I was at level 16.</p>, <p>Ever since my battle against Lee Chang-hyuk, I had only encountered weaklings, so I didn’t gain much experience points.</p>, <p><em>It’s all because Tudor intentionally chose easy tasks with high rewards for me…</em></p>, <p>I appreciated that she did all of that in consideration of me, but it was still disappointing that I had only leveled up once after a whole month. I was hoping for more challenging tasks to begin soon.</p>, <p>I manipulated the waves to drag Mad Dog to my feet.</p>, <p>“You should have just surrendered quietly when I was being considerate, shouldn’t you?”</p>, <p>“Grrrr…”</p>, <p>If he had just surrendered without a fuss, it wouldn’t have come to this.</p>, <p>Mad Dog, who had been tossed around like clothes in an aggressively spinning washing machine, was now completely worn out.</p>, <p>Now that I took care of him, it was time to return. I looked around at the biker gang members crawling nearby and said,</p>, <p>“Anyone else wants to try their luck?”</p>, <p>“No-not at all!”</p>, <p>“P-please, just spare our lives!”</p>, <p>“I-it was all this bastard’s doing! He made us do it!”</p>, <p>“That’s right! Please forgive us!”</p>, <p>“What a bunch of disloyal bastards…”</p>, <p>Well, the mission was only to capture the leader so there was no need to bother with the others.</p>, <p>“Alright, that’s done… But where exactly am I?”</p>, <p>I looked around. I had run much farther than I originally intended.</p>, <p>The chase had been more entertaining than I expected, and I just lost track of time.</p>, <p>Would I even be able to hail a taxi in this neighborhood at this hour?</p>, <p>“Would you like a ride to the city center?”</p>, <p>A strange voice came from an unexpected direction.</p>, <p>It had a very unique accent. Not Korean, but a foreigner’s voice.</p>, <p>The direction was… over there, in the shadows of the dark trees beyond the road. I could see a figure lurking.</p>, <p>Who is this bastard loitering around in the middle of the night, trying to act all mysterious?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>A shadow emerged from among the trees lining the road outside.</p>, <p>The figure was roughly my height, and he looked to be a foreigner dressed in a suit.</p>, <p>“You have impressive skills beyond imagination. It was truly a spectacle to behold.”</p>, <p>Judging by the accent, perhaps Chinese? A Chinese person capable of finding me in the middle of the night… Ah, I know who it is.</p>, <p>“No big deal.”</p>, <p>I brushed off the man’s comment from within the shadows as I finished up my task.</p>, <p>[Lightning]</p>, <p><em>Fzzzzt!</em></p>, <p>“Argh!”</p>, <p>Mad Dog who had been sprawled at my feet was already in a near-death state, but with a third party intervening, I couldn’t predict what complications might arise so I knocked him out.</p>, <p>Glancing towards the shadow, I spoke,</p>, <p>“If you’re not here to interfere… could you wait a bit? Let me handle this first, then we can talk.”</p>, <p>I stuffed the unconscious Mad Dog into a prepared carrier. Only then did I notice his arm was twisted in an unnatural direction.</p>, <p>It seemed severely broken… Should I administer first aid?</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>Although there’s no healing magic in the first-order spells available to me, I could use hardening to temporarily splint a broken arm, mimicking the effect of a makeshift cast.</p>, <p>Anyway, that was enough for now. There were bikers loitering around, having lost their bikes, but it seemed none of them had the loyalty to risk their lives by charging in.</p>, <p>Anyway, it looked like I had more or less wrapped things up here and now, should I deal with that loitering Chinese man over there…? What on earth was he doing here?</p>, <p>I walked in the direction I heard the voice and called his name.</p>, <p>“But Park Kwang-lim-ssi? What brings you here?”</p>, <p>“…I heard that a rising star had appeared, so I thought I might come and offer my business card.”</p>, <p>He probably wanted to make an impressive entrance but now that I showed that I knew his name, he showed a hint of embarrassment.</p>, <p>When the distance became close enough, Park Kwang-lim stepped out of the shadows between the trees and fully revealed himself.</p>, <p>He was a man with narrow eyes and he wore an old-fashioned suit and an out-of-date fedora.</p>, <p>“I already have my own contacts for dealings, you see…”</p>, <p>This man’s name was Park Kwang-lim. Though Chinese, he was a broker like Tudor and operated in Paju.</p>, <p>“I’d prefer not to expand my contacts, so if it’s that kind of business, I’d rather you go through Tudor at Café Vasilisa.”</p>, <p>“It’s just that Tudor has been overly protective of Kim Shin-hwa-ssi…”</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim momentarily smiled while fiddling with his fedora.</p>, <p>Was there some other motive behind his visit?</p>, <p>“How about it? Why don’t you listen to what I have to say for a moment? There are many people curious about who Kim Shin-hwa-ssi really is.”</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim worked as a broker, but his business specialized in information trading. Essentially, he was an information dealer whose main job was akin to that of a private investigator.</p>, <p>“I don’t think there’s much benefit for me in talking to you, though. I know you’ll just exaggerate whatever little I say and sell it to all sorts of people.”</p>, <p>While I did need fame, I had no interest in generating baseless rumors.</p>, <p>As if I hit the nail right on the hand, Park Kwang-lim made a grimace before continuing.</p>, <p>“If you’re looking for financial gains, there are better options than Tudor. Are you aware that Tudor’s commission rates are quite high compared to others in this field?”</p>, <p>That was true.</p>, <p>Tudor’s commission rates were indeed expensive in this business.</p>, <p>“If you wish, I can introduce you to cheaper and reliable contacts.”</p>, <p>“It’s not about needing money urgently. I’m content with Tudor.”</p>, <p>I needed money, but if it was just about the money, there were easier jobs available. I chose Tudor for the future quests that might connect and for the unique items only obtainable through Tudor.</p>, <p>Of course, the most important point was that Tudor was a highly trustworthy broker who would never betray me.</p>, <p>I especially knew the potential consequences I would be facing if I were to deal with Park Kwang-lim instead.</p>, <p><em>Never do anything with this guy!</em></p>, <p>“It’s not just about money, I can also connect you to other lines. As a mage, you might be seeking more useful knowledge or artifacts, right? I have contacts that could link you to such things.”</p>, <p>He was more persistent than I expected.</p>, <p>Though I was praised as a promising new talent, honestly, it wasn’t the time for headhunting to start already.</p>, <p>In just over a month, I had captured only a handful of wanted criminals. Was that really enough reason for him to cling to me like this?</p>, <p>“Stop it, and just tell me your real purpose for coming here.”</p>, <p>“Uh… Alright.”</p>, <p>Tsk, look. I knew it would be like this.</p>, <p>“I think you might start getting annoyed, so I’ll just ask one thing.”</p>, <p>I was already annoyed.</p>, <p>“What is it?”</p>, <p>“Did you happen to visit Unjeong Station about a month ago?”</p>, <p>Unjeong Station…</p>, <p>Aha, so this was the real issue all along?</p>, <p>About a month ago at Unjeong Station, I had robbed the cultists of the [Descendants of Fomalhaut] and completely messed up their temple…</p>, <p>“If it was a month ago… Well, I can’t recall anything specific.”</p>, <p>This information should not be shared with anyone, especially not with Park Kwang-lim.</p>, <p>It would spread faster than the 9 o’clock news to everyone if I were to tell him.</p>, <p>“I see. I was just asking because someone I do business with has been looking for something since a month ago, so I wondered if you might know.”</p>, <p>The Descendants of Fomalhaut, those people, it seemed they had bribed Park Kwang-lim to find me?</p>, <p>“Then all the more reason I know nothing.”</p>, <p>“So, you truly don’t know about a ring that’s been lost?”</p>, <p>From the cultists’ perspective, it must be an important sacred item, and they would be desperately searching for it. That ring was currently on my finger.</p>, <p>“Well, it seems there’s nothing I can help with.”</p>, <p>“Oh… In truth, such items are difficult to recover unless the thief decides to sell them to a fence, right? That’s why I’ve almost given up.”</p>, <p>Did his words imply that if I tried to sell the stolen ring, I would be caught immediately? It could be read as a threat, but it seemed more like he was on my side for now.</p>, <p>I nodded noncommittally and then said to Park Kwang-lim.</p>, <p>“Is that all you wanted?”</p>, <p>“That’s all.”</p>, <p>“Fine. Then, before you go, give me your business card and I’ll keep it handy.”</p>, <p>“Ah, of course. Whenever you part ways with Tudor, feel free to get in touch.”</p>, <p>“Well… More than that, it’s for when I urgently need to find someone to contact.”</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim’s narrowed eyes became even narrower at my words. It must have bothered him that I knew too much while he knew nothing about me.</p>, <p>He possessed a very special ability called [Dowsing].</p>, <p>With just a few clues, he could locate the whereabouts of any person.</p>, <p>However, his ability was limited to finding people and not objects.</p>, <p>If that weren’t the case, he would have discovered that I had the ring.</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim tried very hard to maintain his calm expression and handed me his business card.</p>, <p>“Ah, hmm, hmmm, here’s my card. Could I possibly get a way to contact you…?”</p>, <p>“I haven’t got a mobile phone yet.”</p>, <p>That was actually true.</p>, <p>It was about time Tudor made me an ID card, and once I had it, I planned to get a smartphone.</p>, <p>But Park Kwang-lim seemed to misunderstand and looked a little disappointed.</p>, <p>“Understood. Please feel free to contact me at any time. As you know, there’s no one in Paju who can match me in finding people.”</p>, <p>He had personally come all this way to show off his ability, so surely he was confident in his unparalleled skills, wasn’t he?</p>, <p>Anyway, befriending Park Kwang-lim could be beneficial later on if I needed help finding randomly hiding individuals like Lee Chang-hyuk.</p>, <p>“Ah, right. And one more thing.”</p>, <p>“Yes, what is it?”</p>, <p>“Could you give me a lift to Vasilisa?”</p>, <p>“……..”</p>, <p>Didn’t he say earlier that he would give me a ride?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>“So, this is what happened.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… Are you trying to show off your popularity now?”</p>, <p>I recounted the story of Park Kwang-lim to Tudor at Café Vasilisa. Tudor briefly wore a sulky expression on her face.</p>, <p>It was probably a display of displeasure, but given her charming looks, it seemed more like she was preparing for a prank than a complaint.</p>, <p>“I told you to stay put, and yet you’re out snooping around… Maybe I should send a gift to the opposition soon.”</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim’s business was located in the opposition district.</p>, <p>The company name on the card was… [Opposition Detective People Finder Specializing in Affair Investigations, Fraud Investigation, and Errand Center]. It was a ridiculously long name.</p>, <p>Tudor began to mutter to herself, contemplating the “gift” she would send to Park Kwang-lim.</p>, <p>“Food poisoning? No, perhaps pneumonia would be more fitting for the current mood. Though Orthodox, a traffic accident isn’t a bad idea either…”</p>, <p>…Tudor was a witch.</p>, <p>If you ever received an unexpected gift from Tudor, stop whatever you’re doing and immediately seek out the nearest church.</p>, <p>If you can make it to the church without encountering an accident, you might find a way to either break the curse or at least minimize its damage.</p>, <p>It wasn’t to save Park Kwang-lim, but I distracted Tudor by engaging her in conversation.</p>, <p>“Now that I’ve warmed up, it seems like a good time to raise the difficulty level of my tasks.”</p>, <p>“…So that’s why you brought up this topic?”</p>, <p>“Not exactly. It’s just that something like that happened.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… Indeed, the tasks you’ve been assigned were intern-level work, prepared to help you adapt to our environment more easily.”</p>, <p>“I thought as much.”</p>, <p>The tasks handled after the capture of the wanted criminal Lee Chang-hyuk were a series of typical tutorial quests.</p>, <p>Transporting secure items, defending key points, sabotaging secret equipment held by rival organizations, and today’s pursuit quest.</p>, <p>There were various types of tasks, but generally, they were simple, low-difficulty ones that could be completed within half a day.</p>, <p>“I’m really satisfied with how this task turned out. I didn’t expect it to be resolved so quickly without any additional support. Impressive indeed.”</p>, <p>Tudor’s expression brightened up. It seemed likely that Park Kwang-lim would avoid his crisis.</p>, <p>“There was no need to set a testing period for me from the start.”</p>, <p>“Hehe, your performance has proven itself, so I can’t argue with that. But to become a reliable and trustworthy broker, you need to do everything with certainty.”</p>, <p>She had a point. Regardless of my achievements, Tudor would have proceeded according to the schedule set in the game.</p>, <p>Anyway, now that I have completed a total of five quests including the introductory one, it seems that more complicated cases will start coming in.</p>, <p>“But not today. I think you’ll be busy for a while and won’t be able to work.”</p>, <p>“Busy?”</p>, <p>“Yes, now that your new identity is ready, you’ll have to take care of things you couldn’t do before, right?”</p>, <p>“I was wondering what you were referring to. So, my ID card has finally arrived?”</p>, <p>“That’s right. You’re now officially a Korean citizen capable of engaging in credit transactions.”</p>, <p>“It feels strange when you say it like that.”</p>, <p>I smiled wryly and tapped the mask with my fingers.</p>, <p>A sudden event had reset everything in my life, including my identity and nationality… These were aspects I had never once felt the need to be thankful for possessing.</p>, <p>But now I had to pay exorbitant prices to get such basic necessities.</p>, <p>“Here, take your identification first.”</p>, <p>Tudor handed me a small envelope. Inside were an ID card and a bank book.</p>, <p>“Didn’t it take longer than expected to get ready?”</p>, <p>“Recently, crackdowns on illegal immigrants have been strengthened not only in Paju but nationwide, so there was a bit of a delay.”</p>, <p>Is the foreigner management office on a roll? What a pain in the ass.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>I, Kim Shin-hwa, was definitely a Korean, born and raised in South Korea.</p>, <p>However, if I was apprehended by the officials of the immigration bureau, I would be classified as an illegal resident without any question.</p>, <p>In [Cthulhu World], South Korea granted surreal powers and authority to the immigration bureau to deal with the surreal issues occurring both inside and outside the country.</p>, <p>There was the issue of North Korean refugees, and in the Cthulhu Mythos, outsiders were always ominous beings bringing disaster. And there were even bigger problems than that.</p>, <p>I frowned for a moment, but Tudor, who couldn’t tell what kind of expression I was making because of the mask, cheerfully continued the conversation.</p>, <p>“But all this is because I want to give you the best; you understand, right?”</p>, <p>“Well, I suppose so.”</p>, <p>“By the way… you.”</p>, <p>“Yes?”</p>, <p>“How did you make that photo?”</p>, <p>That photo? Oh, is she talking about this?</p>, <p>I glanced briefly at the photo on my ID card. At first glance, it looked like a blurry image, as if out of focus. But a closer look revealed that it was indeed a properly taken photo.</p>, <p>It was a fake face I had created using a few illusion spells and other complex methods.</p>, <p>I meticulously adjusted the placement and size of the facial features and also arranged an outfit and background that induced visual hypnosis through their color scheme.</p>, <p>An excessively ordinary face that appeared similar to many yet resembled none.</p>, <p>Since it was intentionally stripped of any uniqueness, no matter how carefully one looked at the photo, it was impossible to recall the face from memory later.</p>, <p>“Why is that?”</p>, <p>“I think people might want more of something similar if you could make it…”</p>, <p>Ah, was that what she meant?</p>, <p>Apparently, Tudor had realized the significance of this photo.</p>, <p>“It’s not easy to make… And if too many are made, the effect diminishes.”</p>, <p>“Hmm, no worries. It was just a fun idea I had. Don’t mind it. Go ahead and check your bank book.”</p>, <p>At Tudor’s urging, I opened my bank account and found that it contained exactly 50 million won.</p>, <p>[50,000,000]</p>, <p>“That’s a lot of money, isn’t it?”</p>, <p>“The compensation for this job was 10 million won, and I added a little more as a bonus, making it exactly fifty.”</p>, <p>Since Lee Chang-hyuk, I had asked for all my earnings from the jobs I solved to be kept aside. There should be about forty-five million, but it seems Tudor added a few extra million.</p>, <p>Considering the cash stacked up in my room, I had now saved over one hundred million won. After finishing the next task, it might be worth considering getting my own place.</p>, <p>“And this.”</p>, <p>Tudor handed me a smartphone.</p>, <p>It’s the latest model with a large screen.</p>, <p>“Where do you find a fixer who stays cooped up and only comes out when it’s convenient to accept a job and then disappears? I got this activated so I can contact you whenever it’s convenient for me. Answer when I call.”</p>, <p>When I turned on the screen, I found Tudor’s contact information already saved.</p>, <p>“Hmm… Nice. Thanks.”</p>, <p>“It’s rare to hear a ‘thank you’ from you. You really do have an expensive mouth.”</p>, <p>“Anyway, you’re saying you’ll put me to work seriously, right? Let’s continue the conversation about the task you mentioned earlier.”</p>, <p>“That’s right. I’m investing money in this, so be prepared to be fully used.”</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>In roughly a month, I acquired an ID card, a bank account, and a smartphone.</p>, <p>These are the basic items typically required in Korea to prove your identity.</p>, <p>“It would be even better if I had a job.”</p>, <p>I’m talking about a normal and common-sense job in the world, not as a fixer or a mage.</p>, <p>As my work as a fixer increases, I’ll be handling more money.</p>, <p>This might not pose a problem in the short term, but in the long term, there’s a risk of getting caught up in tax investigations or similar issues.</p>, <p>When I was simply playing the game [Cthulhu World], I never encountered such frustrating events… But now, in this real world, most humans live in a way similar to actual reality.</p>, <p>I operated the smartphone and accessed the internet. A quick search led me to find the gaming community and the vast wiki site I used to visit in reality.</p>, <p><em>The details have changed a bit, but…</em></p>, <p>While it wasn’t exactly the same, the community was still active. On the humor board, posts lacked their value but were creative nonetheless, and numerous people mixed their slang and buzzwords into comments on these humor posts.</p>, <p>The difference in trending words and details from reality wasn’t a problem. The important thing was that in the game [Cthulhu World] I had enjoyed, there were no such communities or pointless humor boards.</p>, <p>Perhaps it’s more accurate to say they weren’t depicted? After all, a game implements only what’s necessary for gameplay.</p>, <p>However, humans here moved in their unique ways as each had their own will and thoughts. Overlooking real-world issues by considering this merely a game world could lead to unexpected problems.</p>, <p>And there was one more thing.</p>, <p>There was a real problem that needed solving.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>“How much?”</p>, <p>“Just a studio apartment will do. Somewhere with cheap rent.”</p>, <p>Conducting real estate transactions while wearing a mask was no easy task.</p>, <p>Therefore, the day after I received my ID, I visited a shabby real estate agency located on the outskirts of Geumchon through Tudor’s introduction.</p>, <p>The owner of the office was an old lady whose appearance was so suspicious that it wouldn’t have been strange if she suddenly started chuckling creepily.</p>, <p>In fact, as a place catering to those with unclear identities, it was an office that could conduct transactions even without an ID card. But the presence or absence of this single ID card drastically changed the amount I had to pay.</p>, <p>“There are a few nearby. Want to see them?”</p>, <p>“If it’s possible, I’d like to see and choose.”</p>, <p>“Hmph, how troublesome…”</p>, <p>The main customers of this establishment seemed to have a habit of signing contracts without even viewing the rooms. It made sense, considering the place itself offered no sense of trust or eagerness to provide service to its clients.</p>, <p>The map clumsily attached to the wall depicted what Paju looked like 30 years ago, and the coating on the consultation table was so worn out that the areas touched by customers’ hands were dented and looked glossy black.</p>, <p>Despite its state, the properties they introduced were fortunately quite decent.</p>, <p>I didn’t have to spend much time looking around; after visiting just a couple of places, I promptly signed a contract.</p>, <p>The place was compact but could be considered fully equipped, and most importantly, it was within walking distance from Vasilisa.</p>, <p>Since I hardly had any belongings to call luggage, moving was a breeze and it was completed with just a round trip from the motel right after the contract was signed.</p>, <p>Quiet and clean. Not bad at all.</p>, <p>Like the motel, it had a refrigerator but here, there was also a washing machine, a sink for simple cooking, and even a rice cooker.</p>, <p>I felt slightly better. What I especially liked was the fact that I could handle cooking and laundry on my own.</p>, <p>As soon as I unpacked my things, I planned to catch up on laundry and buy groceries to cook.</p>, <p>But that was just a thought.</p>, <p>The penalty traits clinging to my body were not issues that could be easily overcome.</p>, <p>Due to the [Weakned Stamina] trait, I was already exhausted after unpacking my belongings.</p>, <p>So I ended up skipping both meals and laundry and simply lay down on the bed.</p>, <p>“Aaah…”</p>, <p>Lying down really is the best.</p>, <p>For a moment, I thought the bed’s springs were overly bouncy, but it was much better than the creaky bed at the motel anyway.</p>, <p>I also liked that the ceiling was covered with white wallpaper.</p>, <p>Just escaping the motel with its garishly colored, chaotic wallpapers made this move worthwhile.</p>, <p>Having given up on both eating and laundry, the only thing left to do was something I could do while lying down.</p>, <p><em>Poom…</em></p>, <p>I spread my arms wide towards the white ceiling, and various forms of magic circles arose from my outstretched arms.</p>, <p>They were magic circles of various colors and irregular shapes, enough to shock anyone who had learned magic through a normal succession process.</p>, <p>There was no need to adhere to symmetry, regularity, or the standardized forms designed following traditional methods.</p>, <p>Instead of simplifying to the most primal form, I calculated each magic circle to exert influence on one another, creating an incredibly efficient and unbridled effect.</p>, <p>In an instant, the interior of my studio apartment became isolated from the outside world.</p>, <p>Now, no one could peek in or enter without my permission. Of course, beings beyond the ordinary might force their way in, but for such entities, I installed several magical traps and alarm spells for security.</p>, <p>This should be sufficient for now. After all, I have no intention of staying long in this seemingly ineffective, ordinary studio.</p>, <p>In the [Cthulhu World], there are residences that offer magical benefits simply by owning or living in them.</p>, <p>Some even come with incredible features like underground dungeons for leveling up or grinding.</p>, <p>Of course, to acquire such a place, I need to level up further.</p>, <p><em>Or have enough money to disregard such needs entirely.</em></p>, <p>But for now, that’s not the case.</p>, <p>“Anyway, today that was pretty good.”</p>, <p>I recalled the makeshift skateboard I had rigged up to handle a race event with a gang of street bikers. It was almost a desperate idea, but it turned out better than expected.</p>, <p>In [Cthulhu World], there are enchantment spells to strengthen the body or objects. However, the number of enchantments that can be applied to a target is limited, and the more enchantments applied, the greater the strain on the target.</p>, <p>Therefore, it’s preferred to attach magic circles to personal items rather than directly to the body and aim for an indirect effect.</p>, <p>Focusing mobility-related enchantments on the skateboard seemed like a good move, especially since walking was too exhausting for me due to the [Weakned Stamina] debuff.</p>, <p>Wouldn’t skateboarding be a good way to compensate for the physical limitations of being exhausted just by moving a little indoors?</p>, <p><em>But there’s no artifact in the form of a board…</em></p>, <p>Should I carve something like a sacred tree myself? All I have to do is attach wheels to a plank, right?</p>, <p>However, crafting is influenced by agility, and I wasn’t confident I could make it properly.</p>, <p>For the time being, I might just buy a couple of decent ones and use them until they wear out. After all, as I continue to level up, I should be able to offset the weakened stamina effect.</p>, <p>As I lay down and stared blankly at the ceiling, I gradually felt sleep creeping in.</p>, <p>“Should I go to sleep now?”</p>, <p>I was tired.</p>, <p>It had been just over a month, but I had been incredibly busy.</p>, <p>Thanks to Tudor’s considerate help, I had primarily focused on low-difficulty quests. However, even those proved not easy for my frail body which was laden with various penalties.</p>, <p>Wouldn’t it be better to increase the difficulty of the quests while also extending rest periods? I wasn’t sure about other aspects, but this strategy seemed like it would accelerate my growth rate.</p>, <p><em>Well, from now on, I’ll be given more serious quests… I guess I don’t need to worry about this anymore.</em></p>, <p>I wanted to think more, to plan more, but I was too sleepy. My head felt dizzy. I hadn’t slept well for a month, tormented by nightmares every night.</p>, <p>My eyes stung and my eyelids were heavy.

            "[<p>As with every night spent in the [Cthulhu World], the previous night’s dream was among the worst imaginable.</p>, <p>Endless underground tunnels, the stench of decaying corpses.</p>, <p>A chant echoed continuously in a murmuring voice.</p>, <p><strong>Down, down, deeper down. Descend deeper down.</strong></p>, <p>Descending the spiral staircase into the infinite depths of darkness.</p>, <p>At some point, the seemingly never-ending staircase abruptly ended, revealing a secret cavern hidden beneath the earth.</p>, <p>There lay an underground lake that stretched endlessly in breadth.</p>, <p>But it wasn’t water that filled the lake.</p>, <p>Everywhere I looked, there were corpses upon corpses and vile creatures like worms and beasts feasting on the rotten flesh of these bodies.</p>, <p>In a darkness so stifling it seemed even death could suffocate, there was a grotesque feast unfolding, designed for devouring the flesh of the dead… such was the nature of this dream.</p>, <p>It was no ordinary dream.</p>, <p>It was a message sent by the beings of the abyss to destroy my mind, to grasp me in their clutches.</p>, <p>A dream that shatters the soul of the person who experiences it and makes it impossible for them to live the same life as before.</p>, <p>But I was already mad, so it was okay.</p>, <p>No, that’s not quite it… If I hadn’t possessed the trait [Madness of the Abyss], I would have lost my mind long ago.</p>, <p>Leaving aside such nightmarish dreams, it’s been three days since I got a new house.</p>, <p><em>Rrrrrr</em>–</p>, <p>Over these three days, I’ve managed to furnish the house with the essentials, and now I’ve regained enough stability to actually cook and eat my own meals.</p>, <p><em>Rrrrrr</em>–</p>, <p>Then I made up my mind and bought a proper skateboard.</p>, <p>Riding the board isn’t exactly easy, but in my case since I’m not physically riding it, it’s not much different from riding an electric scooter to be honest.</p>, <p>The telekinesis conjured by magical power secured my body atop the board.</p>, <p>I supplied magical power to the wheels created for rotation to keep moving the board forward.</p>, <p>There is no need for actions like pushing off with my feet.</p>, <p>With a bit more focus, I could even force the board to perform tricks similar to those done on skateboards and accelerate faster than a motorcycle.</p>, <p>At first, the vibration from the wheels was a problem, jolting all the way to my head, but I solved it by using magic to forcibly neutralize it.</p>, <p>But setting all that aside…</p>, <p><em>It’s incredibly convenient.</em></p>, <p>I didn’t have to walk, and I could maneuver indoors or over complex terrains.</p>, <p>Even terrains typically unsuitable for a board were no issue. I could force it to move with magical power. If I set my mind to it, I could traverse deserts or jungles without any trouble.</p>, <p><em>Maybe in the future, when I can afford it, I’ll pay a craftsman somewhere to make me a magic board or something.</em></p>, <p>I planned to create a high-performance custom board slathered with artifacts and magic.</p>, <p>Still, I had settled near Vasilisa.</p>, <p>While riding my board I could have reached Vasilisa in about five minutes, but I intentionally roamed the dark back alleys and rooftops of the Geumchon neighborhood, whirling around before heading towards Vasilisa.</p>, <p>This was partly to avoid any potential tailing or tracking of my movements, but honestly, more than half the reason was simply the exhilaration I felt riding the board.</p>, <p>Given the dire circumstances and conditions I faced, a change of mood was essential. To stay sane, I needed to eat delicious food and maintain positive thoughts.</p>, <p>Enjoying the delightful speed, defying physics with leaps, and spinning through the air, I finally reached the deepest part of the Geumchon neighborhood’s damp and dark back alleys.</p>, <p>There, out of place in such a setting and time, was a peculiar café with a stylish exterior that was open for business.</p>, <p>Café Vasilisa was a café run by a witch who lived for a long time, and at the same time, it was a café for fixers wandering the darkness of Paju.</p>, <p>When I entered Vasilisa, a tall barista with a large spherical monitor for a head, Orb, greeted me in a mechanically synthesized voice that unnaturally broke off.</p>, <p><em>– Hel.lo? Kim. Shin-hwa.</em></p>, <p>“Hi, Orb. Got anything to chew on besides drinks?”</p>, <p><em>– Home. Made. Sandwich? Tasty.</em></p>, <p>Hmm… Can I really call a sandwich made by Orb a homemade sandwich? Well, the body beneath the head is human, so… anyway, it doesn’t matter.</p>, <p>“Then, I’ll have that and an iced Americano. I’m not eating here, so please pack it up.”</p>, <p><em>– Just. A. Moment.</em></p>, <p>While I waited for Orb to prepare the sandwich, someone suddenly approached me and struck up a conversation.</p>, <p>“Hey, masked friend.”</p>, <p>“Uh.”</p>, <p>Shiny bald head with bulging muscles. He was one of the fixers who had laughed at me on my first day at Vasilisa. Always lounging in the café, gobbling down stuff like parfaits… but why approach me all of a sudden?</p>, <p>“Your name is Kim Shin-hwa, right? Is that your real name?”</p>, <p>“Is that why you started talking to me?”</p>, <p>“Ah, such a cold response! My name is…”</p>, <p>“Wait, stop!”</p>, <p>“What’s the matter…?”</p>, <p>I broke into a cold sweat.</p>, <p>Ah, shit… I remembered this dimwitted bald mercenary’s… This man’s name. I even knew his real name.</p>, <p>“No need to introduce yourself; I already know your name!”</p>, <p>This man’s name was Kang Il-sam. His fixer name that he used as a fixer….it was a word that read as a certain number in English. To use such an unpleasant, ominous, horrible, evil, superstitious, unlucky number as a name, what was he thinking?</p>, <p>“Ah, you already know my name? That’s an honor. Well, my fixer name is Thir…”</p>, <p>“Why did you approach me? What do you want?”</p>, <p>I spoke without taking a breath to force him to stop speaking.</p>, <p>Just thinking about Kang Il-sam’s name… even the thought sent shivers down my spine. Anyway, the bald man looked momentarily perplexed; even with my mask on, it was evident something was off about me.</p>, <p>Without the mask, my reason for acting this way would have been completely exposed.</p>, <p>“Ah, right. It’s nothing…”</p>, <p>He hesitated for a moment, then shrugged his shoulders and pointed at me with both hands.</p>, <p>“Kim Shin-hwa, you’ve been quite the rising star lately, so I just wanted to say hi.”</p>, <p>“Ah… I see.”</p>, <p>So what? It’s curious why someone who isn’t the type to start conversations like this would do so. But his name keeps disrupting my focus and concentration.</p>, <p><em>I thought my dream was disturbing for some reason…</em></p>, <p>No, it’s not working. I need to wrap this up quickly.</p>, <p>“Thanks for your interest. But today’s not a good day for me…”</p>, <p>He should just vanish in such a way that he would never be seen by me… that’s a bit extreme. I can’t exactly tell him to go change his name and come back, can I? Even though I hadn’t finished speaking, it seems my gestures of refusal and rejection were clear enough. He looked a bit troubled as he started speaking.</p>, <p>“Hey, don’t be like that. It’s a good offer; just hear me out.”</p>, <p>“What is it?”</p>, <p>“Seems like you’ve been working solo for a while. Aren’t you interested in joining a team?”</p>, <p>Ah, so that was it… an invitation to join his team? The results of my recent work weren’t bad, but there hadn’t been anything as significant as the Lee Chang-hyuk incident to gain such fame…And the same thing happened with Park Kwang-lim last time; it seems Tudor has been doing things behind the scenes to promote my name.</p>, <p>“Working alone has its limits, right? Some tasks require a number of people to back you up, regardless of skill… And you’re a mage, aren’t you? Having a reliable colleague, like a hearty bowl of gukbap, to cover your front would surely make earning money a lot easier, wouldn’t it?”</p>, <p>Sorry, but I dislike it because of your awful name. No, that’s not it.</p>, <p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t plan on joining any group for the time being.”</p>, <p>“Don’t be like that. We can still be close without officially joining, like a guest member. For a mage like you, we’d offer the best share. I stake my <strong>Name </strong>on it.”</p>, <p>“No, what I mean is…”</p>, <p>Please just leave with your terrible name and don’t hang it over me… If this conversation continued, I might either go mad or lose my temper and beat him up.</p>, <p>Fortunately, the conversation ended in an unexpected way.</p>, <p>“Oh dear, you’re here? Are you going to eat that sandwich here?”</p>, <p>When I turned my head, I saw Tudor wearing a wide-brimmed cone hat standing looking down at me with a playful expression on her face.</p>, <p>She was already tall, but in high heels it was impossible to meet her gaze without looking up.</p>, <p>“No, I’ll take it to go.”</p>, <p>“Why don’t you just lift your mask a bit to eat?”</p>, <p>I got goosebumps.</p>, <p>Why is she like this? Asking to slightly remove the mask in such a crowded place?</p>, <p>With triskaidekaphobia (fear of 13) already etched in my mind, I had to suppress another madness threatening to emerge… mask obsession. I had to quickly change the topic.</p>, <p>I was caught between a rock and a hard place. Tudor insisting on removing the mask and the bald man trying to say his name! I had no choice but to give up on the relationship I had built with Tudor and everyone…</p>, <p>“Well, that doesn’t really matter. Sorry, but can I borrow Kim Shin-hwa for a bit?”</p>, <p>Ah, fortunately, it seems my thoughts were just paranoid delusions, a side effect of my mental illness. Tudor winked slyly at the bald man and pulled me away.</p>, <p>“Ah, I don’t know what it is, but favoritism isn’t good.”</p>, <p>The bald man joked, but he didn’t seem to be in a bad mood. For someone with such a terrible name, he seemed to have a good personality.</p>, <p>“Huh? When did I ever show favoritism?”</p>, <p>“I don’t know what it is, but I’m hungry. If it’s about work, let’s get it over with quickly. I want to go eat my sandwich.”</p>, <p>I would slit the throat of an abyssal being if I could just get this over with.</p>, <p>“Hmm, okay. And Thirteen, I have something to ask of you, so… don’t go anywhere and wait for me.”</p>, <p>“Ah, got it.”</p>, <p>I ended up hearing it! Wow, how can a person’s name be that? No, why in the world would someone choose such a nickname?</p>, <p>I felt like screaming, but fortunately, mere fleeting hearing didn’t trigger my mental illness. If it were that sensitive, I would have fainted even at the sight of phone numbers on signs while passing by.</p>, <p>Ah… damn it… How the hell do I erase this mental illness…</p>, <p>Anyway, I left the bald fixer with the terrible name…. behind and headed to Tudor’s office. I’m not sure how my gait looked, but it seemed extremely awkward. Fixers who were slowly getting used to my mask looked at me with puzzled expressions before speaking to the bald man.</p>, <p>“Hey, what did you say to that masked guy to make him act like that?”</p>, <p>“Who knows? I just proposed teaming up…”</p>, <p>“Aaah, then it makes sense he’d be upset.”</p>, <p>“What did you say?”</p>, <p>Then followed the sound of hearty laughter. He didn’t seem like a bad person, but I’m sorry; I just can’t associate with someone with such a name.</p>, <p>As soon as I sat down in the office chair, Tudor handed me a stack of documents.</p>, <p>The first page had a large photo of a construction site attached to it.</p>, <p>“An apartment complex?”</p>, <p>“Exactly. It’s a flashy, chic apartment going up near Munsan Station.”</p>, <p>Munsan Station is just three stops away on the Gyeongui-Jungang Line from here in Geumchon.</p>, <p>I’m not sure how it was in the reality I lived in, but redevelopment was in full swing in [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>“Let’s see… The building is almost complete; only the finishing touches are left. So what’s the problem?”</p>, <p>“A ghoul popped out of the underground parking lot.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Ghouls.</p>, <p>This is a different race that first appeared in the works of Lovecraft and was later adapted into [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>They possess intelligence comparable to that of humans, complete with their own language, culture, and religious beliefs.</p>, <p>Depending on the person, some seek their help or attempt to interact with them, often leading to significantly positive outcomes from such exchanges.</p>, <p>However, these beings are entirely different from the races of the fantasy world like elves or dwarfs.</p>, <p>If I had to draw a comparison…. they are closer to orcs or even lower evil creatures.</p>, <p>Ghouls are denizens of the darkness dwelling underground.</p>, <p>They possess bodies resembling humans but have grotesque heads similar to dogs.</p>, <p>And they had the bizarre custom of feeding on human corpses and even resorting to cannibalism among their own kind when food was scarce.</p>, <p>Simply put, they were man-eaters</p>, <p>No matter what kind of intelligence and culture they had, from a human perspective, they were nothing more than monsters that needed to be eradicated and erased from the face of the earth.</p>, <p>Anyway, such monsters emerged from the underground of a construction site for a new apartment building…</p>, <p>“Of all places, a commotion in the apartment building site, it must be incredibly noisy, right?”</p>, <p>“Not yet.”</p>, <p>“Not yet?”</p>, <p>Tudor continued with a smile.</p>, <p>“It hasn’t spread yet. The construction company and investors are pouring in a tremendous amount of money to suppress the rumors as much as possible. Thanks to that, it’s still quiet for now.”</p>, <p>“But even if they bring in outsiders like this to block it, they can’t completely cover it up, can they?”</p>, <p>“It’s already too late to stop it as if nothing happened. Anyway, it seems they want the rumor to spread that it’s already been resolved.”</p>, <p>“Hmph, the actions of these corporations are the same here as they were there.”</p>, <p>“Here and there?”</p>, <p>No, here is now there, and there is now here.</p>, <p>Ugh… How much longer will I have to play this unexpected role of a fixer?</p>, <p>Honestly, I wouldn’t mind not making money; I just want to return to my original world where it’s safe and peaceful.</p>, <p>“No, it’s nothing important; don’t worry about it.”</p>, <p>“Hmmm~?”</p>, <p>Tudor briefly showed a curious expression in her face, but when I said nothing more, she sighed lightly and continued.</p>, <p>“Anyway, the client wants it dealt with as quickly as possible.”</p>, <p>“Aha, so they’re looking for someone who can deliver the most firepower relative to their numbers? For example…”</p>, <p>Like a sole mage such as myself.</p>, <p>“Right. Besides, it’s rare to find a mage who works alone like you do.”</p>, <p>“They must be paying well?”</p>, <p>“With confidentiality and other allowances included… exactly five sheets.”</p>, <p>50 million won…</p>, <p>Starting from Lee Chang-hyuk, all the money I earned in a month from arresting drug addicts, murderers, and gang leaders… barely amounted to 50 million won, even when including the bonuses. But 50 million won for just one job is no joke.</p>, <p>“Starting when?”</p>, <p>“They said they’re looking for someone who can do it discreetly and quickly, remember? Can you start right away, today?”</p>, <p>“Today?”</p>, <p>I frowned for a moment and took my time. My expression was hidden behind the mask, so it wouldn’t have been visible anyway.</p>, <p>The several million won bonus that had silently appeared in my bank account.</p>, <p>Looks like it wasn’t meaningless after all.</p>, <p>As my skills improved, so did the expectations placed upon me and with increased expectations came better treatment.</p>, <p>And with better treatment, more demanding jobs would come my way; such was the structure of this field.</p>, <p>“Just now, I caught a biker gang member, didn’t I? And now you’re asking me to take on another job?”</p>, <p>“Is it too much?”</p>, <p>Tudor’s tone seemed less concerned and more provocative.</p>, <p>I was tempted to immediately say I’d just go there right away, but I knew that depending on my physical condition, it might indeed be too much.</p>, <p>“Just a moment…”</p>, <p>I didn’t respond immediately; instead I started rubbing my wrist and assessing my physical state.</p>, <p>I carefully moved my magical power to check the fatigue accumulated in my body and the stress I hadn’t fully shaken off.</p>, <p>“I’m not in a state where I can’t do it.”</p>, <p>Although I was tired from the intense chase I had just completed, it wasn’t problematic.</p>, <p>“Alright. That’s more like it.”</p>, <p>[You’ve accepted the quest!</p>, <p>&lt;Hunting Quest: Guests from the Underworld&gt;</p>, <p>Ghouls have appeared in the underground of an apartment building under construction.</p>, <p>Defeat the ghouls and make the underground parking lot ‘safe’.</p>, <p>Remaining number: 0/20</p>, <p>Reward: 350,000 XP (+ the monetary reward promised by the broker is separate.) Failure: Hostile relationship with Yeonam Construction.]</p>, <p>Yeonam Construction was the name of the construction company that commissioned the quest.</p>, <p>Yeonam Construction itself was not particularly remarkable, but the Yeonam Group behind it was a major corporation with considerable scale and influence.</p>, <p>Moreover, while these people were not as troublesome as Helistic who had demanded the capture of Lee Chang-hyuk, they were still not to be underestimated.</p>, <p>Becoming their enemy wouldn’t just make life difficult; it would turn life into hard mode. Essentially, it meant game over.</p>, <p>“Alright. I will arrange transportation for you to rest and go immediately.”</p>, <p>“Transportation?”</p>, <p>“Well, it’s a bit of a distance to Munsan Station. You’re not planning to take the train, are you?”</p>, <p>“Me, I don’t mind how I travel.”</p>, <p>“Hahaha, sure you might not, but for the peace and well-being of the ordinary citizens of Paju, take a taxi.”</p>, <p>“Aren’t taxi drivers citizens of Paju?”</p>, <p>“This is a bit serious, but remember when I said that the crackdown on illegal immigrants has become more severe these days? I’ll call a secure taxi for you. Use it for the return trip too.”</p>, <p>“Oh, a secure taxi.”</p>, <p>The drivers of secure taxis were certainly not your average citizens of Paju.</p>, <p>“From now on, whenever there’s a job, I’ll contact you through that smartphone. You know how to use it, right?”</p>, <p>Tudor smiled briefly and winked at me.</p>, <p>“…It’s not that I don’t carry it around because I don’t know how to use it.”</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The day’s destination was Munsan town in Paju City.</p>, <p>More specifically, it was a newly constructed luxury apartment complex in one part of Munsan town.</p>, <p>Its name was [Paju Yeonam Rivertown Apartment].</p>, <p>Really, why do they give apartments such unnecessarily long names?</p>, <p>Through the rear window of the taxi, the apartment started to come into view.</p>, <p>Although not yet finished, it looked as if it would be ready for occupation in a month or two if only the finishing touches to the exterior painting were completed.</p>, <p>The building was quite spacious and ridiculously tall for no apparent reason.</p>, <p><em>I bet the underground parking lot is incredibly spacious too.</em></p>, <p>The underground parking lot, as depicted in the game, was ridiculously large.</p>, <p>It was almost like a dungeon, stretching down to the second subterranean level.</p>, <p><em>That must be really tiring to navigate…</em></p>, <p>At this time, a voice came from an unexpected direction.</p>, <p>“Why on earth would someone build such a huge apartment complex here?”</p>, <p>It was the voice of the taxi driver currently at the wheel.</p>, <p>I momentarily shifted my gaze to look at the driver’s face reflected in the taxi’s rearview mirror.</p>, <p>Reflected in the cramped rearview mirror were just the corners of the taxi driver’s eyes, but the deep lines and scars etched around them were clearly visible.</p>, <p>He was scowling at the approaching apartment and his rugged face contorted.</p>, <p>Watching the driver’s expression, I couldn’t help but let out a wry smile.</p>, <p>In Paju, security taxis that transport criminals, illegal goods, or personnel are jobs suited for retired fixers or monster hunters who can no longer do such jobs.</p>, <p>In short, this man was definitely not your average citizen of Paju.</p>, <p>I slowly responded to the taxi driver’s comment.</p>, <p>“What I’m more curious about is why people in Paju would choose to live in such apartments?”</p>, <p>Paju in [Cthulhu World] is a city filled with extraordinary and unprecedented dangers, and the location of this apartment is exceptionally bizarre, even by those standards.</p>, <p>An apartment situated far too north.</p>, <p>Built almost clinging to the terrifying Imjin River… a high-rise?</p>, <p>“Hahaha, well, the view must be something else. From those high floors, you can probably see beyond the Imjin River.”</p>, <p>True to the taxi driver’s words, from the higher floors of this apartment you could easily gaze out over the land beyond the Imjin River.</p>, <p>“Though, I doubt that view is good for mental health…”</p>, <p>In [Cthulhu World], there is no North Korea beyond the Imjin River.</p>, <p>Instead, it was nothing but a land of death where mythical Cthulhu monsters that poured from the abyss roamed.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, I heard that the apartments were sold incredibly quickly.</p>, <p>There was even a significant premium for the floors with a good view.</p>, <p>What kind of scenery were the people moving into these apartments expecting?</p>, <p>The taxi driver grumbled for quite a while about how the rich in Paju were either insane or not even human.</p>, <p>Well… the fact that non-human entities were mixed among Paju’s wealthy wasn’t exactly a big secret.</p>, <p>In any case, we soon arrived at our destination as we exchanged such conversations.</p>, <p>“Here we are.”</p>, <p>[Paju Yeonam Rivertown Apartment]</p>, <p>Through the car window, I could see the fence separating the construction site.</p>, <p>A crazy apartment complex being built to satisfy the bizarre tastes of the wealthy who walk a path not human.</p>, <p>The interior remains unseen from the outside.</p>, <p>Anyway, beneath that apartment now, there were cannibalistic ghouls that feasted on human corpses.</p>, <p>“Thank you for your hard work.”</p>, <p>There was no need to calculate the taxi fare since Tudor had already paid in advance.</p>, <p>“Take care of yourself too, and let’s meet again, alive and well.”</p>, <p>“May you live a long life too, sir.”</p>, <p>“I always do safe jobs, so no worries!”</p>, <p>With those words, the taxi driver laughed heartily again and drove off.</p>, <p>Safe jobs, huh… Today was indeed a safe job, but even security taxis are part of Paju’s back alley’s semi-legal services.</p>, <p>Depending on the client’s requests, tomorrow I might have to engage in a life-threatening chase to aid a bank robber or a wanted criminal in their escape.</p>, <p>“Well, that aside…”</p>, <p>I briefly turned my head, looking in the direction opposite the apartment… towards the Imjin River.</p>, <p>In the world I used to live in, there would be the vast Imjin River stretching in the direction I was looking.</p>, <p>But what met my eyes was a massive wall with an unsightly appearance.</p>, <p><em>This must be the Great Wall.</em></p>, <p>I had often seen it in the game, but when you see it in real life, it was a massive structure with an overwhelming sense of intimidation.</p>, <p>And then there was the surreal threat that necessitated the creation of a huge barrier wall, 10 meters in height, to isolate it.</p>, <p>There was no sound but for some reason, it seemed like I could hear a deep resonating ‘Gooooo…’.</p>, <p>The real threat of monsters existing and such monsters swarming around the Imjin River, where apartments had been erected.</p>, <p>And the sight of the wealthy longing to move into such apartments could be, as the taxi driver said, the manifestation of some kind of madness.</p>, <p>I paused and tapped my finger against the mask.</p>, <p>“Well, it’s not the time to mock other people’s madness.”</p>, <p>To adapt and live in this crazy world means, after all, becoming accustomed to madness.</p>, <p>With that thought, I entered the apartment complex that was erected right beside the wall that contained the monsters.</p>, <p>That Paju River something-or-other… Anyway, it seemed the construction of the apartment building was already in its final stages.</p>, <p>The sudden appearance of ghouls and the ensuing chaos had caused the workers to flee, leaving construction materials scattered haphazardly. But still, the apartment in question was already in a very nice condition.</p>, <p>How many months would it need then? No, from the looks of it, I wouldn’t be surprised if they started moving in within the next few weeks. Although the finishing touches were not yet complete, the visible facilities and the layout of the buildings clearly indicated that this was a luxury apartment constructed with a great investment.</p>, <p><em>It certainly seems to be in a state that justifies the hurried progress and the considerable funds invested.</em></p>, <p>However, apart from the luxury of the apartment site, the pervasive malevolent aura throughout the space was unnaturally strong.</p>, <p>It was a dreadful energy that couldn’t simply be attributed to a few lurking ghouls.</p>, <p>A few steps further and a trait that hadn’t been activated for a while now sprang into action.</p>, <p>[System: The trait ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ has been activated.]</p>]\n",

Is this some kind of joke?</p>, <p>For a moment, I seriously considered abandoning the quest and returning to the motel.</p>, <p>After finishing this quest, I could achieve the feat of slaying 100 ghouls.</p>, <p>“Huh? But…wait a minute.”</p>, <p>The information provided by the system only went so far, but my magically enhanced senses, which had evolved beyond that, detected several unexpected pieces of information.</p>, <p>It was…a unique sensation that I had not experienced when playing the game.</p>, <p>Humans.</p>, <p>Among the ghouls moving underground, there was clearly a presence with a different kind of magical power.</p>, <p>So… there were humans among the underground ghouls.</p>, <p>Four humans, then five, and one more.</p>, <p>A total of six.</p>, <p>[The number of life forms matching the conditions is 128.]</p>, <p>One had died.</p>, <p>The magical presence I had detected disappeared.</p>, <p>[The number of life forms matching the conditions is 127.]</p>, <p>Now there were only five humans left.</p>, <p>“Ah, wait, wait, wait…!”</p>, <p>[The number of life forms matching the conditions is 125.]</p>, <p>Another one, no, two people died at once.</p>, <p>The remaining survivors totaled three.</p>, <p>“Stop, you!”</p>, <p>I hastily stretched my hand towards the ground.</p>, <p>I poured my magical power indiscriminately toward the underground, but there was no time to construct a complex form of magic anew.</p>, <p>I transformed and strengthened the nature of the magical power lines sent down for detection.</p>, <p>The form was…</p>, <p>[Chains of Domination]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Range Increase]</p>, <p><em>Papapapapapabang!!</em></p>, <p>I gathered the intangible lines of magical power into a few strands of chains with physical force.</p>, <p>Then, moving these chains…</p>, <p>“Euchachachacha!”</p>, <p>It was hard to grasp the situation, but anyway, I beat up all the ghouls that had swarmed around the presumed human magic source.</p>, <p><em>– Screeech!!!</em></p>, <p><em>– Grrrrrr!!!</em></p>, <p>The ghouls’ shrieks echoed eerily from beneath the ground.</p>, <p>I could feel the ghouls, battered by the magically endowed chains, scattering in all directions.</p>, <p>“I did it! Wow, Holy Shit!”</p>, <p>Wow, this actually worked? Do I get an achievement for this?</p>, <p>I remained on all fours, waiting for a moment, but no message window appeared.</p>, <p>It seems it wasn’t the kind of action to warrant an achievement.</p>, <p>Instead of a message window, I heard a human voice from an unexpected direction.</p>, <p>“Mage…nim…?”</p>, <p>A woman’s voice tinged with bewilderment. Someone had come near me after hearing my cheers.</p>, <p>But this was really…such an inconvenient timing.</p>, <p>The humans still hiding underground were in a situation where it was difficult to change their situation completely.</p>, <p>I had no choice but to speak to the woman.</p>, <p>“Just a moment, please wait a little longer; I’m almost done!”</p>, <p>[Enhanced Vigilance] wasn’t sending any alarming signals from her direction, so she probably wasn’t hostile.</p>, <p>And roughly at this point and in this place, hearing a woman’s voice, I had a guess who it might be… It’s alright.</p>, <p>I once again summoned a massive amount of magical power and began to pour it towards the underground.</p>, <p>The magical power emanating from both hands and the soles of my feet began to draw a huge magic circle under the ground according to my will and command.</p>, <p>The intricately glowing lines of magical power and the high-density magic circle radiated an immense light in all directions.</p>, <p>Except for the fact that I, the caster of the magic, was in a somewhat awkward posture, the scene around me transformed into one of spectacular and mystical beauty.</p>, <p>In any case, I cast the spell with the help of the magic circle….and the effect wasn’t just amplifying its range but this was almost to the level of remote activation.</p>, <p>[Flame Eruption]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Range Increase]</p>, <p>The ghouls, undeterred even after being battered by the chains of magical power, were suddenly engulfed by flames pouring down from the ceiling above them.</p>, <p>The humans I saved… there were three in total. Fortunately, it seemed they were still alive.</p>, <p>Though they were still standing in one place without moving, they didn’t look like they were going to die any time soon.</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Range Increase]</p>, <p>This should be enough.</p>, <p>I brushed off the dirt from my knees and palms and stood up.</p>, <p>“What… did you do?”</p>, <p>I turned my head to look at the woman who had spoken to me.</p>, <p>That voice and that appearance.</p>, <p>She may not have recognized me, but she was a pleasantly familiar figure to me. She was someone I had met many times in the game.</p>, <p>“Hello. I’m Kim Shin-hwa, the fixer you contacted through Café Vasilisa.”</p>, <p>“Ah… Yes.”</p>, <p>She hesitated for a moment, struggling to continue her sentence.</p>, <p>It seemed that she was confused by the sight of my face or rather my mask.</p>, <p>However, her discomposure didn’t last long, and she responded to my greeting.</p>, <p>“Hello. I am Moon Seung-hee, the director of Yeonam Construction.”</p>, <p>She’s one of the main NPCs from [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>My first impression of Moon Seung-hee in person, not just as an image on a monitor but as a living, breathing human being, was… like seeing a sculpture.</p>, <p>It’s not just a compliment or an assessment made simply because of her beautiful appearance.</p>, <p>Indeed, no one could belittle her looks.</p>, <p>Her face was literally as neatly and finely lined as if it were carved and polished.</p>, <p>Yet her eyes and expression were cold and firm, like those of a stone or doll, not a living creature.</p>, <p>An unnatural and awkward beauty that seemed to have been artificially created by someone.</p>, <p>That was the impression I got from her appearance.</p>, <p>She couldn’t hold back and pressed me again.</p>, <p>“May I ask… what you were just doing?”</p>, <p>Since I couldn’t ignore the same question thrice, I explained what I had done.</p>, <p>“There were still people alive. I saved them.”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>A mix of confusion and astonishment surfaced on her face.</p>, <p>“So… you used magic to…No, not that. People? Did you say there were living people there?”</p>, <p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>, <p>“And you saved them?”</p>, <p>“Yes.”</p>, <p>A new emotion flickered across her face, one that could roughly be described as hope.</p>, <p>“Who were they? A woman? Was it a woman?”</p>, <p>At the same time, she approached me with excessive excitement. Wait, that’s too close. Why is she acting like this?</p>, <p>“No, hold on. Could you step back a bit?”</p>, <p>“Oh… Yes.”</p>, <p>Following my request, she took a few steps back. But she was still restless.</p>, <p>“Excuse me…. Mage-nim?”</p>, <p>“No, I don’t know.”</p>, <p>It seemed like she would be happy if I said I had rescued a woman, but I didn’t know that much.</p>, <p>“…You don’t know?”</p>, <p>“Yes. The distance was too great, and there were obstructions. I could only tell if they were alive or dead.”</p>, <p>It would have been easier if it was the first basement level, but the person I sensed was in the second basement.</p>, <p>It was too far.</p>, <p>Moreover, the malevolent energy filling the basement greatly reduced the accuracy and effectiveness of my skills.</p>, <p>“But… what do you mean by you saved them?”</p>, <p>Distrust, doubt, anticipation, and confusion.</p>, <p>“I was able to reach out the place with my magical power. I pushed the ghouls away from the people and erected a barrier around them.”</p>, <p>“That sounds absurd… but I have no choice but to believe you.”</p>, <p>“Absurd you say?”</p>, <p>“Our organization’s magic advisor said that due to the malevolent energy and the influence of surreal entities in the basement, nothing could be confirmed without going down there in person. In reality, they couldn’t do anything.”</p>, <p>When she mentioned that the magic advisor was unable to do anything, Moon Seung-hee’s expression turned noticeably darker.</p>, <p>When I played the game, the position of Moon Seung-hee’s magic advisor was vacant.</p>, <p><em>It seems they were attacked by ghouls.</em></p>, <p>“Yet, the fact that you were able to confirm survivors or use magic without even entering… that’s astonishing.”</p>, <p>Although she said this, Moon Seung-hee’s expression still carried traces of distrust and doubt.</p>, <p>Well, it’s unreasonable to expect her to believe my words unconditionally. After all, we’ve only just met, and I haven’t shown any proof yet.</p>, <p>Whether Moon Seung-hee believes me or not, my magic is still active.</p>, <p>I was late in responding, so I could only save three people, but as long as my magic remains, they will stay alive.</p>, <p>After I explained the situation briefly, Moon Seung-hee seemed to ponder for a moment before continuing.</p>, <p>“How long can you maintain that magic?”</p>, <p>“I can sustain the magic as much as you want.”</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>Even though I was only speaking the truth, it seemed Moon Seung-hee’s distrust of me only deepened.</p>, <p>Additionally, there was a hint of skepticism. It seemed she was wondering to what extent she should believe the words of this “braggart”.</p>, <p>“Well, leaving that aside, the people’s magical power and life force are weak. They can’t hold on indefinitely. How long have the people been down there?”</p>, <p>“It’s been 24 hours since the ghouls were first discovered. And about 14 hours have passed since people entered to rescue those taken in the early stages of the incident.”</p>, <p>“Then it’s difficult to expect them to endure much longer.”</p>, <p>Moon Seung-hee’s expression became noticeably darker.</p>, <p>Whether she believes my words or not, the condition of the people underground remains dire.</p>, <p>There might be injured among them, and the environment is far from ideal.</p>, <p>While I can protect their bodies to some extent, I cannot safeguard their minds.</p>, <p>“You’ve done a great job as soon as you got here, and I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but can you get started on…. right away?”</p>, <p>“Of course.”</p>, <p>I said this and then pondered who Moon Seung-hee was doing this for.</p>, <p><em>Even in the game, several people were caught up in the ghoul infestation and died, and several were kidnapped.</em></p>, <p>I had always thought there was no way to save the kidnapped people, regardless of how early we intervened. I believed there was no route to rescue them.</p>, <p>But unexpectedly, the condition turned out to be something as bizarre as “You can only save them by using magic remotely before rushing inside”.</p>, <p><em>No, that’s not it, is it?</em></p>, <p>I realized that I had been thinking about something wrongly.</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>You can only save them by using magic remotely before rushing inside.</em></p>, <p>No, that wasn’t the only condition.</p>, <p>It was possible for me because I was a mage with these absurd stats, something inconceivable for ordinary first- or second-order mages.</p>, <p>At least a fourth-order mage.</p>, <p>Regardless of the approach, the level of magical proficiency required at this point was unreachable.</p>, <p>If one hadn’t started the game with exceptional stats like mine, the task would have been impossible.</p>, <p><em>Could this be straying from the pre-set routes of the game?</em></p>, <p>I had confirmed it before, but this world that was built on a bug-riddled game was excessively unstable.</p>, <p>What kind of butterfly effect could this action create?</p>, <p>I was worried, yet a part of me was…</p>, <p><em>A little… excited, right?</em></p>, <p>Here goes my gamer brain again…. the thought crossed my mind, but it couldn’t be helped.</p>, <p>It was at this time that Moon Seung-hee, who had been leading the way, stopped in her tracks.</p>, <p>“This way.”</p>, <p>The destination Moon Seung-hee led me to wasn’t far off.</p>, <p>It was a place that could be reached without special guidance and had a characteristic shape that could be recognized from afar.</p>, <p>Inside the partially constructed apartment complex.</p>, <p>Some parts were still unfinished, but the surrounding area looked pretty decent.</p>, <p>The nearby structures were already forming a complete apartment complex.</p>, <p>It appeared that the electrical installations were complete, as I could see lights on in a few places.</p>, <p>Moon Seung-hee pointed with her hand to a place that particularly stood out.</p>, <p>“Here’s the entrance to the underground parking lot.”</p>, <p>The entrance to the underground parking lot, right in the heart of the apartment complex, was a familiar sight that needed no further explanation.</p>, <p>Yet, the entrance to the underground parking lot before me would have been unrecognizable without Moon Seung-hee’s additional explanation…</p>, <p>This was due to the strange structure that had been built in front of it.</p>, <p>It was a large makeshift building, constructed from building materials, sandbags and what appeared to be specialized military equipment from an unknown source.</p>, <p>“…A defensive outpost, it seems.”</p>, <p>Around the defensive outpost, about a dozen armed soldiers watched the underground parking lot with tense expressions.</p>, <p>Most of them were dressed in suits, but they wore bulletproof vests over their suits and metal arm guards as additional protection.</p>, <p><em>And the level of their weapons is quite high.</em></p>, <p>Each soldier possessed strange-looking weapons that were uncommon in everyday life.</p>, <p>While most of them carried firearms, some had large hammers with bizarre engravings or melee weapons like swords.</p>, <p>It might sound amusing, but in [Cthulhu World], one should be more wary of those armed with melee weapons than those with guns.</p>, <p>In keeping with the unique logic of [Cthulhu World], those carrying melee weapons each possessed extraordinary magical powers.</p>, <p><em>Mercenaries….? No, all the people appearing here were employees.</em></p>, <p>It might sound absurd, but even the Republic of Korea in [Cthulhu World] and even Paju in [Cthulhu World] were like that.</p>, <p>Although the use of firearms and force was illegal even in [Cthulhu World], one wouldn’t be arrested unless they brandished weapons openly in front of the police.</p>, <p>These individuals were likely members of the security team within Yeonam Construction.</p>, <p>As I was observing the defense posts and security personnel, Moon Seung-hee spoke up.</p>, <p>“Officially, it’s a temporary installation.”</p>, <p>“I see.”</p>, <p>The name didn’t really matter, but perhaps due to legal or other issues, Moon Seung-hee insisted on the vague term “temporary installation”.</p>, <p>“There are five other installations like this one, set up to prevent the escape of ghouls.”</p>, <p>I responded to Seunghee Moon’s words by nodding my head without offering any particular opinion.</p>, <p>As we approached the defense post a bit more, a large man who stood out among the troops approached us.</p>, <p>He was such a fearsome-looking man that you’d think he was already committing a minor offense just by standing there empty-handed.</p>, <p>He even held a giant hammer in one hand, its handle as long as he was tall.</p>, <p>“Director, you have arrived?”</p>, <p>“Yes. What’s the current situation?”</p>, <p>“The preparations are complete without any issues. We can proceed as soon as the requested support firepower arrives. But… who is this?”</p>, <p>Anxiety flickered across his rugged face.</p>, <p>His expression made it blatantly obvious what he was thinking. He had been expecting a renowned mage, and here was this skinny kid instead.</p>, <p>His reaction was honest, if not a bit rude.</p>, <p>With his large face and prominent eyes, he blinked at Moon Seung-hee.</p>, <p>“Is this…?”</p>, <p>His expression seemed to question, “Surely not, right?” But Moon Seung-hee simply responded.</p>, <p>“This person is the mage who came to assist today.”</p>, <p>“…Really?”</p>, <p>The man paused, thought for a moment, then scratched his head and muttered to himself.</p>, <p>“Haah… crazy, what’s with that mask…ugh… never mind.”</p>, <p>His mumble was just a whisper and it probably went unheard by Moon Seung-hee standing next to him, but my heightened senses thanks to [Enhanced Vigilance] caught every word.</p>, <p>“……..”</p>, <p>“Alright. Mage-nim? My name is Kwak Dae-yong. I’m the team leader of the Yeonam Construction security team… and currently in charge of this site.”</p>, <p>“I’m Kim Shin-hwa.”</p>, <p>“Anyway, I assume you’re not here for a small fee, so please do your best. You understand?”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong’s words trailed off almost to a murmur, sounding like a faint “Please, you understand right?”.</p>, <p>“Sure.”</p>, <p>Just as the introductions were concluding, Moon Seung-hee couldn’t hold back and interjected.</p>, <p>“Team Leader, we’re running out of time.”</p>, <p>“Yes, I’m aware.”</p>, <p>“No, that’s not what I mean. There are still people alive underground.”</p>, <p>“What do you mean…? Survivors?”</p>, <p>“Yes, the mage here confirmed it. There are still people alive…”</p>, <p>While saying that, Moon Seung-hee turned to look at me.</p>, <p>“Yes, there are three survivors.”</p>, <p>“Survivors… three of them… Alright, understood.”</p>, <p>Although Kwak Dae-yong tried his best to manage his expression, given that Moon Seung-hee was right beside him, it seemed to be a difficult task.</p>, <p>He perfectly assumed the look of “a subordinate trying to appease a boss who’s been duped by a fraud mage”.</p>, <p>“We were planning to do just a minimal briefing before proceeding anyway… Don’t worry. Come this way, please.”</p>, <p>He said this and led us to a space set up on one side of the defense post.</p>, <p>“We’re in an urgent situation, so we’ll skip formalities and procedures.”</p>, <p>The place resembled a kind of makeshift command center, but the defense post itself was temporary, so it wasn’t a properly equipped location.</p>, <p>It was merely a simple table laid out on the bare ground with a few architectural blueprints spread out.</p>, <p>“Currently, we estimate there are about 20 to 30 ghouls. Are you familiar with the physiology of ghouls? They move through tunnels…”</p>, <p>“I know.”</p>, <p>“Hmm, that’s good. These creatures, like moles, must have sprung up from somewhere or been set loose. There’s likely a hole somewhere in the underground parking lot where they entered.”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong then pointed out a few places on the architectural blueprints.</p>, <p>“The expected areas are here, here, and here… If there’s any commotion, more could emerge from those tunnels. We could be dealing with twice as many as are currently underground.”</p>, <p>When he said this, Kwak Dae-yong glanced briefly at Moon Seung-hee.</p>, <p>Moon Seung-hee’s expression remained unchanged, but upon closer inspection, her fingers and the ends of her eyebrows were twitching slightly.</p>, <p><em>Rush in now!</em> It looks like she is holding back on saying something along these lines.</p>, <p>At any given time, in whatever manner we met, Kwak Dae-yong always picked a quarrel with me.</p>, <p>Thus, his unwarranted actions were nothing new to me, but Moon Seung-hee’s involvement was unexpected.</p>, <p><em>It seems that rescuing someone trapped underground could greatly advance my relationship with her.</em></p>, <p>Eventually, under the silent pressure exerted by Moon Seung-hee, Kwak Dae-yong concluded his explanation at a reasonable point.</p>, <p>“We’ve blocked all other entry points, so applying pressure won’t cause major issues. We’ve decided that a straightforward plan with overwhelming firepower is the best approach, rather than a complex one.”</p>, <p>“So, that’s why I’m here.”</p>, <p>They had hired a mage to increase their lacking firepower.</p>, <p>“That’s right. However, there is one aspect I’d like you to be mindful of.”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong spoke gravely and softly.</p>, <p>“What is it?”</p>, <p>“Well…. this place is not a battlefield, but a newly built apartment complex that cost a considerable amount of money. Could you use methods that won’t leave much of a trace?”</p>, <p>If it were just about firepower, there are many alternatives that don’t require an expensive mage.</p>, <p>But the ability to unleash powerful force without leaving any trace, as if nothing had happened, is a feat only a mage can accomplish.</p>, <p>“Well, that’s possible.”</p>, <p>“That’s a relief. As you know, this isn’t just a minor issue of cockroaches emerging, is it?”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong paused briefly before continuing with emphasis.</p>, <p>“We cannot leave any remnants. If the creatures hide in the tunnels, we must pursue them and eradicate them completely.”</p>, <p>His point was valid.</p>, <p>No one would want to live in an apartment built over tunnels frequented by man-eating ghouls.</p>, <p>“So, teams B and C will move from here to there, while team A which includes the mage and myself will make a frontal assault here, directly entering down to the second basement level. Do you understand the plan?”</p>, <p>I understood the plan.</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong explained it at length, even drawing diagrams, but the content was simple.</p>, <p>Teams B and C were tasked with preventing the ghouls from dispersing.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, team A which comprised of Kwak Dae-yong and myself, would move in and beat down the ghouls.</p>, <p>Use plenty of magic for an easier breach. That was it.</p>, <p>I understood the plan, but there was a critical flaw in Kwak Dae-yong’s strategy from the start.</p>, <p>“Hmm… I understand the plan.”</p>, <p>My vague response seemed to irk Kwak Dae-yong who showed a flicker of annoyance.</p>, <p>“…If you have any other opinions or suggestions, please speak up now.”</p>, <p>“The plan is flawed.”</p>, <p>“What did you say?”</p>, <p>He estimated the number of ghouls to be around sixty at most.</p>, <p>Likely, the troops prepared would be sufficient to counter such a number.</p>, <p>But then…</p>, <p>[The number of life forms matching the conditions is 125.]</p>, <p>Excluding the three human survivors from this…</p>, <p>“The number of ghouls. Right now, there are 122 ghouls gathered underground.”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong’s mouth fell open in astonishment.</p>, <p>“Is that… accurate information?”</p>, <p>“Hmm… If you include those in the tunnels, there might even be more…”</p>, <p>“Ha!”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong cut me off with a sound that was neither laughter nor exclamation.</p>, <p>“That’s ridiculous! Your earlier mention of survivors too… On what grounds and belief do you make such statements?”</p>, <p>See, this is why I didn’t want to talk about it.</p>, <p>As expected, he didn’t believe the part about the survivors.</p>, <p>When I played this as a game, I would just skip such scenes and end it by selecting a few predetermined choices… But here, these people are alive, and they react vividly to my words and actions.</p>, <p>Responding to each reaction turned out to be more bothersome than I had anticipated.</p>, <p><em>I guess it’s better to show them rather than continue this verbal sparring.</em></p>, <p>“Well, if you can’t believe it, there’s nothing I can do. We’ll proceed as you originally planned.”</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong wore a skeptical expression but soon rose from his seat.</p>, <p>“Then let’s get ready immediately. Just make sure you don’t impede our progress with any erratic actions.”</p>, <p>“Well, I’ll definitely deliver the value of the payment you’ve made.”</p>, <p>I assured him with certainty that it was worth the fifty million won, but Kwak Dae-yong’s face bore an incredulous look. Or was he glaring at me?</p>, <p>Eventually, he grumbled and walked towards his subordinates.</p>, <p>He then loudly announced that the operation would commence soon and began organizing the troops.</p>, <p>Moon Seung-hee watched Kwak Dae-yong’s command for a moment and then turned to me.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Moon Seung-hee slowly continued speaking.</p>, <p>“If Mage-nim’s words are true, do you think that the personnel here are sufficient?”</p>, <p>“Um…”</p>, <p>“If you need more support…”</p>, <p>I paused for a moment. Was more support necessary?</p>, <p>No, it wasn’t needed.</p>, <p>If the enemies were merely ghouls, I could handle them alone, even if there were two hundred instead of a hundred.</p>, <p>More people would only add to the confusion and increase the trouble.

Moon Seung-hee didn’t mention it and stood up.</p>, <p>“Then, I hope you handle it well.”</p>, <p>“I’ll do my best.”</p>, <p>Moon Seung-hee briefly bowed her head and slowly walked out of the temporary defensive outpost.</p>, <p>“Preparation complete!”</p>, <p>Her departure coincided with the chorus of voices announcing readiness.</p>, <p>It seemed that Kwak Dae-yong and his men had finished their preparations.</p>, <p><em>So much for keeping the operation a secret.</em></p>, <p>Talking so loudly in the dead of night…</p>, <p>But it probably didn’t matter.</p>, <p>One shouldn’t think of this place as a typical apartment complex in another city.</p>, <p>I didn’t know what this area would become when the complex was completed, but at the moment there was nothing around it.</p>, <p>Besides, no one in Paju would care about strange noises around the dangerous and unstable Imjin River area.</p>, <p>There was nothing to gain from further irritating Kwak Dae-yong…. so I got up and walked over to where he was.</p>, <p>The spot where Kwak Dae-yong and his men gathered was the innermost part of the temporary outpost.</p>, <p>A large spiral ramp designed for vehicles to descend into the underground parking lot.</p>, <p>There, you could see a huge barricade blocking the entrance.</p>, <p>An improvised barbed wire fence with multiple layers of crude steel plates reinforced on top of it.</p>, <p><em>They’ve managed to set up a barricade quite well.</em></p>, <p>Honestly, it looked more like a ragged patchwork thrown together as a last resort than an impressive defensive wall.</p>, <p>Bloodstains and pieces of flesh dripped down the barricade, along with what seemed to be fragments of ghoul fingers.</p>, <p>Sacrifices must have been made to hold back the onslaught of ghouls.</p>, <p>And there were the people gathered in front of the barricade.</p>, <p>Including Kwak Dae-yong, there were a total of twenty.</p>, <p>Most of them were extras, and their expressions were somewhat gloomy, but there were a few faces that stood out in my memory.</p>, <p>The sight of people in neat suits, donned with armor and weapons, standing in rows was indeed quite strange.</p>, <p>However, the way they looked at me was filled with distrust, much like Kwak Dae-yong’s initial reaction.</p>, <p>They whispered among themselves as their eyes shifted between Kwak Dae-yong and me, but due to my exceptionally sensitive perception, I could hear their voices even from a considerable distance.</p>, <p>“What’s with the mask?”</p>, <p>“Hey, is that bastard alright?”</p>, <p>“Where did they pick up such a freak?”</p>, <p>“He looks so flimsy…”</p>, <p>“Are we being deceived?”</p>, <p>Tch… What does being a mage have to do with looking flimsy?</p>, <p>Although I had enhanced several stats with artifacts, my physical condition hadn’t changed much, so I apparently didn’t seem trustworthy to those hired for their physical strength.</p>, <p>“Attention! The mage has arrived!”</p>, <p>Regardless, as soon as I arrived, Kwak Dae-yong shouted again and made his troops snap to attention.</p>, <p>“To your positions!”</p>, <p>“To positions!”</p>, <p>The men moved in unison and they started heading towards the barricaded entrance of the underground parking lot.</p>, <p>I had been a bit worried seeing them idly gossiping, but when it was time to act, they were impressively coordinated and disciplined.</p>, <p>Once the preparations were complete, Kwak Dae-yong approached me and said,</p>, <p>“Please get your magic ready. As soon as you give us the signal, we’ll open the barricade for you.”</p>, <p>“Just open it now.”</p>, <p>“Yes, then… What?”</p>, <p>“I said open it now; I’m ready.”</p>, <p><em>Is he joking with me?</em></p>, <p><em>It seems like he still hadn’t done anything though.</em></p>, <p><em>Is he perhaps confused? What a man.</em></p>, <p>Despite the atmosphere thick with unspoken words wriggling beneath his throat, Kwak Dae-yong managed to hold them back. Admirable, Kwak Dae-yong!</p>, <p>He turned his head in an exaggerated motion and yelled at his subordinates,</p>, <p>“Hey, open the barricade! Door open!”</p>, <p>“Door open!”</p>, <p>“Door open!”</p>, <p>At Kwak Dae-yong’s command, his subordinates near the barricade quickly echoed and opened the barricade.</p>, <p><em>Gigigigigigigi-</em></p>, <p>With a grating, discordant metallic noise, the double and triple-reinforced barricade swung open.</p>, <p>Alright, is this where it begins?</p>, <p>I was a cut above the average mages that Kwak Dae-yong had seen before.</p>, <p>[Quick Activation]</p>, <p>[Catalyst Compensation]</p>, <p>[Double Incantation]</p>, <p>[Casting Omission]</p>, <p>All spells could be activated immediately without any separate casting, hand signs, catalysts, or incantations.</p>, <p>The mana that flowed out formed a consistent magic circle that followed my command.</p>, <p>It was a massive magic circle, etched with runes of blazing flames.</p>, <p>[The unique feature of the S-rank accessory ‘Ring of Corrupted Flame’ has been activated. ‘Red Element Concentration’ and ‘Legacy of Fire Knowledge’ are triggered.</p>, <p>// Red Element Concentration: Increases the effectiveness of all fire-type spells by 50%.</p>, <p>// Legacy of Fire Knowledge: Enhances understanding of ‘fire-type magic’.]</p>, <p>The barricade opened.</p>, <p>Strange sounds echoed from the underground parking lot.</p>, <p><em>– Chirrrrrrrrrr!!!</em></p>, <p><em>– Kyahahahahaha!!!</em></p>, <p>Bizarre creatures sprang from the darkness.</p>, <p>“Over there, that way!”</p>, <p>As the security team members turned their heads, the lights mounted on their shoulders converged into a single point.</p>, <p>Monsters that resembled humans yet were unmistakably not human.</p>, <p>Bizarre heads resembling dogs.</p>, <p>A viciously twisted muscular body.</p>, <p>And developed deadly sharp claws.</p>, <p>Ghouls.</p>, <p><em>– Screeeeech!!</em></p>, <p>There were four of them.</p>, <p>No, six, nine, and then two more followed, making eleven!</p>, <p>Ghouls that had been hiding in the darkness around the entrance suddenly poured out.</p>, <p>[Before your eyes, a bizarre shape…]</p>, <p>I already know, so get out of my way!</p>, <p>I ignored the message window that appeared in front of me and completed the spell.</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p><em>Whoooosh!!</em></p>, <p>A giant ball of flame materialized in front of my outstretched hands and was aimed at the emerging ghouls.</p>, <p>[…That horrific shape and nauseating stench assault your senses…]</p>, <p>Skip the chatter; fire the flames!</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!!!</em></p>, <p>The massive fireball I shot from my hands blazed through the air.</p>, <p><em>Boom!!!</em></p>, <p><em>– Screeeeeeech!!!</em></p>, <p>The ones who could scream were the lucky ones.

The ghoul’s fear-inducing effect has been nullified.]</p>, <p>Ah, did I fail the sanity check?</p>, <p>But thanks to the trait of Madness of the Abyss, neither madness manifested nor was there a calamity of being overcome with fear.</p>, <p>At the same time, I twisted my outstretched hands forward.</p>, <p><em>He said that I shouldn’t cause damage around me, right?</em></p>, <p>[Flame Manipulation]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Whooooosh!!!</em></p>, <p>I forcefully grasped and twisted the fiercely burning flames spreading in all directions.</p>, <p>It was a dazzling spectacle.</p>, <p>The surging flames transformed into a terrifying whirlwind of fire that continuously converged inward.</p>, <p><em>Whirrrrrrrrr!!!</em></p>, <p>The darkness and shadows scattered around were completely obliterated.</p>, <p>Before our eyes, a huge flame was dancing. It was burning so intensely that it seemed to scorch our pupils.</p>, <p>“Oh, my goodness!”</p>, <p>The troops waiting in the wings let out a unanimous exclamation upon seeing the flames I had created.</p>, <p>[The people around you are inspired by your heroic actions. Temporary exemption from sanity judgments for those around you.]</p>, <p>But this was just the beginning.</p>, <p><em>Whirrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!</em></p>, <p>The huge flame burning with my magical power turned into a wave of fire and poured down into the underground parking lot.</p>, <p>Now, speed was of the essence.</p>, <p>“You, you…”</p>, <p>But in the midst of all this, Dae-yong Kwak was just looking at me with his mouth wide open.</p>, <p>“Team leader, what are you doing?”</p>, <p>“What… what?”</p>, <p>“Aren’t we going to charge in?”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong, who had been standing dumbfounded as if boasting the size of his open mouth finally snapped back to reality.</p>, <p>“Uh, right. What are we waiting for, everyone! Charge!”</p>, <p>“Charge!”</p>, <p>They were neither military soldiers, mercenaries, nor fixers, but simply regular employees of a large corporation and they were now rushing forward, armed with guns and swords.</p>, <p>The task at hand was clear.</p>, <p>Eliminate all visible ghouls and rescue the survivors trapped underground.</p>, <p>“Let’s go!”</p>, <p>The underground parking lot, still devoid of electrical installations, was extremely dark.</p>, <p>Although the security team members had some lights attached to their shoulders and weapons, these were insufficient to completely erase the darkness and fear that enveloped the vast parking area.</p>, <p>Therefore, I intentionally conjured spells accompanied by bright light.</p>, <p><em>I’d better choose something with good duration.</em></p>, <p>[Orb of Radiance]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>Seven orbs of light were created from my fingertips.</p>, <p><em>Swooooosh…</em></p>, <p>The clusters of light spread out in all directions, tracing large circles as they rotated and illuminated the interior of the underground parking lot.</p>, <p><em>– Screeeeeeech!</em></p>, <p>“There, fire at that spot!”</p>, <p><em>Ratatatatatatatatata!!!</em></p>, <p>Ghouls fell under the barrage of gunfire raining down from a distance. Since there was a condition to avoid damaging the scene as much as possible, the security team’s shooting was cautious. As a result, some ghouls managed to break through the barrage and get close.</p>, <p><em>– Gyaaaaaaa!!</em></p>, <p>But even those ghouls…</p>, <p><em>Bang! Crunch! Boom!</em></p>, <p>It was Kwak Dae-yong.</p>, <p>When he swung his hammer imbued with magical power, the bodies of the ghouls caught in his attack shattered as if they had no bones.</p>, <p>“Yeehaw!”</p>, <p><em>Crunch, bang, bang! Boom!</em></p>, <p>But even without Kwak Dae-yong, the melee specialists swept through the area and skilfully eliminated the ghouls</p>, <p>I couldn’t just stand by idly.</p>, <p>[Brilliance of Fomalhaut]</p>, <p>Fomalhaut is the abode of the god of fire, a dwelling place for the [Living Flame], which is a blazing supernova itself.</p>, <p>I summoned his authority to this damp and dark underground parking lot.</p>, <p>Well, even so, this type of magic ultimately just results in an outpouring of extremely hot fire.

Team A will break through the center and head straight down to the second basement level.”</p>, <p>“What kind of parking lot is this fu*king big?”</p>, <p>I could hear a member of the security team grumbling.</p>, <p>The area was indeed huge.</p>, <p>“Didn’t you know? The apartments of the wealthy are always like this, with even two basement levels.”</p>, <p><em>Aren’t these people being too careless right now?</em></p>, <p>It was clear they were veterans qualified to be employed by major corporations, but their level of complacency was excessive. And Kwak Dae-yong…</p>, <p>“Advance, advance! Don’t fall behind!”</p>, <p><em>Bang! Crash!

            "[<p>Twenty-eight minutes or rather now twenty-nine minutes had passed since the ghoul eradication operation began in the underground parking lot.</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong, the team leader of Yeonam Construction’s security team, thought to himself.</p>, <p><em>Something is wrong.</em></p>, <p>There were far too many ghouls.</p>, <p>This couldn’t be happening!</p>, <p>It was inconceivable.</p>, <p>In the beginning, Kwak Dae-yong had estimated about thirty ghouls.</p>, <p>He had even stretched his estimate to a maximum of around sixty, but even that was a very conservative calculation.</p>, <p>Therefore, it was supposed to be a mission that Kwak Dae-yong’s team alone could sufficiently handle.</p>, <p>The suggestion to hire a mage from outside was solely Moon Seung-hee’s idea.</p>, <p>For the sake of the operation’s swiftness and precision, to minimize damage, and to prepare for any unforeseen circumstances.</p>, <p><em>– Gyahhaaaaaaaa!!!</em></p>, <p>A ghoul emerged from the darkness and attacked Kwak Dae-yong with its swinging vicious claws.</p>, <p>“Get lost!”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong swung the battle hammer he held in both hands with lightning speed.</p>, <p><em>Baaaaang!!!</em></p>, <p>The ghoul’s head struck by the hammer that was infused with magical power shattered instantly, and the floor of the underground parking lot was stained bright red with blood spurting from the ghoul’s head.</p>, <p>“Huff… Huff…”</p>, <p><em>It’s my limit now… There are too many ghouls!</em></p>, <p>Before he knew it, he had knocked down all the ghouls that had been charging at him.</p>, <p>Even though it was a brief moment of rest, Kwak Dae-yong couldn’t find proper peace or even relax his guard.</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong blinked his large eyes and started scanning his surroundings.</p>, <p>His gaze was anxious, his breathing unstable, his complexion pale, and his stance tensely poised for attack.</p>, <p>Over-the-top violence and exaggerated speech.</p>, <p>Signs of fear, madness, and confusion were becoming apparent on him.</p>, <p>“Where the hell is this…?”</p>, <p><em>Was this parking lot always this vast?</em></p>, <p>The surroundings were dark, wide, and openly spacious in every direction.</p>, <p>He could only see the repetitive large gray columns made of concrete.</p>, <p>The finishing work was still not done. There was no paint or sign to indicate anything.</p>, <p>The same scenery kept appearing in the deep darkness.</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong, who was in a state of confusion, felt as if he was trapped in this endless space.</p>, <p>“What the fu*k is going on…”</p>, <p>At that moment, a strange name popped into his head.</p>, <p><em>Kim Shin-hwa. That rookie mage…</em></p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa’s voice echoed in his head.</p>, <p>He initially thought that the guy was either crazy or that he was empty bragging to inflate his own worth.</p>, <p>But his words turned out to be true.</p>, <p>Indeed, more than a hundred ghouls were swarming in this underground parking lot.</p>, <p>“Fu*k it… Fu*k it all…”</p>, <p>After a moment of restless agitation, Kwak Dae-yong shouted in a vague direction.</p>, <p>He couldn’t help but scream; it was unbearable to remain silent.</p>, <p>“Everyone! Where are you! Gather here! Yeom Cheol-min! Hyung-gu! Choi Mi-na!”</p>, <p>It was already too late.</p>, <p>An abnormal darkness lay in all directions, and his subordinates were nowhere to be seen.</p>, <p>The moment he entered the second basement level, he started hearing a strange bell sound.</p>, <p><em>Ding.</em></p>, <p><em>Yes, that sound.</em></p>, <p>Everything started to go wrong right after he heard that sound.</p>, <p><em>Ding.</em></p>, <p><em>Come to think of it, why did I rashly dash down to the second basement level?

(Ding) And as the world darkens, I’m engulfed in an unpleasant, maddening rage, and at some point, I lost all my men. Where am I exactly?

You monsters!</em></p>, <p><em>Bang! Crash! Bang! Crack!

Thump, crack!!</em></p>, <p>The ghoul he had been pounding had long since become a shapeless mass of flesh, pulverized beyond recognition, but Kwak Dae-yong did not stop hammering.</p>, <p>“Heh heh… Fu*k it… Damn it… Die! Fu*k you, die!”</p>, <p><em>Crack, crasssssh!</em></p>, <p>Eventually, he lost direction and ended up striking the empty floor.</p>, <p>“Cough, damn it… Heh heh, heh heh… Fu*k it, hahaha…”</p>, <p>His hands trembled from the shock.</p>, <p>The hammer, loaded with excessive force, rage, and madness, had shattered the floor, which was smeared with disgusting mucus and blood.</p>, <p>When he lifted the hammer slightly, he saw that the floor was crushed, leaving a hole the size of two human heads.</p>, <p>“Shit…”</p>, <p>His hand felt numb from the unnecessary flailing. He paused for a moment and endured the sharp pain in his hands.</p>, <p><em>Ding.</em></p>, <p>“Shit… not the bell sound again!”</p>, <p>He had forgotten that every time he heard the bell sound, in his excessive excitement and anger, ghouls always rushed towards him.</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong momentarily looked in the direction where the bell sounded and cursed.</p>, <p>And he immediately paid the price for his complacent actions.</p>, <p><em>– Screeeeech!!!</em></p>, <p>A new ghoul rushed out from a completely blind spot.</p>, <p>“Damn it—!”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong spat out a curse and tried to retrieve his hammer, but he was a beat too late.</p>, <p>There was no other choice.</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong accepted the risk of further injury to his side and channeled his magical power into his fist before swinging…</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Toxicity]</p>, <p><em>Boom, crash, Baaang!

Gyaaaaaaagh!!</em></p>, <p>Horrible and repulsive holes began to form all over the ghoul’s body.</p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa’s magic was incredibly accurate and astonishingly powerful.</p>, <p><em>But… What is this horrific spell? This rookie mage infused his spell with some kind of malevolent poison!</em></p>, <p>“Ugh…!”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong clutched his mouth to suppress the rising nausea and urge to vomit.</p>, <p>His head was spinning. He felt as if he might go insane at any moment.</p>, <p>He had heard that many mages were sociopaths or psychopaths, but he had never encountered one like this.</p>, <p><em>Rrrrrrrrrrrr—</em></p>, <p>He started hearing the sound of rolling wheels.</p>, <p>What was that noise? Kwak Dae-yong looked momentarily puzzled, but quickly raised his hammer as he realized the sound was approaching him.</p>, <p>And then, emerging from the darkness…</p>, <p>A hideous mask with four eyes.</p>, <p>If not for the magical light and the intense glow of its eyes, he would have failed to recognize the figure in the pitch-black darkness.</p>, <p>It was a mage wearing a bizarre mask.</p>, <p>It was Kim Shin-hwa.</p>, <p>Only when he came fully into view did Kwak Dae-yong identify the strange source of the wheel sound.</p>, <p>“Huh… You were riding that?”</p>, <p>A skateboard.</p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa was riding a large skateboard.</p>, <p>“I didn’t think I’d need to use it today, but I had to because team leader went too far ahead. It took me a while to find you.”</p>, <p>“Thanks… I owe you my life. And I’m sorry for the disgraceful scene.”</p>, <p>After receiving Kwak Dae-yong’s sincere gratitude and apology, Kim Shin-hwa scratched his mask for a moment and appeared to be contemplating what to say.</p>, <p>“Hmm… I’m glad you managed to break free from the madness on your own. Otherwise, I was wondering if I should beat some sense into you.”</p>, <p>To Kim Shin-hwa, the most straightforward way to awaken someone engulfed in madness was through attacking him. That had always been his belief.</p>, <p>“Uhm…”</p>, <p>Although Kwak Dae-yong felt a mild anger towards Kim Shin-hwa’s ruthless attitude, he wasn’t in a position to openly express his anger. After all, this man had saved his life.</p>, <p>Moreover, Kwak Dae-yong realized the desperate need for Kim Shin-hwa’s help, not just for himself but also to ensure the safety of his subordinates.</p>, <p>“What about the others… my men?”</p>, <p>“That’s a good point you raised. I’m currently busy. I can’t keep attending to you alone.”</p>, <p>After saying this, Kim Shin-hwa activated a spell in a certain direction.</p>, <p>[Aiming Correction]</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p><em>Whooooosh-Boom!</em></p>, <p><em>– Screeeeech!</em></p>, <p>Even as Kim Shin-hwa engaged in conversation and observed Kwak Dae-yong’s complexion, his senses were extended throughout the entire underground parking lot.</p>, <p>Understanding the situation, Kwak Dae-yong picked up his battle hammer and said,</p>, <p>“Now that I’m back to my senses… go save the others!”</p>, <p>“Understood. I’ll guide them to gather nearby. Don’t stray too far away from me.”</p>, <p>“Got it.”</p>, <p><em>Rrrrrrrrrrr—</em></p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa stomped his feet on the ground a few times. Then he disappeared in a way that even Kwak Dae-yong found absurd.</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p><em>Boom!!</em></p>, <p>He triggered a fireball beneath his skateboard that was protected with a spell from the impact, catapulting himself into the air with the explosion’s force. This was a technique Kim Shin-hwa self-titled “Explosive Leap”.</p>, <p>He made use of the explosion’s very force to move at an explosive speed while casting spells.</p>, <p>[Chains of Domination]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Range Increase]</p>, <p><em>Swishhhhhhhhhhh!!!</em></p>, <p>Golden chains sprang from Kim Shin-hwa’s palms, shooting out like snakes with a will of their own in every direction.</p>, <p>They coiled around their targets, stripping away their freedom, and…</p>, <p>Magical chains that could force desired actions were wrapped around several ghouls.</p>, <p><em>– Screeeeech!!!</em></p>, <p>Once they were wrapped with the Chains of Domination, the ghouls moved in bizarre ways like marionettes controlled by a puppeteer’s will before they started attacking their own kind.</p>, <p>With fists, claws, feet, heads, and teeth.</p>, <p>The ghouls that were too damaged to be of any further use were forced to perform bizarre movements that no normal living being could handle.</p>, <p><em>Grgrgrgrgrg!!!</em></p>, <p><em>Crack, snap, crunch! Crack-snap-crunch!!</em></p>, <p>The bodies of the ghouls, forced into movements beyond their joints’ limits, emitted horrific tearing sounds as they were ripped apart.</p>, <p>Each time Kim Shin-hwa cast a new spell, ghouls lurking in the darkness were destroyed in truly gruesome ways.</p>, <p>“Is that really a human?”</p>, <p>This was not said by Kwak Dae-yong.</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong hurriedly turned in the direction of the sound.</p>, <p>It was one of his subordinates from the security team.</p>, <p>A veteran agent and a former fixer who had worked with Kwak Dae-yong several times with efficient coordination.</p>, <p>Yet currently, he let his weapon hang loosely at his feet as he stared into the darkness with a dazed expression on his face.</p>, <p>Forgetting his own mission and the crisis at hand, he simply stared at Kim Shin-hwa’s movements.</p>, <p>“What are you doing, dumba**!

It was a spell of a different level.</p>, <p>An arrogant and unpleasant ritual, a technique that only humans can handle.</p>, <p>[Quest information has been updated.</p>, <p>The number of targets to be eliminated has changed from 122 to 167.]</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>Suddenly the number of ghouls increased.</p>, <p>Though there had been ominous signs, this situation was unexpected.</p>, <p><em>It’s not a problem that can be solved simply by eliminating a large number of ghouls.</em></p>, <p>If, as Kwak Dae-yong said, the tunnels were interconnected, such a sudden increase would be impossible.</p>, <p>My magical power detection range envelops the entire underground parking lot. There is no tunnel beyond my detection range.</p>, <p>Then…</p>, <p><em>It must be summoning magic.</em></p>, <p>The human mage I had sensed earlier. Somewhere in the underground parking lot, there was a mage summoning ghouls.</p>, <p>That they were moving so openly suggested they might soon start to exercise abilities beyond summoning.</p>, <p>Just as my thoughts reached this point, a new problem arose.</p>, <p>The malevolent energy that had been fluctuating wildly suddenly surged in one direction, and at the same moment, a terrible scream erupted from the depths of the parking lot’s darkness.</p>, <p>“Arghhh! My hand! My hand!!”</p>, <p>It wasn’t the scream of a ghoul. The source was quite far, but…</p>, <p>[Remote Detection]</p>, <p>I activated a remote detection spell with reflex-like speed.</p>, <p>Beyond the considerable distance and the darkness that filled it, I could discern the situation at the problem’s location.</p>, <p>A man in a suit and armor with a sword dropped to the ground.</p>, <p>One of Kwak Dae-yong’s subordinates, the one who wielded a sleek single-edged sword.</p>, <p>I never had the chance to call out to him, but I already knew his name.</p>, <p><em>Was it Yeom Cheol-min?</em></p>, <p>With a bit more thought, I could recall his specific stats and a full illustration, but that wasn’t necessary. Among Kwak Dae-yong’s subordinates, he was a named NPC with fairly high stats.</p>, <p>One of his arms was blackened and rotting away.</p>, <p>From his fingertips, black tumors blossomed, and the yellowish pus that spewed from them further decayed his flesh.</p>, <p>A magical poison was rapidly corroding his arm.</p>, <p>“Ah, shit. Why did it have to be that?”</p>, <p>The effect was weak, but it was a spell with the same effect as the toxic spell I had used.</p>, <p>Later, if things went wrong, it might be treated as a death caused by my mistake.</p>, <p>“Cheol-min-aaaah!”</p>, <p>This was Kwak Dae-yong’s shout. I could feel Kwak Dae-yong and his men moving towards Yeom Cheol-min.</p>, <p>Why is that guy suddenly acting up?</p>, <p>It would be better to arrive before Kwak Dae-yong and sort out the situation.</p>, <p><em>Rrrrrr—</em></p>, <p>I rolled on the ground, changing the direction of the skateboard, and activated a spell.</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>[Impact]</p>, <p>The magic circle embedded underneath the board activated, performing a skateboard trick only possible by a mage of [Cthulhu World]… an explosive acceleration.</p>, <p><em>Kwaang!!</em></p>, <p><em>Shhhhh</em></p>, <p>It felt like every joint in my body was breaking due to the abnormal acceleration that relied on explosive power, but I quickly reached near Yeom Cheol-min.</p>, <p>[Human Body Scanning]</p>, <p>[Remote Detection]</p>, <p>[Magic Detection]</p>, <p>[Invisibility Detection]</p>, <p>[Curse Detection]</p>, <p>[Trap Detection]</p>, <p>At the same time, I extended invisible lines of magical power in all directions, analyzing and observing his wounds, the situation, potential dangers, solutions, unexpected variables, traps, and curses.</p>, <p>Ah, this wound is beyond repair.</p>, <p>“Sorry, Cheol-min-ssi!”</p>, <p>[Blade of Wind]</p>, <p><em>Swoosh-.</em></p>, <p>A sharply honed blade of wind flew and sliced off Yeom Cheol-min’s forearm.</p>, <p>“Ahh!”</p>, <p>He must have been startled, but it was an extremely focused blade. He probably didn’t even feel the pain or realize he was cut.</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>[Enhancement]</p>, <p>[Courage of the Lion]</p>, <p>I quickly hardened Yeom Cheol-min’s wound to stop the bleeding and cast several enchantments on his mind to calm him down.</p>, <p>And the Blade of Wind that had cut off Yeom Cheol-min’s arm and continued on…</p>, <p>It went on and sliced through the corpse of a ghoul lying on the ground.</p>, <p><em>Puk!</em></p>, <p>“Guh!”</p>, <p>Look at this. A ghoul, already dead, screaming?</p>, <p>The initiative ensures victory.

Surprisingly, the ghoul that was clearly dead before began to move and opened its mouth.</p>, <p>What it said was…</p>, <p>“Yo-you little…!!!”</p>, <p>Ah, no need to listen to that.</p>, <p>I decided that there was no need to listen to the ghoul anymore; instead, I shouted at Kwak Dae-yong.</p>, <p>“Team Leader Kwak Dae-yong, look at that! Wow! The ghoul corpse is talking! [Fireball]!”</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong who didn’t understand the situation let out a bewildered sound.</p>, <p>“Uh, what?!”</p>, <p>Whether Kwak Dae-yong understood the situation or not, the giant fireballs I had created in my hands flew straight at the ghoul.</p>, <p><em>Shiiiiiiik!!!</em></p>, <p><em>Kwaang!!!!</em></p>, <p>Oops, I forgot to control the fire… The walls got a bit scorched and the floor cracked, but that’s not the problem right now.</p>, <p>The body of the ghoul hit by the fireballs was shattered and scattered in all directions.</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong came in late and then spoke to me with a dazed look on his face.</p>, <p>“What in the world? What was that?”</p>, <p>“Looks like a strange guy, or rather it seems a mage was involved?”</p>, <p>“A mage?!”</p>, <p>Yeom Cheol-min, staggered and holding his wounded area, interjected.</p>, <p>“Ugh… Yes, captain. That ghoul’s corpse spewed some strange mucus at me!”</p>, <p>“If that’s the case…”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong’s eyes frantically rolled around the place.</p>, <p>He looked at Yeom Cheol-min, then at me, then at the fragmented ghoul’s corpse, back to Yeom Cheol-min, then at me again, at the ghoul’s corpse, and back at me, and at the ghoul’s corpse again… Oh, stop it!</p>, <p>“Ah, come on! Can’t you grasp the situation?!”</p>, <p>“No, no, I get it! Something did burst out, but you took it down, right?”</p>, <p>“Hmm… A nice summary, but slightly off.”</p>, <p>“What?

It’s not that a dead ghoul has come back to life.”</p>, <p>“Then what is it?”</p>, <p>“There must be someone here who’s possessed a dead ghoul and is using magic.”</p>, <p>The current situation deviates from the progression of the game.</p>, <p>Even from the moment I first arrived at this apartment complex, events I hadn’t experienced in the game had been occurring gradually. But I could sense that this was the most critical divergence yet.</p>, <p>In that deep darkness, where the sound of a bell rings, an event I’ve never seen in the game is unfolding.</p>, <p>I felt fear and tension, but strangely, an undeniable excitement and anticipation were also rising within me.</p>, <p>It seems odd to be thinking this way in a place where I could lose my life at any moment. Perhaps this is the greatest side effect of the [Madness of the Abyss] trait.</p>, <p>Even though I was having these thoughts, my body actively moved towards the danger, as if being sucked into the darkness. Ah, I can’t go alone.</p>, <p>“It’s in there. Follow me!”</p>, <p>“Ah, got it! Let’s go!”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong, who was impulsive by nature, boldly issued an order but his subordinates hesitated for a moment.</p>, <p>And understandably so, since they had just been suffering under the attack of ghouls. Some had sustained severe injuries, including lost limbs, while others showed signs of mild confusion or madness.</p>, <p>Asking them to march back into that deep darkness might have seemed too harsh.</p>, <p>As I was contemplating what more I could do, Kwak Dae-yong’s shout broke the silence.</p>, <p>“Idiots! Staying back clumsily is even more dangerous! Don’t you see that being near the mage increases your chances of survival?!”</p>, <p>“Eh…!?”</p>, <p>“What…??”</p>, <p>Turning around, I noticed the change in the way Kwak Dae-yong’s men were looking at me.</p>, <p>This was a bit embarrassing. But in this situation, it seemed better to show my worth through actions rather than words.</p>, <p><em>Rrrrrrrrrrrr!!</em></p>, <p>I increased my pace and, upon encountering more ghouls, unleashed a spell at them.</p>, <p>Might as well make it something spectacular.</p>, <p>[Uzet’s Fury]</p>, <p><em>Rumble……</em></p>, <p>A red glow, intertwining lightning and flame, surged tumultuously from my hands.</p>, <p><em>Kwagagagagagagaga!!!</em></p>, <p>The blazing bolts, which can only be aptly described as a thunderous inferno, carved sinister, swirling red paths through the air like serpentine branches.</p>, <p><em>– Krrrrrash!!</em></p>, <p><em>– Kieeeeeee!!!</em></p>, <p>The ghouls caught in the claws of the undulating flames and lightning that resembled a red dragon were quickly engulfed and charred as they started emitting black smoke.</p>, <p>“Ooh…”</p>, <p>A cry of admiration escaped my lips involuntarily.</p>, <p>The spell that was infused with flame was enhanced by the power of [Living Fire], which created an effect far larger and more spectacular than I had anticipated.</p>, <p>It was an excessively grand spell for just a few ghouls, but it did wonders in boosting the morale of Kwak Dae-yong’s men.</p>, <p>“Am… amazing…”</p>, <p>“Take us with you, Mage-nim!”</p>, <p>The sound of footsteps surged.</p>, <p>Seeing the mixture of relief and cheers, it seemed my actions were right. I started to move while expanding my magical detection range to ensure the safety of not only those ahead but also the people behind.</p>, <p>Originally, there were sixteen of us who descended into the basement, including myself. But now, whether due to falling behind or death, there were only fourteen remaining, myself included.</p>, <p>It was a nearly ominous number.</p>, <p>If even one person lagged behind or fell down, there was a risk of encountering that unlucky number.</p>, <p>[Madness: Triskaidekaphobia (Phobia of the number 13)]</p>, <p><em>Damn it, the last thing I need is an unnecessary penalty…</em></p>, <p>It was likely a different situation from the previous rat phobia, but I wanted to avoid any unnecessary complications.</p>, <p><em>Ding—</em></p>, <p>It was the sound of a bell. This time, it came from a deeper place.</p>, <p><em>Is it over there?</em></p>, <p>I had fully pinpointed the direction and distance of the sound.</p>, <p>The source of the bell was in the deepest part of this dark and damp underground parking lot.</p>, <p>We, meaning myself and Kwak Dae-yong along with his men, were now able to advance without hesitation.</p>, <p>There were injured members moving with the help of their comrades at the rear, but it signified that the revived morale and rationality of the security team were sufficient to defend against or even preemptively attack the ghouls.</p>, <p>I was riding on my skateboard and guided them forward.</p>, <p>“This way, and be careful. They’re going to start putting up a real fight now.”</p>, <p><em>– Screeeeeech!!!</em></p>, <p><em>– Aaaaaaaah!!!</em></p>, <p>To block our advance, the remaining ghouls charged with tenacious ferocity, but they couldn’t stop Kwak Dae-yong and his fully recovered troops.</p>, <p>“Yaaah!”</p>, <p><em>Ratatatatat!!</em></p>, <p>Whenever Kwak Dae-yong hurled a ghoul emerging from the darkness with his hammer, the shooting team responded with precise gunfire.</p>, <p>This was a typical tactic when facing monsters in which a team with strong physical abilities and special abilities takes on a monster.</p>, <p>And what accelerated our advance even more was…</p>, <p>[Lightning]</p>, <p><em>Fzzzzzzzt!!</em></p>, <p>[Shattering Ice Prison]</p>, <p><em>Crackkkk!!</em></p>, <p>Not to boast, but my magic indeed unleashed overwhelming power and cleared our path.</p>, <p><em>Now, I’ve become perfectly adept at using magic.</em></p>, <p>The magic I could wield was limited to just zero and first-order spells, but thanks to my [Spell Mastery] trait and immense magical power, I could unleash an array of spells.</p>, <p>“Wait.”</p>, <p>I who was riding ahead on my skateboard slowed down and signaled to Kwak Dae-yong’s group trailing behind.</p>, <p>It was clearly a situation where I needed to speed up, but I felt a strange sensation as if the [Enhanced Vigilance] was grabbing me by the back of my neck.</p>, <p><em>There’s something dangerous ahead.</em></p>, <p>Deep within.</p>, <p>Even deeper.</p>, <p>I had a rough idea of what lay there.</p>, <p>Before I even entered, I had already marked the spot.</p>, <p>It was the place connected by the mana lines emanating from my mana core.</p>, <p>A location where I had set up a protective circle. In essence, it was where the three survivors that Moon Seung-hee had been searching for were located.</p>, <p>However, my sensitive hearing and smell alerted me that, apart from the survivors, other entities were waiting there.</p>, <p>The stench of blood was so foul and pungent that it was nauseating.</p>, <p>And then…</p>, <p><em>Squish… squish… munch… crunch, crunch…</em></p>, <p>Blood oozed and dripped stickily.</p>, <p>Scattered all around were splatters of bright red, yellow, bruised blue, and an unpleasant grayish substance.</p>, <p>Flesh, intestines, bone fragments, and brain matter.</p>, <p>All had been butchered and gnawed upon by sharp nails and teeth.</p>, <p>We have reached the deepest part of the underground parking lot.</p>, <p>The innermost area of the underground parking lot.</p>, <p>A creepy space where construction was yet to finish, leaving bare concrete and wires exposed.</p>, <p>In the narrow spaces between pillars and walls, a tremendous number of corpses were piled up.</p>, <p>And there, several ghouls were feasting on the flesh with their faces buried in the bodies.</p>, <p><em>Fizz, munch, squish…</em></p>, <p>The monsters resembling humans showed little in the way of dining etiquette as they tore into human flesh.</p>, <p>A scene where human corpses, torn limb from limb, were piled up like mountains, with blood flowing from them like rivers.</p>, <p>The sight of fragmented intestines spilling out in all directions.</p>, <p>It was a sight so horrific and spine-chilling that any human would instinctively feel fear.</p>, <p>But something even more terrifying than all of that combined lay before us.</p>, <p>“Oh, my God…”</p>, <p>“What in the world is that…”</p>, <p>[System: ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ trait activated.]</p>, <p>[It is… a primitive and repulsive mural depicting bizarre shapes. The primal and fundamental patterns painted on the exterior wall of the underground parking lot seem to bring to life some kind of magical thought.]</p>, <p>Behind the pile of bodies on the gray concrete wall, a grotesque and nauseating painting was densely drawn.</p>, <p>Palm prints, smudged traces, clumps of red pigment dripping down, and human flesh and hair mixed into the pigment.</p>, <p>Evil and blasphemous patterns created by rubbing blood-soaked hands on the wall.</p>, <p>Shapes so strange and indescribable in human language.</p>, <p>Tentacles split into four parts.</p>, <p>An ominous shape resembling a snake.</p>, <p>No, not so much a snake, but something even more base… Yes, those were maggots.</p>, <p>Maggots feasting on a corpse.</p>, <p>The prowler among the tombs, the swirling darkness, and the king of man-eaters.</p>, <p>They were symbols meant to praise the [Father of All Ghouls] and to borrow his power.</p>, <p>And then there was the giant red hole painted in the center.</p>, <p>It wasn’t a hole. It was just a large red circle painted there.</p>, <p>Yet, that circle seemed almost like the gaping maw of a monstrous creature, threatening to swallow us whole.</p>, <p>Those devoured by this maw would be dragged to the deepest abyss.</p>, <p>[…This is not merely a painting. It is a magic circle meant to embody God’s power, authority, and will. The presence emanating from this picture is enough to shatter the human mind.

Sanity check… failed.]</p>, <p>Seeing such a thing wouldn’t immediately drive one mad, but repeated failures of sanity checks wear down mental strength. Eventually, madness manifests and the effects of distortion kick in.</p>, <p>If one is lucky, like Kwak Dae-yong earlier, they might exhibit strange behavior for a while before regaining their senses.</p>, <p>However, if one was unlucky or if their mental strength was already worn down to nothing, an indelible madness would manifest.</p>, <p>Such affected humans who reach the Abyss would either turn into monsters, become invalids, or in some cases, even transform into cultists worshipping the Abyss.</p>, <p>“Arghhhhhhh!”</p>, <p>“I want to go back! Let me out! This is all wrong!”</p>, <p>“Heh heh… Fu*k it… damn it…”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong’s men were already at their psychological limits.</p>, <p>The sight of the gigantic mural began to induce mild distortion among them.</p>, <p>“Idiots, snap out of it! It’s nothing! Just a painting!”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong’s voice could be heard berating his subordinates. It seemed he had successfully passed the sanity check this time?</p>, <p>Though it was slightly amusing to hear him shout at others, especially considering he was the first to succumb to the distortion, his actions were precisely what was needed in that moment.</p>, <p>[System: The special trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated. The effects of distortion are nullified.]</p>, <p>Of course, I too was faced with surreal terror, but with my special trait [Madness of the Abyss], no issue arose.</p>, <p>Instead, I had to focus on a more realistic problem.</p>, <p>“First off!”</p>, <p>I increased the speed of my skateboard and approached the ghouls.</p>, <p>This is no time to scream at the sight of a painting!

The prowler among the tombs…”</p>, <p>The old man continued as he slowly raised his trembling arms. A grating, phlegmy voice emanated from his lips.</p>, <p>“The prowler among the tombs, the greatest and mightiest of ghouls, the progenitor of the ghoul species, and the father of all ghouls who has bestowed his magnificent flesh upon this unworthy servant…”</p>, <p>I couldn’t help but let out a hollow laugh.</p>, <p>What is this bastard?</p>, <p>Was there such an NPC in the Demonic Cult, those who worship the [Father of All Ghouls]?</p>, <p>Judging by his condition, the level of magic he possessed, and the artifact in his hand, he was at least a high-ranking priest, if not the cult leader.</p>, <p>Even if I completed the ongoing “guests from the underworld” quest and followed it with the series of subsequent quests, no such character should appear.</p>, <p>An entity outside the game’s settings? Or just an NPC I had yet to encounter?</p>, <p>Numerous questions arose in my mind, but it seemed unlikely I’d get any answers.</p>, <p>The condition of the one who should provide those answers… did not look promising.</p>, <p>The old man holding the bell scratched his furrowed forehead furiously and was mumbling to himself incoherently.</p>, <p>“You came too soon, too soon. If only, if only you had been a little slower, we could have summoned more quality followers… Regrettable, so regrettable. We could have turned this entire building into our sacred temple, but we lacked enough sacrifices to gather more power… What a shame… a shame…”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong gritted his teeth in anger.</p>, <p>“Turn this place into your gathering spot?… This bastard…”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong, who interpreted the old man’s words in his own way, raised his hammer and shouted.</p>, <p>“This crazy old man! Who’s backing you to commit such filthy acts?”</p>, <p>“Kukuku… Backing? Backing? The only one who can command us is our Lord, only our Lord! Following the divine revelations and commands of our great leader, we prepared to conduct a major and holy ritual, yes, the underground ritual, to prepare for the feast… But then, these worthless trash, not even fit to be ghoul fodder, dare to interfere with the grand plan bestowed by the [Father of All Ghouls]…”</p>, <p>The old man wearing a sackcloth-like robe continued to rant and rave with unrelenting momentum.</p>, <p>Though this was my first experience with such an event, it wasn’t my first encounter with this kind of scenario.</p>, <p>The cultists, their minds deranged… no, having peered into the deep abyss and realized the truths of this world.</p>, <p>Their behavior was typically like this. Hmm… It’s a chore to listen to such ramblings without a skip button. I wish I could press skip.</p>, <p>Before I could do anything, Kwak Dae-yong had already intercepted the old man’s words.</p>, <p>“RItual? Lord? What kind of bullshit is this!”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong, who fell for the provocation, looked ready to wield his hammer and charge out at any moment.</p>, <p>But then again, rushing in here wouldn’t make any difference…</p>, <p>[Telepathy]</p>, <p>[Team Leader, forget that. I’ll handle this. Just take care of your men.]</p>, <p>“What? Oh… uh… okay.”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong was initially startled by my voice penetrating directly into his head, but he maintained his guard and slowly stepped back.</p>, <p>I lightly tapped him on the side and spoke slowly.</p>, <p>“Team Leader Kwak Dae-yong, this old man isn’t some fixer sent to lower the apartment’s sales price.”</p>, <p>“What are you saying? Then why is he pulling this crazy stunt?”</p>, <p>“It’s because of religious beliefs. Anyway, he’s not someone you can reason with, and if you keep listening, he’ll never stop expounding his worldview… no, rambling on with pointless talk. So just stop it.”</p>, <p>There must have been a bizarre and grand plan, beyond the comprehension of a normal human perspective or ideology.</p>, <p>The deviation from the original quest flow was probably due to the effect of [Feast Offering]. One of the beings from the abyss must have imparted a revelation to the old man.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>[Feast Offering]: Increased probability of encountering beings from the abyss; heightened chances of attracting their attention; an increase in the number of monsters appearing; an increased probability of elite monsters emerging.</p>, <p>/ You are the feast prepared for the beings of the abyss.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>And I suspected that if I stepped in, the true nature of things would soon be revealed.</p>, <p>“Yes, yes, you’re the one.”</p>, <p>Look at that. His expression changed.</p>, <p>The old man, with his bony and yellowed hand that wasn’t holding the bell, pointed at me and said,</p>, <p>“The great, the great Father of Ghouls has bestowed a revelation. The other world, the sacrifice brought from the other world, the feast offering. The Lord desires you, you.”</p>, <p>A sacrifice brought from the other world?</p>, <p>“Hey, what does that mean?”</p>, <p>“Kukuku… With more than a hundred of our kind slain and having earned the title of a slayer, we cannot waste our pitiful kin on you… For the grand, the grand advent, the beautiful, the beautiful time of destruction, become the burnt offering, offering.”</p>, <p>Crazy, there was no reasoning with him. If I had known it would come to this, I should have struck first instead of wasting time listening to that nonsense.</p>, <p>The old man, a cultist of the Demonic order and a Ghoul Shaman, or Oungan (a voodoo priest), slowly retreated while shaking the silver bell he held in his hand.</p>, <p><em>Ding—</em></p>, <p>A sinister green mist charged with dark magic began to gather around the old man.</p>, <p>“Ah, damn it. He’s transforming! Stop him!”</p>, <p>“What? Transforming?”</p>, <p>Although I spoke to Kwak Dae-yong, that idiot failed to grasp my intent and panicked. Ah, damn it! Among the spells I could use now, the fastest was…</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p><em>Ssssssssss… Bang!</em></p>, <p>The magic from the nether realm burst out, emitting a bizarrely colored radiance.</p>, <p>As the magic projectile flew, I pushed more magical power into it, adding new properties, directions, and destructive power.</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Zzzzshshshshsh!!</em></p>, <p>The magic projectile that received the new will and magical power split in the air, took the shape of spewing buckshot and flew away over a wide area.</p>, <p><em>Kwagagagagaga!!</em></p>, <p>But it was already too late. Before the sound of the explosion from the hit could be heard, I had an intuition of what had happened.</p>, <p>The old man had already moved out of the range of the magic projectile at lightning speed.</p>, <p>“He’s gone!”</p>, <p>“Where is he? What’s going on?”</p>, <p>Chaotic shouts erupted among the security team members.</p>, <p>In their attempt to locate the vanished old man, their handheld lights moved erratically.</p>, <p>But all that was visible were bizarre murals, the sprawled bodies of ghouls, and the shattered, scattered remains of humans.</p>, <p>Ah, really. Aren’t these guys employed for their skills? Is this really all they can do?</p>, <p>“There! [Fireball]!”</p>, <p><em>Whooooosh!!</em></p>, <p>The magical power escaping from my body condensed into a massive sphere ball of flame, glowing red with intense heat.</p>, <p>The fireball flew through the darkness of the underground parking lot with unhindered speed, the light from the roaring flames clearing away the damp darkness and revealing the figure of the old man hiding among them.</p>, <p>But before the fire could engulf the old man, two ghouls leaped out from the shadows…</p>, <p><em>– Kieeeeee!!</em></p>, <p><em>– Kukieeeeeh!!</em></p>, <p>Boom!!</p>, <p>The fireball, precisely directed and angled, was unfortunately intercepted and exploded in mid-air when two ghouls suddenly leaped into its path.</p>, <p>“Kuhahahaa! See, see? For the glory of the great, great prowler among the tombs, the children of the father throw themselves like dogs!”</p>, <p>Damn it, his faith and the artifact he held were genuine, despite his cheap incantations and crude magic.</p>, <p>In response to his wish, the great being dwelling deep in the abyss granted him new power.</p>, <p>[The Father of All Ghouls].</p>, <p>“Krrrrrr…”</p>, <p>His face, wrinkled like an old tree trunk, was grotesquely twisted.</p>, <p>His snout elongated, and large fangs emerged.</p>, <p>And then there was the sticky green mist enveloping his body.</p>, <p>It moved like a tangible bundle of ropes or a cloak, stickily wrapping around him.</p>, <p>“He’s turning into a monster!”</p>, <p>Someone among Yeonam’s security team shouted.</p>, <p>“Shoot! Shoot him before it’s too late!”</p>, <p><em>Ratatatatatata!!!</em></p>, <p>The ominous green mist and the cold eerie aura.</p>, <p>hundreds of bullets poured out from about ten gun barrels, but for some reason they couldn’t penetrate the green mist surrounding the old man, or rather, the ghoul shaman who had now mutated into a completely grotesque form.</p>, <p>As if getting lost in the mist, the bullets that flew under precise aim had their trajectories bent the moment they came into contact with the mist and scattered in a random direction.</p>, <p>Even those who mainly wielded melee weapons hesitated to approach the bizarre ghoul shaman.</p>, <p>“Keh… Kekkekkek…”</p>, <p>A strange laughter erupted from the ghoul shaman.</p>, <p>His body slowly tilted, not falling but swaying in an odd posture. Then, suddenly lifting one foot off the ground…</p>, <p><em>Boom!!</em></p>, <p>It wasn’t an explosion. It was the sound of the ghoul shaman rolling his foot.</p>, <p>“Aaaaargh!!”</p>, <p>The ghoul shaman, having amassed a great deal of magical power, stamped his foot once, and then his body disappeared.</p>, <p>Incredible speed.</p>, <p><em>Ssss!</em></p>, <p>The ghoul shaman reappeared in the middle of the security team and struck the head of the closest team member.</p>, <p>Crack!</p>, <p>With a casual swing of his fist, a person’s head was pulled out in an instant by the ghoul shaman.</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!!!</em></p>, <p>Blood gushed in an incredible volume from the severed head, which was only left with its lower jaw, staining the ceiling of the underground parking lot, where the concrete framework was exposed.</p>, <p>The ghoul shaman momentarily gazed at his blood-soaked hand before slowly opening his mouth.</p>, <p>The skin on his face had not yet stretched sufficiently to support his mouth, which elongated like a ghoul’s snout.</p>, <p>Eventually, his cheeks were unable to bear the excessively stretched snout and tore apart with a ripping sound.</p>, <p>He extended his long tongue and leisurely licked the blood off his hand.</p>, <p>“Kuhehe, kukukukuku… Delicious.”</p>, <p>Bizarre speed and unfathomable strength.</p>, <p>And a scene of utter horror.</p>, <p>Regardless of my will or emotions, a message window popped up and obscured my vision.</p>, <p>[Your mind cannot comprehend this horrific scene. You resist the fear with your Mental Strength stat. Sanity check… Success.]</p>, <p>However, among the ranks of the security team, screams erupted from those who couldn’t overcome the situation.</p>, <p>“Aaaaaah!!!”</p>, <p>The ranks of the bewildered security team fell into disarray.

            "[<p>“Dieee!!”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong’s [Berserker] trait came into play.</p>, <p>[When distortion occurs, the distortion inevitably manifests itself as ‘violence’.]</p>, <p>This trait, which was almost akin to a penalty, shone for the first time in a while.</p>, <p>Whether the opponent was stronger or not, while others might turn and flee, Kwak Dae-yong attacked his enemy with all his might.</p>, <p>With a thunderous roar, his battle hammer swung with ferocious force.</p>, <p><em>Boom!!</em></p>, <p>But… the ghoul shaman blocked the attack effortlessly.</p>, <p>Even with just one hand.</p>, <p>He held the end of Kwak Dae-yong’s hammer with just one hand.</p>, <p>“Guh!”</p>, <p>“Kukukuku… Why, why so? Can’t you even handle the strength of this tiny, tiny old man?”</p>, <p>“Grrrrr…!!!”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong grasped the handle of the hammer with both hands and pulled with all his strength, but the hammer didn’t budge.</p>, <p>[Flame Eruption]</p>, <p>Although still a considerable distance from the ghoul shaman, I concentrated magical power into the flames, enhancing both range and power.</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Range Increase]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Kiiiiing!!</em></p>, <p>The ghoul shaman was taken aback and he screamed upon noticing a bright red magic circle forming right beside him.</p>, <p>“Wh-what is this?!”</p>, <p>Before he could react, a massive flame, comparable to a dragon’s breath, erupted from the glowing red magic circle as if it were about to explode at any moment.</p>, <p><em>Fwooosh!!!</em></p>, <p>The enormous blaze illuminated the dark underground parking lot so brightly that it was visible in a single glance.</p>, <p>The surrounding air was distorted, and the heat was so intense that even I, standing far away, could feel it.</p>, <p>The flames, which possessed not only heat but also the physical power to push away enemies, hurled the ghoul shaman’s small body far away.</p>, <p>“Aaaaagh!”</p>, <p>“Sa-save me!”</p>, <p>These were the screams of Kwak Dae-yong and his men.</p>, <p>The flames raged without stopping, reaching all the way around Kwak Dae-yong and his subordinates, causing them to crouch and struggle in an attempt to dodge the fiery onslaught.</p>, <p>But the spell had been activated with all this in mind.</p>, <p>The power of the flames was immense, yet they were released at a perfectly tuned angle and direction, with the spread being completely controlled.</p>, <p>This was thanks to my ability to manipulate every strand of the magic lines scattering in all directions.</p>, <p>Thanks to that, not only the inner walls of the underground parking lot but also Kwak Dae-yong, who had been facing the ghoul shaman in a standoff, remained unaffected by the flames.</p>, <p>“Ughhh…”</p>, <p>“Ho-how did this happen?”</p>, <p>While Kwak Dae-yong’s gang was making dumb noises as they watched the dying flames, I turned my gaze toward the ghoul shaman.</p>, <p>Just moments ago, he had been struck directly by the flames and was hurled far away before crumpling to the ground…</p>, <p><em>I suppose that won’t be enough, will it?</em></p>, <p>“Kuha! Kuhahaha! Oh great, great Father of Ghouls! Prowler among the tombs!”</p>, <p>As expected.</p>, <p>Of course, he wasn’t unscathed.</p>, <p>His whole body was blackened, the skin on his face peeled off revealing raw red flesh, and his eyelids and nose had been scorched away.</p>, <p>Such injuries would have debilitated a normal person and robbed them of their ability to fight in an instant.</p>, <p>But to him, driven by horrific madness and twisted faith, these wounds only seemed to heighten his frenzy.</p>, <p>“Come forth! You worms crawling in the underground! Blessings of the abyssal chasm!”</p>, <p>A newly swirling green mist enveloped his body.</p>, <p>His body began to distort.</p>, <p>Although his lost skin and flesh did not return, the exposed muscles and blood vessels beneath the peeled skin writhed, transforming into a stronger and more grotesque form.</p>, <p>The skull, which had begun to develop into a shape similar to that of a ghoul, twisted further and further into the shape of a terrible monster.</p>, <p>This bizarre form could no longer be called human. Yet, it wasn’t a ghoul either.</p>, <p>It was simply a monster.</p>, <p>A monster reborn with the blessings of an outer god, a being from the abyss, a great ancient being.</p>, <p>“Kuhahahaha!!”</p>, <p>The ghoul shaman who has taken on a truly ugly and grotesque form burst into a frenzied laughter before he leaped.</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>From the floor to the ceiling,</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>From the ceiling to pillars,</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>And then back from the pillars to the floor,</p>, <p>He moved with unstoppable force.</p>, <p>He moved throughout the interior of the underground parking lot with such power that the floors, walls, and pillars he touched were destroyed.</p>, <p>On seeing this, an involuntary gasp of frustration escaped my lips.</p>, <p>“Aaah, come on, you’ve got to do it in moderation; what the hell is this?”</p>, <p>Even a monkey couldn’t move like that; it was an absurd level of agility. Despite [Cthulhu World] being a game notorious for its unbalanced nature, I never encountered an enemy of this level at this stage.</p>, <p>“Kukyakyakyakya! Mage of the other world! The feast offering! Become the beacon for the great, great new era!”</p>, <p>The ghoul shaman dynamically rotated his entire body and rapidly closed the distance.</p>, <p>In my vision, I saw his filthy barefoot enlarging at an incredible speed. No, that’s a…</p>, <p><em>Kick?</em></p>, <p>What appeared to the eye was a frail old man’s kick, but it was a vicious, high-speed kick laden with malevolent energy.</p>, <p>If such an attack hit my weakened body… I would be shattered into pieces!

Blocked??? Blocked?????”</p>, <p>The ghoul shaman widened one eye in anger, his head tilting this way and that in the manner of a typical madman.</p>, <p>The ghoul shaman spun around widely in that posture.</p>, <p><em>Whirl!</em></p>, <p>This time, a fist flew towards me.</p>, <p><em>Boom, boom, boooom!!</em></p>, <p>Following the kick, a barrage of punches came indiscriminately.</p>, <p><em>Crack, crack, craaack!!!</em></p>, <p>Eventually, the impact exceeded its limit. The protective circle was unable to withstand it and began to disintegrate.</p>, <p>“This…crazy old man…!”</p>, <p>“Such a feeble shield!”</p>, <p><em>Crackkk!!</em></p>, <p>Oh no, this is crazy. The ghoul shaman then put his hand through the hole in the protective circle and began to tear it apart, thrusting his face into the interior of the circle.</p>, <p>His dreadful face, melted and disfigured by flames, drew extremely close.</p>, <p>“Kyaaak!”</p>, <p>The creature, with a mouth elongated like a dog’s snout, opened it wide to bite at me. The grotesque, unevenly placed fangs in that hideous mouth gleamed menacingly.</p>, <p>I shifted my body slightly, narrowly escaping his attack range, and activated the spell I had prepared.</p>, <p>[Thorn Trap]</p>, <p><em>Kwajijiji!!</em></p>, <p>Dozens of blades conjured out of thin air impaled the ghoul shaman’s snout, tongue, and head.</p>, <p>“Argh!”</p>, <p>Blood spurted from his arm, but a green mist quickly enveloped him, destroying the blades lodged in his face.</p>, <p>“Hahaha! See? My lord protects me!”</p>, <p>“Be quiet, you dog-faced brute!”</p>, <p>[Lightning]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Fzzzzzzt!!!</em></p>, <p>Blinding white electric light enveloped his body.</p>, <p>“Aaaaargh!!

Glory to the darkness and decay of the underground! Glory to the worms and the flesh-devouring death of the underworld! All hail, all hail the great darkness!”</p>, <p>Damn, he’s too sturdy. This isn’t working.</p>, <p>The abyssal entity that backs him, [Father of All Ghouls], doesn’t grant the power of regeneration.</p>, <p>It only provides a madness that allows movement even if the limbs are decaying and crushed.</p>, <p>Despite what must have been excruciating pain, he continued to charge at me like a demonic entity.</p>, <p>Damn, this approach is futile.</p>, <p>But that doesn’t mean there are no other ways. It just requires a completely different tactic than the beating, crushing, and burning I’ve been using.</p>, <p>I hopped onto the skateboard lying next to me and activated a new spell.</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>What I invoked this time was a zero-order spell that exerted a simple form of telekinesis.</p>, <p>The goal was not that insane ghoul shaman.</p>, <p>A transparent and gigantic palm-shaped magical field grasped me and pushed me backward.</p>, <p><em>Rrrrrrrrr—</em></p>, <p>The sound of the board rolling echoed as I quickly increased the distance between myself and the ghoul shaman.</p>, <p>This board, aided by magic, could reach speeds capable of outrunning biker gangs in a chase, but…</p>, <p>“Kuhu. Kuhuhuhaha!”</p>, <p>The ghoul shaman, now emitting incomprehensible, bizarre noises, charged at me.</p>, <p>These were the words of a fanatic who had accepted the support and gifts of an abyssal entity.</p>, <p>A monster that had lost its self.

But what a mess you are in.”</p>, <p>“Wh-what did you say?”</p>, <p>“Your control. It’s a complete mess. Should you really be losing a gift given by the god you worship so easily?”</p>, <p>You’re using this precious, high-purity magical power just to wear it around your body and show off your brute strength?</p>, <p>Where have the processes of control, absorption, purification, transformation, and reconfiguration gone?… This is no different from a primitive using crude oil to light a fire.</p>, <p>“You bastard…!”</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>, <p>His fist flew towards me but it was noticeably slower than before.</p>, <p>I easily dodged the fist and swung my own at the ghoul shaman.</p>, <p><em>Thump!</em></p>, <p>As soon as my fist connected, I injected magical power into his body.</p>, <p>This is followed by condensation, reconfiguration, transformation, and explosion.</p>, <p>“Now, get lost!”</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Grrrrrrrrr…</em></p>, <p>Within his body…. a fireball brimming with lethal firepower was formed.</p>, <p>“Stop, stop it! Stoooop… Aaaahhhhh!”</p>, <p>From every hole pierced in the body of the ghoul shaman, crimson flames erupted.</p>, <p>His entire body split apart…</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>Ashes, flesh, and bone fragments scattered in all directions.</p>, <p>The ghoul shaman vanished from the world without leaving anything that could be called a corpse behind.</p>, <p><em>Thump, Ding</em></p>, <p>Then, a silver bell fell to the ground with a soft clink.</p>, <p>“Phew…”</p>, <p>I could have moved more efficiently, but to be honest, I was caught off guard which made things unnecessarily difficult. Is this the end, now that the ghouls won’t be replenished?</p>, <p>I slowly approached and picked up the artifact that the ghoul shaman had wielded: the silver bell.</p>, <p>[Silver Bell of the Underworld (S-rank Magical Tool): A ritual tool crafted from pure silver mined by ghouls.</p>, <p>It bestows upon its owner tremendous magical power along with terrifying madness.</p>, <p>This item belongs to the abyss. The more it is used, the more your body and mind will evolve to suit it.</p>, <p>Gift of the Underworld: The blessing bestowed by the father of all ghouls envelops you. As long as this blessing is maintained, all stats increase by 50~700%, and effects such as stun, shock, disorientation, and pain are ignored. However, while this effect is active, magical, psychic, spiritual, and divine abilities cannot be used.</p>, <p>Pure Silver’s Dominance: Automatically casts the ‘Voice of Authority’ spell on a designated target and enhances the effects of ‘Mind’ spells by 100%.</p>, <p>Pure Silver Charm: Grants a +2 charisma bonus exclusively to ghouls, undead, and demons.</p>, <p>Pure Silver Madness: Bestows ‘Madness—Violence’ on summoned creatures and increases their attack power by 100%…]</p>, <p>“All stats increased by 700%?”</p>, <p>What is this? Just what kind of unbalanced artifact is this?</p>, <p>It was certainly the first time I had seen such an item.</p>, <p>I had seen a few items related to ghouls before, but none with abilities of this magnitude.</p>, <p>“It’s quite impressive, but… the penalty is problematic.”</p>, <p>Madness, distortion, and the influence of the [Father of All Ghouls], a being from the abyss and a great ancient entity, could be ignored thanks to the unique trait [Madness of the Abyss], but the physical transformations couldn’t be prevented.</p>, <p>A face grotesquely mutated and limbs twisted out of shape…</p>, <p>And with more use, I would completely turn into a ghoul.</p>, <p>No matter how enticing the powers, I had no desire to end up like that.</p>, <p>I breathed a complex magic circle into the silver bell I held in my hand.</p>, <p>[Breath of Severance]</p>, <p>A first-order sealing spell. Crystals that looked like pale frost formed on the silver bell where my breath touched.</p>, <p>This was an item that was too closely related to the Abyss.</p>, <p>I was already suffering from spam-like nightmares every night due to the [Ring of Corrupted Flame], so I had no intention of adding another source of torment to my list.</p>, <p>After invoking a few more spells and adding several layers of safeguards, I was finally able to push the [Silver Bell of the Underworld] into my backpack.</p>, <p>For now, this should be enough.</p>, <p>Once I set up a proper workshop, I would be able to deal with it more definitively.</p>, <p>After gathering my backpack I turned towards the spot where the ghoul shaman had been… now only a few coal-like fragments and some soot remained.</p>, <p>“It’s time for you to return.”</p>, <p>At my command, a creature of gluttony that had been writhing in the ashes of what was once the ghoul shaman responded with a strange noise.</p>, <p>“Grrrr…”</p>, <p>At first glance, it resembled an octopus.</p>, <p>However, it was a bizarre monster with multiple mouths akin to those of humans where one would expect the head of an octopus to be.</p>, <p>“Grrrrr…!”</p>, <p>Having devoured the magical power and “blessing” imbued in the body of the ghoul shaman, it swelled significantly larger than before. Initially, it was no bigger than a palm-sized baby squid, but now it had certainly grown to the size of a soccer ball.</p>, <p>The creature, having swelled in size, seemed to have gained intelligence or perhaps self-awareness, for it ignored my words and backed away tentatively, baring its teeth located all over its head and growling menacingly.</p>, <p>Being bitten by those teeth would surely be painful.</p>, <p>“Hey, stop fooling around and come back.”</p>, <p>I glared at the creature of gluttony and gathered my magical power.</p>, <p>Even though my face contorted so much that it felt like my facial muscles were straining, my face was hidden behind a mask and was hence invisible.</p>, <p>However, whether it was due to the surge of magical power or simply sensing my anger, the creature flinched and approached me.</p>, <p>“Grrr…”</p>, <p>I placed my hand on the creature’s head and spoke the pre-set command words.</p>, <p>“You have fulfilled the duties and commands I bestowed upon you. Now cease to exist.”</p>, <p><em>Gurgle… Gurgle… Grrrrr…</em></p>, <p>The octopus-like body began to contract and harden slowly…before it transformed into a completely different form.</p>, <p>It became a crystallized essence, refined from the life force, magic, and the “blessing” it had stolen from the enemy.</p>, <p>In other words, it transformed into a magic stone.</p>, <p>“I didn’t expect it to turn out this well…”</p>, <p>The magic stone was of incredible purity, not to mention its size and weight.</p>, <p>It was almost frightening to touch.</p>, <p>Can this be converted into currency? and if so, how much it would fetch; I had no idea.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, I put it in my backpack and slowly turned my head.</p>, <p>One task was completed… Now it was time to rescue the survivors that Moon Seung-hee had been looking for.</p>, <p>The protective circle guarding the survivors was still active.</p>, <p>When I was about to check the state of the protective circle, Kwak Dae-yong approached from behind and spoke up.</p>, <p>“You, you… really…”</p>, <p>What nonsense was he about to spout?</p>, <p>When I turned my head and looked at Kwak Dae-yong, he was making a truly unexpected expression.</p>, <p>“You!”</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>“You’re really amazing!”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>“I’ve seen plenty of mediocre, bland mages before! But you, ah, a mage like you is a first!”</p>, <p>I almost burst into laughter.</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong’s face was filled with emotion: admiration, envy, aspiration… Well, emotions of that sort.</p>, <p>“If you hadn’t hidden your skills, I wouldn’t have misunderstood you from the start…”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong kept talking, but in the end, it was just a repetition of the same story.</p>, <p>“Who’s hiding their skills? And what misunderstanding? It’s team leader Kwak Dae-yong’s character that is rotten.”</p>, <p>Even though my response was an outright insult, Kwak Dae-yong’s expression didn’t change.</p>, <p>“Ah, come on. Can’t you let it slide this time? I’ve really changed my view of you. Is there any chance we could continue working together in the future? Huh? Don’t you have a business card or something?”</p>, <p>“I don’t. And anyway, team leader Kwak Dae-yong doesn’t have the authority to decide on external personnel, does he?”</p>, <p>“Ah, really. If I talk to Human Resources, huh? Wouldn’t they consider it?”</p>, <p>As if he could make any demands when he can’t even stand up to Moon Seung-hee.</p>, <p>I came here intending to show them my worth, but could their attitude really change this much? Then again, considering I’ve saved their lives several times in this short period of time, it would be annoying if their attitude hadn’t changed at all.</p>, <p>“No need. If you have something you want to say, tell someone with authority through Vasilisa. We’re not done here yet.”</p>, <p>“Not done? We’ve taken care of the ghouls and even the necromancer who summoned them. What else is there to do now?”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>I paused for a moment and looked at him.</p>, <p>“What’s the matter? Why are you looking at me like that?”</p>, <p>I gave him a look reserved for retards, but it seemed my disdain and disregard failed to convey as my face was hidden behind a mask.</p>, <p>“Team leader Kwak Dae-yong, are you foolish? We need to save the survivors.”</p>, <p>“Survivors?”</p>, <p>Indeed, about 24 hours had passed since the ghouls first appeared.</p>, <p>It was hard to imagine anyone surviving for 24 hours in a closed space swarmed by over a hundred ghouls.</p>, <p>Yet, there were survivors.</p>, <p>They had been alive when I arrived at this apartment complex.</p>, <p>And… I had cast a spell to save him.</p>, <p>Since the magic I cast was still in effect… that person should also still be alive.</p>, <p>“It’s over there.”</p>, <p>“That place is… where we saw… earlier.”</p>, <p>The location of the survivors, naturally, was the innermost part of the underground parking lot, where we had previously discovered the bizarre mural, traces of a ritual, and a pile of corpses.</p>, <p>“That’s… I mean… those are bodies, bodies aren’t they?”</p>, <p>“Yes, I was protecting something hidden among those bodies.”</p>, <p>“Through magic, magic you mean?”</p>, <p>“Team Leader Kwak Dae-yong, do you realize you’re talking like that dead cultist?”</p>, <p>“No, no… well…”</p>, <p>Anyway, I dragged Kwak Dae-yong and approached the pile of corpses.</p>, <p>“Roughly thirty or so?”</p>, <p>“People… you’re saying there’s someone alive in here…?”</p>, <p>“They should be around here.”</p>, <p>The innermost part of the heap of corpses.</p>, <p>There, the protective circle I had remotely installed before remains.</p>, <p>To go further inside… we have no choice but to step on the bodies. Namo Amitabha.</p>, <p><em>Squish, squish…</em></p>, <p>Blood that had flowed out and unidentifiable flesh parts were stepped on.</p>, <p>“Ugh…”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong shuddered slightly and stepped back.</p>, <p><em>“Squish… squish…”</em></p>, <p>This was because he could hear slurred voices among the corpses.</p>, <p>“There it is.”</p>, <p>On closer inspection, a person was crouching and hiding among the heap of bodies.</p>, <p>“Squish… squish…”</p>, <p><em>It seems they survived longer than the others by hiding among the corpses.</em></p>, <p>There were three survivors in total.</p>, <p>Had I not arrived and cast a spell immediately, they likely wouldn’t have survived until now.</p>, <p>Was it a coincidence? Regardless, one of the survivors, as Moon Seung-hee had hoped, was a woman.</p>, <p><em>No, rather than coincidence…</em></p>, <p>It might have been a contrived setting prepared by someone on purpose. After all, this was the world of a game.</p>, <p>“Hehehe… Heh heh heh… Kikik, Kuhuhu…”</p>, <p>Though I had helped them with magic when I arrived here, they had already managed to survive in the underground parking lot that was swarming with over a hundred ghouls for at least a full day.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>I played [Cthulhu World] thousands of times, but this was the first time I found myself saving someone in this place and at this moment.</p>, <p>To say I wasn’t excited would be a lie. What events and developments would this action spark?</p>, <p>“Hey, come on, hey, snap out of it.”</p>, <p>I extended my hand towards the woman burying her body among the corpses.</p>, <p>“Eeek, Huwaaa. Monster! Monster! Die!!! Dieeeee!!!!”</p>, <p>“Ah…”</p>, <p>Right, the mask was the problem.</p>, <p>The woman was already in such a fragile state, so the sight of my mask sent her into utter panic.</p>, <p>I glanced briefly at Kwak Dae-yong who was a few steps behind me, but his face was hardly reassuring either.</p>, <p>“Tsk. I’m here to save you. Just be quiet for a moment!”</p>, <p>But it was no use.</p>, <p>“Arrrrgh! Gyaaaah!”</p>, <p><em>Squish! Squish!</em></p>, <p>Even the two other survivors nearby began to tremble in response to her screams.</p>, <p>Eventually, I concentrated magical power into one hand and clenched it into a fist.</p>, <p>[Ka’s Golden Sand]</p>, <p><em>Ssssss…</em></p>, <p>As the spell activated, faintly glowing golden sand began to softly pour from between my fists.</p>, <p>It was magical sand imbued with the power of sleep.</p>, <p>Even though this was a space devoid of any wind, the sand slowly rose into the air and showered over the faces of the survivors. The people who had been going crazy and rioting soon fell into a deep sleep.</p>, <p>I called out to Kwak Dae-yong.</p>, <p>“Team leader Kwak Dae-yong, quickly gather your men and take care of these people.”</p>, <p>“Y-Yes, understood.”</p>, <p>I had eliminated the ghouls and the unknown ghoul shaman who had summoned them, and I had even rescued three survivors, just as Moon Seung-hee had requested in the sub-quest.</p>, <p>Yet the reason the reward hadn’t appeared yet was…</p>, <p>[&lt;Hunting Quest: Guests from the Underworld&gt;</p>, <p>Ghouls have appeared in the underground of an apartment building under construction.</p>, <p>Defeat the ghouls and make the underground parking lot ‘safe’.</p>, <p>Remaining targets: 167/67</p>, <p>Reward: 350,000 XP (+ the monetary reward promised by the broker is separate.) Failure: Hostile relationship with Yeonam Construction.]</p>, <p><em>Is it because it’s not yet considered safe?’</em></p>, <p>The situation was very different from the quest I experienced in the original game, so I found it difficult to intuitively grasp the clear conditions.</p>, <p>While I was thinking and observing the security team members in motion, Kwak Dae-yong approached me.</p>, <p>Why does he keep bothering me instead of taking care of his men?</p>, <p>“Well…After taking a quick look, it seems all the missing people were gathered here.”</p>, <p>“I see.”</p>, <p>“Is there anything else we should be cautious of? This place was under the influence of some cultist…. and I’m hesitant to have my men check directly.”</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>Just when I thought he was being needlessly friendly, it turns out he was trying to use me.</p>, <p>With the quest completion notification still pending, I decided to play along for now.</p>, <p>It may be an empty parking lot, but with columns, curved walls, and space for elevators and stairs in the middle, there are blind spots no matter how well you light it.</p>, <p>I decided to use my spells to scan the unexplored depths of the underground parking lot.</p>, <p>[Remote Detection]</p>, <p>[Curse Detection]</p>, <p>[Trap Detection]</p>, <p>[Magic Detection]</p>, <p>[Detection… Complete.]</p>, <p>“Indeed, as Team Leader Kwak Dae-yong said, there were still matters left to address.”</p>, <p>“Ugh, so there was something after all? Good thing I asked.”</p>, <p>“No, it’s nothing too significant. After all, the team leader has seen it before.”</p>, <p>“Seen it before?”</p>, <p>“Yes, that.”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong shone a light in the direction I was pointing.</p>, <p>Near a pile of bodies there was a hazard that remained unaddressed. A special place that had never appeared in the game before….it likely emerged due to the intervention of a being from the abyss.</p>, <p>“Ugh, that?”</p>, <p>A giant mural painted on the outer wall of the underground parking lot.</p>, <p>It was a product of madness that felt even more sinister due to the lack of proper lighting.</p>, <p>“Right. The mural itself is imbued with magical power, so leaving it alone could cause problems in some way or another.”</p>, <p>“Problems… like what?”</p>, <p>“Well, it’s also serving as a kind of portal. Ghouls could pour out through that red circle again.”</p>, <p>“Ugh, please do something about it…! I mean, can you?”</p>, <p>“Hmm… maybe? But just so you know, this will cost extra money.”</p>, <p>“I-I understand. I get it.”</p>, <p>“Good. No changing your tune later.”</p>, <p>“Hurry up. I’m sick of ghouls.”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong made a face of disgust, which I brushed off with a laugh as we started walking toward the mural. But then he made a groaning sound and hesitated.</p>, <p>“Won’t you be fine on your own?”</p>, <p>That subtle tone in Kwak Dae-yong’s voice. This bastard, he intended to shove the responsibility onto me after I went along with his bullsh*t earlier.</p>, <p>“What are you talking about? Come on.”</p>, <p>“Ugh… okay.”</p>, <p>Unlike before, Kwak Dae-yong was now completely compliant.</p>, <p>Though he was a regular employee of a corporation, at his core, he was no different from the fixers of Paju.</p>, <p>Knowing whom to follow in the field to ensure one’s survival is a skill. That’s the secret to extending one’s life as a fixer.</p>, <p>I walked inside with Kwak Dae-yong leading the way.</p>, <p>I am a mage after all. In places where the unexpected might occur, isn’t it common sense for the sturdy vanguard to take the lead?</p>, <p>The distance between the mural and the pile of bodies wasn’t far, but as I approached the mural, I could feel where the oppressive atmosphere filling this underground parking lot was emanating from.</p>, <p>A malice so thick that the air felt sticky, and the smell of decay that seemed to be coming from the abyss itself.</p>, <p>Unlike me, who has an innate resistance and affinity for magic, Kwak Dae-yong seemed to struggle with each step he took. This short walk must have felt to him like sinking into a bog hundreds of meters deep.</p>, <p>With no intention of tormenting Kwak Dae-yong further, I grabbed his shoulder at an appropriate moment to stop him.</p>, <p>“This is as far as you go.”</p>, <p>“Ugh, I can go… further.”</p>, <p>“No, there’s no need.”</p>, <p>Leaving the pale-faced Kwak Dae-yong behind, I walked a few more steps forward.</p>, <p>“What the hell is this…? I’ve never seen anything so horrific in my life.”</p>, <p>It was a symbol of the abyss, drawn with human blood, guts, and flesh.</p>, <p>Snakes, maggots, whirlpools, corpses, death, and ghouls.</p>, <p>First, I explained to Kwak Dae-yong who was gaping and hesitating what this was all about.</p>, <p>“It’s nothing extraordinary. It’s just borrowing the power of a great ancient being to summon ghouls.”</p>, <p>“To be used as a ritual offering… So, that’s why people were brought here…?”</p>, <p>“It seems so. To summon as many as a hundred ghouls, a ritual of this magnitude is necessary.”</p>, <p>“Wait, something doesn’t add up. The ghouls were the ones who kidnapped people in the first place. What about the ghouls that appeared before using the kidnapped people to summon more? Could there be another tunnel somewhere else?”</p>, <p>While it was a valid point, that wasn’t the case.</p>, <p>“No, this mural is the end. Though it appears to be a single painting to the human eye, it was actually painted in several stages.”</p>, <p>I pointed to a part of the mural and continued.</p>, <p>“This section, in particular, was clearly painted by someone else. The magic contained is different, and the quality is inferior. Likely it was done by a cultist who infiltrated as a laborer or by brainwashing a few laborers.”</p>, <p>At first, a handful of ghouls were summoned through a simple spell to create chaos, and during this turmoil, captured individuals were offered as sacrifices for additional rituals. After explaining the circumstances, Kwak Dae-yong clenched his teeth in frustration.</p>, <p>“Damn it… If we hadn’t waited and just stormed in from the start, we could have avoided all this trouble?”</p>, <p>“That’s one way to look at it. Speaking of which…. can this apartment ever be sold normally?”</p>, <p>So many people had died. No matter how much they tried to hide it or deal with it, it was impossible for rumors not to spread.</p>, <p>“Hmm… Maybe if we hide it well enough… No, the higher-ups will probably handle it.”</p>, <p>It wasn’t Kwak Dae-yong’s decision to make regarding the sale of the property anyway, so asking him was pointless.</p>, <p>“Right, they’ll find a way. It’s not like they’re a large company for nothing.”</p>, <p>“More importantly, hurry up and take care of that mural.”</p>, <p>“Yeah, I understand.”</p>, <p>I responded appropriately and examined the mural. Even though the conductor of the ritual had died and the father of all ghouls, the source of the magical power, had lost interest, the patterns and murals had not yet completely lost their power.</p>, <p>What would be the best way to deal with this…?</p>, <p>Should I use that spell again? I recalled the spell I had first used a month ago.</p>, <p>[Flame that Burns Sin]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh…!</em></p>, <p>Pure white flames that deny, erase, and extinguish the feats, gifts, and miracles of gods began to envelop the wall.</p>, <p>The bright white light that blossomed forth momentarily dispelled the sticky darkness pooling in this underground parking lot and created a bright illumination.</p>, <p><em>Chrrrrrrrr…</em></p>, <p>The bloodstains and patterns writhed, emitting bizarre noises as if they were living beings with their own will.</p>, <p>But it was merely a brief struggle.</p>, <p>Soon, the patterns were completely erased.</p>, <p>By the time the last tiny spark had vanished,</p>, <p>[You have defeated the ghouls lurking in the basement, the conspiracy, and a priest of the Demonic Cult. It was a long, long fight? You made great sacrifices and overcame your fears?

            "[<p>“Why did a female employee end up here?”</p>, <p>It might be part of an apartment complex, but in the end, this place is a construction site.</p>, <p>Why would a regular female employee wander around a construction site only to be kidnapped by ghouls?</p>, <p>The bodies gathered here belong to workers, construction managers, and a few security team members present at the onset of the ghoul incident.</p>, <p>Isn’t it odd for a petite woman in a suit to be among them?</p>, <p>And the most conclusive evidence is Kwak Dae-yong’s reaction.</p>, <p>If she was just another female employee in the first place, Kwak Dae-yong, who is deeply involved in the fieldwork, wouldn’t remember her name and face.</p>, <p>“Seon-bin-ssi is… um… Director Moon Seung-hee’s…”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong hesitated and he looked to be somewhat troubled.</p>, <p>“What is it? Her girlfriend?”</p>, <p>“…She’s Director Moon Seung-hee’s future strategy advisor.”</p>, <p>“Ah.”</p>, <p>The term “future strategy advisor” is a kind of slang.</p>, <p>Originally, it was a title reserved for more realistic and professional individuals, but in Paju, it carried a slightly different connotation.</p>, <p>It was used to refer to those who could predict the future and prevent supernatural events…</p>, <p>In other words, it meant mages or shamans.

Make sure to explain things well to Tudor.”</p>, <p>“Sure. I hope we can meet again.”</p>, <p>Meeting me again means that something bad will happen that they won’t be able to resolve on their own, yet he could say it so casually.</p>, <p>I haven’t decided on the mid-to-late half development yet, but if I choose a route related to Moon Seung-hee, I will end up meeting Kwak Dae-yong on a disturbingly frequent basis.</p>, <p>Otherwise… who knows?</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong’s team was such a ragtag group that calling them a corporate team was an overstatement.</p>, <p>If it weren’t for Moon Seung-hee, there would likely be no reason to meet them again.</p>, <p>Feeling no need to share such thoughts with him, I opted for a non-committal response.</p>, <p>“Well, if the timing and money are right, perhaps we’ll see each other.”</p>, <p>Kwak Dae-yong gave a bitter smile, bid farewell, and then headed back to where his subordinates were.</p>, <p>Is it finally time for me to head home as well?</p>, <p>I climbed the stairs and emerged onto the ground level.</p>, <p>It was still dark outside.</p>, <p>There was a brief commotion when some of the security team members guarding the area saw me, or more precisely, my mask, and screamed… Fortunately, it didn’t escalate into a major issue.</p>, <p>“Is this mask really the problem…?”</p>, <p>But it wasn’t just the mask; my overall appearance was a mess.</p>, <p>My clothes and body were covered in ghoul blood, dust, and soot.</p>, <p>Even without the mask, my appearance would be quite terrifying to stumble upon in the dead of night.</p>, <p>“Ah well… At least it’s fortunate that my hoodie is black.”</p>, <p>At this stage, wearing this mask seemed unavoidable, but once I leveled up, just one more level to access second-order magic… I could potentially cast an illusion to overlay a more acceptable face over the mask.</p>, <p>From that point on, I would be able to move around more comfortably.</p>, <p>Anyway, I need to contact Tudor.</p>, <p>The time was… now 4 a.m.</p>, <p>Despite the late hour, Tudor answered the phone as if it were nothing out of the ordinary.</p>, <p>[Oh, dear. Have you finished your work? It’s later than I expected.]</p>, <p>“I ran into quite a few unexpected issues.”</p>, <p>[Hehe… But you managed to handle everything, right?]</p>, <p>“Well, there shouldn’t be anyone left to complain. Get the details from the people at Yeonam Construction, and if there are no issues, proceed with the settlement.”</p>, <p>[Hmm, knowing you, you must have taken good care of it. Don’t worry about what the client says; I’ll make sure the settlement is handled properly. Drop by when you can.]</p>, <p>“Then… I’d like to rest a bit, so I’ll stop by next week.”</p>, <p>[Great! Shall I prepare a celebration party?]</p>, <p>“…No need. Just arrange the transportation as we discussed earlier.”</p>, <p>[Got it. I’ll call it right away, so just wait a bit. As I mentioned before, with the foreigner management office being so vigilant, try not to move around carelessly and use the secure taxis for now.]</p>, <p>“Hmm… those secure taxis are expensive…”</p>, <p>[Oh, dear? Didn’t I tell you about the kind of people at the foreigner management office earlier?]</p>, <p>“I might as well just stay cooped up in my room for a while.”</p>, <p>[Yes, that might actually be better. If you need it, I’ll send a taxi for you.]</p>, <p>“Alright. I’m tired anyway, so please hurry up and call me something. I want to go in and sleep.”</p>, <p>Tudor must have found something funny in what I said and she chuckled for a good while before hanging up.</p>, <p>Secure taxis are typically used by criminals making escapes, smugglers, or fixers heading to engage in dirty activities.</p>, <p>They offer impeccable security and services above and beyond, but naturally, at an exorbitant price.</p>, <p><em>Well, since Tudor is footing the bill today, I might as well use it…</em></p>, <p>The distance from here to the Geumchon neighborhood isn’t really that far, to begin with.</p>, <p>I thought it a hassle to use one when I came here….. but without a secure taxi now, I might risk getting arrested by the police on my way back.</p>, <p>As I was mulling over these thoughts, a white call van pulled up before long.</p>, <p><em>It came sooner than I expected.</em></p>, <p>An eye-catching name was emblazoned on the side of the vehicle.</p>, <p>[Fast Call Van]</p>, <p>The window of the call van slowly rolled down, and the driver who was seated at the wheel, greeted me with a cheerful voice.</p>, <p>“Yoohoo, hello there!”</p>, <p>The driver who had brought me was a rugged and scarred man who looked like he was a retired fixer, but this time it was a young punk… no, a handsome blond young man.</p>, <p>The initial impression of him being a punk wasn’t for nothing though.</p>, <p>He dyed his hair blonde and had eight large and small piercings on both sides of his ears.</p>, <p>And there he was, blinking his large eyes with a look of confusion on his face.</p>, <p>From inside the car window, I could see his broad shoulders and long limbs.</p>, <p>“Do you have any luggage?”</p>, <p>“No, none.”</p>, <p>“Okay, then in the back… Ah, you startled me! What’s with that face!?”</p>, <p>It seemed he had just noticed my mask and he let out a startled cry.</p>, <p>“…….”</p>, <p>“Oh, I won’t ask. I’m fine! Even if I look like this, I’m quite good at keeping secrets!”</p>, <p>“It’s a mask.”</p>, <p>“Oh, I see! It’s a mask! That’s a relief. Please, get in!”</p>, <p>I wasn’t sure what he found relieving, but I decided to let it go and was about to sit in the backseat when…</p>, <p>“Just a moment.”</p>, <p>It wasn’t something I realized after much thought. Just seeing the clean seat covers in the back of the car made me realize how dirty my clothes were.</p>, <p><em>Well, it’s not a big deal.</em></p>, <p>I lightly shook off my body and gathered my magical power.</p>, <p>[Purification]</p>, <p><em>Kiiiiiiiiin…!</em></p>, <p>As my palm brushed against my clothes, bursts of light emanated from both the fabric and my skin, drawing out the dust, stains, and copious amounts of blood that were clinging to my garment before gathering them at my fingertips.</p>, <p>“I really did get covered in a lot of blood.”</p>, <p>I then tossed the gathered filth onto the ground and climbed into the car.</p>, <p>As soon as I settled into the backseat, the driver turned to me and asked,</p>, <p>“Um, sir, what was that you just did? Could it be, I mean, is your profession by any chance…”</p>, <p>“What? Didn’t Tudor tell you?”</p>, <p>“Only that you’re an extremely capable and bloody fixer…”</p>, <p>What’s so bloody about me…</p>, <p>“It’s magic.”</p>, <p>“Wow! I had a feeling! That’s the first time I’ve ever witnessed real magic! You’re actually the first genuine mage I’ve had the chance to work with. I’ve had a psychic in the car before, but an actual mage? This is truly a first-time experience for me!”</p>, <p>The young driver began to chatter excitedly. Sensing he might go on endlessly if left unchecked, I tactfully cut him off.</p>, <p>“Shall we get going then?”</p>, <p>“Oh, yes. Departing now… You’re heading to the Geumchon neighborhood, right?”</p>, <p>“That’s right.”</p>, <p>“I’ve heard a bit, but it’s just a simple security transport, correct? Any changes I should be aware of?”</p>, <p>“No need to worry about being followed or anything. Just drive comfortably.”</p>, <p>“Got it!”</p>, <p>With that, the car started moving.</p>, <p>The young driver seemed preoccupied with the fact that I was a mage and he was frequently glancing at me through the rearview mirror with a jittery demeanor as he drove. Was it my face he was looking at or the mask? Anyway, I wish he would just focus on the road ahead…</p>, <p>Despite the driver’s less than professional conduct, the car moved smoothly along.</p>, <p>I ignored his gaze and got lost in thought.</p>, <p>I hoped that, in time, I would get another chance to see Moon Seung-hee’s face.</p>, <p>I was curious about how rescuing the NPC named Lee Seon-bin could change my relationship with Moon Seung-hee and the unfolding events in the Cthulhu world ahead.</p>, <p><em>Was it all meaningless? That woman seemed utterly lost to madness anyway.</em></p>, <p>And what should I do if a similar situation arises again?</p>, <p>Is it alright to drastically twist the game’s story?</p>, <p>Would it be better to just let things proceed as I know they will?</p>, <p>I took a moment to gaze out at the night view of Paju city flowing past the car window.</p>, <p>At first glance, it seemed similar to the real world I lived in, yet it was an entirely different city.</p>, <p>The Paju I knew didn’t have such bustling nightscapes, skyscrapers, or lawless individuals with supernatural powers.</p>, <p><em>Tsk, it’s all getting twisted anyway…</em></p>, <p>It’s better to take action than to just sit idly by.</p>, <p>All of the endings created by this game’s crazy developer are the worst and most disastrous endings.</p>, <p>Following the game’s current route would only lead to an endless battle with surreal monsters and a horrific demise.</p>, <p>I needed to somehow shake up the game’s narrative to escape this world.</p>, <p>I made up my mind and once again looked ahead.</p>, <p><em>But… why does that guy keep doing that?</em></p>, <p>The driver was still flinching and glancing my way.</p>, <p>No, not at me exactly… Something was off.</p>, <p>I deliberately ignored his wary glances for a while, and then, at an opportune moment, I initiated a conversation.</p>, <p>“What are you curious about?”</p>, <p>“Eh? Yes? Oh? Me? No?”</p>, <p>“If you’re not curious, then why do you keep looking?”</p>, <p>“Ah, how did you know?”</p>, <p>To think he was so surprised… Did he really think he wouldn’t get caught? However, I decided to give him the response he might have been hoping for.</p>, <p>“Because I’m a mage.”</p>, <p>“Ooooh…!”</p>, <p>He gasped for air. Somehow, this was amusing. When I was playing [Cthulhu World] as a game, I never had the chance to interact with NPCs like this.</p>, <p>It’s not like there weren’t NPCs with the driving expert tag that are given scripts as events, and these NPCs are directly linked to quests or events.</p>, <p>But in this world, unlike the game, every NPC or rather, every person is alive. And each had their own thoughts and individuality.</p>, <p>“So, what are you curious about?”</p>, <p>“Well, it’s not so much out of curiosity, but…”</p>, <p>He paused for a moment before continuing.</p>, <p>“That mask you’re wearing. Where did you get it?”</p>, <p>“Mask?”</p>, <p>My hand unconsciously went up to touch the mask covering my face, Carcosa’s Mask.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>[Carcosa’s Mask (L-Class Accessory): Once used by the Great Old Ruler, He Who Must Not Be Named, the mighty [King in Yellow]. Those not of equal status cannot fully harness its power.</p>, <p>Yellow Sign: The mighty [King in Yellow] takes an interest in you.</p>, <p>He wasn’t merely observing me all this time; he had been examining my mask.</p>, <p>Before this mask was an artifact with useful capability, it was an object connected to a mythical being. Among such items, there are those that can seduce or control the minds of those around them, endangering the owner or even replacing them.</p>, <p>That’s why I raised my magical power and answered.</p>, <p><strong>“Showing undue interest in a mage’s possession won’t bode well for you…”</strong></p>, <p>The heightened magical power formed a formidable aura of intimidation and was able to induce enough force to cause the smoothly running vehicle to noticeably shake.</p>, <p>The driver said with a pale expression on his face.</p>, <p>“Ahhh… It’s not that, not that, not that at all! I mentioned it because I’ve seen something similar before! Please, spare me!”</p>, <p>I realized I might have misunderstood something.</p>, <p>“Where?”</p>, <p>“Huh? Wh-what?”</p>, <p>The terrified driver stammered out a response.</p>, <p><strong>“When and where did you see such a mask?”</strong></p>, <p>I spoke slowly and emphasized each word. The rumbling sound of my heightened magical power resonated around me.</p>, <p>If he had seen it around the Geumchon neighborhood market or in the vicinity of that pawnshop, that could be plausible. It would mean he had seen it before I bought it.</p>, <p>“It was, it was… in Tanhyeon!”</p>, <p>“Tanhyeon?”</p>, <p>“Yes, Tanhyeon! You know Tanhyeon, right? I saw it at a strange archaeological site there! It was not long ago… it should still be there!”</p>, <p>What kind of development was this…?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The incident at Yeonam Construction’s apartment complex had left great aftereffects on my body for the first time in a while.</p>, <p>I hadn’t been directly attacked or injured.</p>, <p>The aftereffects were merely from running around late into the night using magic and from the continuous battles where life and death were decided in fractions of a second.</p>, <p>“I’m so… tired…”</p>, <p>Damn it. This was just exhaustion.</p>, <p>Though I could maintain the strength and health of an average person by heavily equipping artifacts, that was merely a facade maintained only while the artifacts were equipped.</p>, <p>I could manage to wear the ring that boosts my strength 24 hours a day, but the gloves that provide health bonus weren’t that comfortable.</p>, <p>I tried to wear them as long as possible, but these gloves were essentially motorcycle gloves, reinforced with various materials at the fingers. It’s not feasible to wear them all the time.</p>, <p>What am I trying to say?</p>, <p>Three days had passed since that night’s quest and yet I was still lying in bed.</p>, <p>Shit… I’m miserably exhausted.</p>, <p>Despite having spent the last two days doing nothing but lying down in preparation for today, my body still refused to cooperate.</p>, <p>I barely managed to turn my head to look out the window.</p>, <p>While I wasn’t in the worst state imaginable, unable to move my neck emotionally, it felt just as draining.</p>, <p>What time is it now…?</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>Lacking the energy to move, I gathered my magical power to pick up my smartphone.</p>, <p>“Ah, damn it. It’s already 7 o’clock?”</p>, <p>It was 7 p.m, not a.m.</p>, <p>It was definitely 3 p.m right after I had woken up, which meant I had spent another four hours doing absolutely nothing. It was high time I got up and grabbed something to eat.</p>, <p>Hold on. There’s an alarm asking for confirmation on the monotonous default screen of my smartphone.</p>, <p>I never bothered downloading any messaging apps or the like; it’s too much of a hassle. If someone wants to contact me, they have to either call or send a text message.</p>, <p>The inbox was filled with messages from Tudor.</p>, <p>[Here’s the personal information for Lee Seon-bin you requested. Check the attached file for details.]</p>, <p>I had asked about this over the phone just yesterday. It’s nice to have it confirmed in just a day.</p>, <p>I opened the attached file and quickly skimmed through the contents.</p>, <p>As expected, Lee Seon-bin was a second-tier mage, and although she was officially a freelancer, she mainly worked with Yeonam Group. It seems she became a “future strategy advisor” for Yeonam when Moon Seung-hee moved to Yeonam Construction.</p>, <p>Apart from a note at the bottom of the document stating “Closely acquainted with Moon Seung-hee and presumed to be a confidant of her” there was nothing else of importance.</p>, <p>[She’s currently at Paju Central Hospital. She hasn’t been admitted for long, so it’s hard to get the specifics, but it seems she’s in the psychiatric ward. Her condition is quite bad, so all visits are prohibited for the time being.]</p>, <p>[Apparently, she’s had several seizures since being admitted, and she’s a mage right? She must have had a magical accident.]</p>, <p>A magical accident… It was a type of disaster that could never occur in the reality where I used to live. It refers to incidents caused by a deranged mage recklessly unleashing spells.</p>, <p>[It seems Yeonam Construction was quite fond of her, right? If you want to meet Lee Seon-bin, just let me know. I can arrange it anytime. Of course, it’s not 100% guaranteed, especially since visits are currently prohibited.]</p>, <p>[If it were me, I wouldn’t take the risk of meeting a mage with a mental illness.]</p>, <p>“Maybe I’m crazy enough myself to handle it.”</p>, <p>That said, I have no immediate plans to meet Lee Seon-bin.</p>, <p>I was curious to verify some of the nonsensical mutterings from last time, but I already had plans for today.</p>, <p>“I don’t know what event is waiting for me, but I hope it involves a level-up.”</p>, <p>It’s about time for Tudor to start offering some real quests.</p>, <p>To prepare for that, I want to reach level 20 before the next quest begins.</p>, <p>As my thoughts drifted from today’s commitments to the upcoming quest, I felt the determination to get up. I used the magical telekinesis I activated earlier to casually toss my smartphone aside and picked up the gloves I had carelessly thrown under the bed.</p>, <p>As soon as I donned the gloves, I could feel vitality returning to my body.</p>, <p>“Phew… it really does make a difference.”</p>, <p>While other artifacts have their merits, few offer a straightforward boost of +2 to health without any strings attached.</p>, <p>Having managed to get up, I quickly tidied up the area and then grabbed three dumplings from the fridge and popped them in the microwave.</p>, <p><em>Ding!</em></p>, <p>The dumplings came out of the microwave emitting clouds of white steam. I had slightly moistened them with water before microwaving them, but the surface was still a little hard. Starting tomorrow, I’ll have to eat proper food even if it’s a bit annoying.</p>, <p>I slightly lifted the mask covering my face and shoved a dumpling into my mouth.</p>, <p>Although not quite the same as when freshly made, the reheated dumpling was still satisfyingly delicious. Ah, hot… this place really does make them well.</p>, <p>While eating the dumplings, I looked around the room and cast a few security spells.</p>, <p>[Warning Bell], [Thorn Trap], [Kanotodoa’s Severance], [Ra’s Golden Sand], and [Realm of Darkness].</p>, <p>A haze begins to billow around the window.</p>, <p>Should anyone dare to enter without permission, I would instantly be alarmed and they would find themselves struck with a status ailment that robs them of their sight, hearing, and even their ability to speak.</p>, <p>And then, with dozens of magical blades embedded in their body, they would succumb to an overpowering sleep that they wouldn’t be able to resist.</p>, <p>Is this sufficient? Perhaps a few more bolts of lightning spell should be set in place.</p>, <p>“Alright, that concludes the preparations for going out.”</p>, <p>In the mirror next to the shoe rack, the reflection of a crazy-looking mage donning a hoodie instead of the usual dark robe, with a bizarre mask covering his face, was visible.</p>, <p>Is that really me? It’s been over a month since I last saw my own face. Perhaps beneath this mask lies not the face of Kim Shin-hwa that I remember, but something monstrous that I could never have imagined.</p>, <p>Well, it doesn’t matter. I have an appointment today.</p>, <p>The security taxi driver I met three days ago.</p>, <p>I was scheduled to meet him again.</p>, <p>I grabbed my skateboard and backpack, slinging it over my shoulder as I stepped out of the apartment.</p>, <p>As always, my destination wasn’t the ground floor, but the rooftop.</p>, <p>The day was gradually turning to dusk.</p>, <p>It was now 8 p.m.</p>, <p>When I surveyed the surroundings from the rooftop, the dilapidated buildings of the Geumchon neighborhood were bathed in an ominous purplish color.</p>, <p>In the distance, surreal skyscrapers towered impossibly high, and on one corner of my view, a huge brass Buddha statue sat atop the Hwangnyeongsan Mountain Forest Park.</p>, <p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s a strange sight…”</p>, <p>The landscape of Paju was unreal and such sights exist only in [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>The time for the upright and sane citizens of Paju had come to an end, and the era of the deranged criminals was about to begin.</p>, <p>I got on my skateboard and activated a spell.</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>A dazzling magic circle unfurled on the black hoodie I was wearing, propelling the skateboard into the sky.</p>, <p>The whooshing of the wind grazed my ears as the scenery before my eyes changed rapidly, several times over.</p>, <p>After leaping and leaping again, bypassing a few buildings, I finally managed to land by the roadside.</p>, <p>I was now enough away from home and I didn’t need to use any more magic.</p>, <p>I casually rolled the skateboard before slowly making my way to the rendezvous.</p>, <p>“Yoohoo, hello there!”</p>, <p>A cheerful greeting.</p>, <p>I looked in the direction of the greeting, which was identical to the one I had heard three days ago.</p>, <p>This punk who just greeted me…. I meant this handsome young man in his early twenties casually flicked off his cigarette.</p>, <p>His height was roughly 185 cm? He was about half a span taller than me and had strong muscles all over his body.</p>, <p>At first glance, he looked more of a nosy guy than a sincere guy, but the well-defined and harmonious features of his face instilled an unwarranted sense of familiarity.</p>, <p>His charm must be at least a 19. While not transcendently handsome like a Tudor, his good looks were enough to ensure survival on the streets even in the direst of circumstances.</p>, <p>“Uwah, you’re wearing that mask again today?”</p>, <p>“It’s cursed, so I have to keep wearing it.”</p>, <p>“A-A curse, you say?”</p>, <p>“Don’t worry, it’s not contagious.”</p>, <p>“Um… are you sure?”</p>, <p>“Absolutely.”</p>, <p>The name of this young carrier was Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>Although we had only met in person three days ago, he wasn’t a complete stranger to me.</p>, <p>Back when I played [Cthulhu World] as a game, I had ridden in his car a few times.</p>, <p>But that was the extent of it.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok wasn’t an NPC with important quests or special options attached, nor was he a character whose name one would remember.</p>, <p>Had I not possessed an abnormally high level of intelligence stat, recalling him would have been impossible.</p>, <p>Nonetheless, for a mass-produced NPC of little importance, I had thought his design was overly elaborate for no reason… only to discover there was a hidden event involved.</p>, <p>“It doesn’t matter what happens to my mask. Did you bring what you mentioned?”</p>, <p>“Ah, of course. But…”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok slightly hunched his body and glanced around as if surveying the surroundings, then whispered with an exaggeratedly dramatic expression.</p>, <p>“Let’s not show it here. How about we go to the car?”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok gestured with his thumb over his shoulder.</p>, <p>There lay his vehicle, a large white SUV call van.</p>, <p>Three days ago, Jang Hyeon-deok claimed to have seen a mask identical to mine and claimed that he had proof of that as well.</p>, <p>While I was eager to check immediately, I had honestly never encountered such a situation in the game before, so I wanted to proceed when my stamina was at least a little recovered.</p>, <p>Thus, it was today, three days later, that I found myself meeting him again.</p>, <p>With a slight sigh, I climbed into the car alongside him.</p>, <p>“Now, let’s see it. If you start talking nonsense at this point, I’ll be terribly disappointed.”</p>, <p>And that disappointment might compel me to make those around me uncomfortable. However, there was no need for this unspoken threat to materialize.</p>, <p>The item Jang Hyeon-deok proudly produced certainly lived up to my expectations.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“Here it is.”</p>, <p>What was in Jang Hyeon-deok’s hand was a worn mask. Or to be exact, a fragment of a shattered mask.</p>, <p>“Look. It’s quite similar to the one Mage-nim is wearing, isn’t it?”</p>, <p>“Indeed.”</p>, <p>To reiterate, this was a fragment of a mask. The chin part is missing, and the forehead part is cracked, leaving only just enough to cover near the eyes, and these eyes are quite unique.</p>, <p>“Four eyes, I see.”</p>, <p>Even without its distinctive appearance, there are other ways to tell that this item is not mere trash.</p>, <p>[Damaged Mask (Junk) – Part of a certain mask.</p>, <p>Research or appraisal is necessary to identify it.]</p>, <p>Not just any item triggers a message window. If that were the case, even the dumplings I ate today would have displayed something. It must hold some special secret.</p>, <p>“Let me see it.”</p>, <p>“You have to give it back!”</p>, <p>“Understood.”</p>, <p>After being reassured multiple times, Jang Hyeon-deok finally handed over the mask.</p>, <p>“Hmm….”</p>, <p>I turned the mask fragment over and examined it closely. It was a faded gray, almost tinged with blue but it must have originally been white.</p>, <p><em>The remnants of magical power are still present, but it’s so deteriorated that it’s hard to make anything out of it.</em></p>, <p>I struggled to appraise Carcosa’s Mask that I was currently wearing, but it seemed that appraising something as damaged as this might actually be easier.</p>, <p>[Identification]</p>, <p>When I activated a first-order appraisal spell, a dry sound effect accompanied a burst of light.</p>, <p>[System: Unveiling the veil surrounding the ‘Damaged Mask.’]</p>, <p>[Unveiling Judgment in Progress…]</p>, <p>Beyond the fragment of the mask, I could see Jang Hyeon-deok’s face.</p>, <p>The fluorescent glow emanating from the mask and the purple dusk falling from the sky intertwined, creating an indescribable and bizarre color that made his handsome face appear as if it belonged to an ominous mythical being from the abyss.</p>, <p><em>Kiiiiing…</em></p>, <p>[Judgment successful.]</p>, <p>The appraisal was unexpectedly successful.</p>, <p>At the same time, new information appeared in the message window.</p>, <p>[Carcosa’s Mask: Damaged (Junk) – Although it is now completely destroyed and has lost its power, this object once contained the power of the Great Old Ruler, He Who Must Not Be Named, the mighty [King in Yellow].]</p>, <p>“Holy sh*t, it’s real.”</p>, <p>“I told you, didn’t I? I told you, there are many more things just like this in Tanhyeon!”</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Tanhyeon is a neighborhood located northwest of Geumchon neighborhood, and speaking from the perspective of the real world I inhabited, it is one of Paju’s tourist attractions.</p>, <p>It houses the Heyri Art Village, a folk museum, and a decent-sized theme park, and it’s also home to one of only two Unification Observatories in South Korea.</p>, <p>Since I have lived in Paju in the original world, I have visited Tanhyeon a few times in reality.</p>, <p>To be honest, the atmosphere of Tanhyeon was closer to the countryside than a tourist destination.</p>, <p>The landscape was a monotonous repetition of forests, mountains, and factories punctuated occasionally by tourist spots, with the Imjin River flowing alongside the road, and beyond it, the land of North Korea in view.</p>, <p>However, in [Cthulhu World], Tanhyeon held a special significance.</p>, <p>Similar to the issues with the apartment complex in Munsan by Yeonam Construction I had visited before, being close to North Korea in [Cthulhu World] meant that the area was synonymous with danger.</p>, <p>Therefore, in the world of [Cthulhu World], Tanhyeon had become a sort of high-level area and none of its tourist attractions were operational anymore.</p>, <p>Instead, there were only areas overrun by outlaws, restricted zones created by surreal disasters, and slums inhabited by bizarre individuals.</p>, <p>In such an absurd place, Jang Hyeon-deok cheerfully made idle conversation as he drove.</p>, <p>“Though the atmosphere here has turned a bit strange now, it used to be a beautiful region and quite the decent tourist destination. Do you see that ruin in the distance? That’s the Heyri Art Village. Oh, and did you know there’s a legend about beautiful celestial maidens who descended to dance at a pond somewhere around here?”</p>, <p>“How can you still find beauty in a place like this?”</p>, <p>“Well, it does look a bit different now, doesn’t it?”</p>, <p>As people stopped visiting, the landscape of Tanhyeon completely transformed.</p>, <p>Even the air outside the window seemed to have changed. Although we were moving away from the city’s outskirts and approaching nature, the nature here was not the clear and verdant type one would expect</p>, <p>The trees that pierced the streets and buildings, perhaps drinking water that had poured in from the North Korean side, grew in strange, twisted shapes, unfurling leaves of a strange, ashy brown color that was neither green nor yellow.</p>, <p>Trees and stones, and then trees again, everything that caught the eye seemed twisted and contorted as if suffering from some disease. Amid such twisted shadows, one could even fall under the illusion of seeing something move, something that was neither human nor beast.</p>, <p>These ominous woods formed dense forests, and beyond lay mountains upon mountains with the Imjin River visible alongside the road, and further still, the land of North Korea, which one should never gaze upon for too long.</p>, <p>It wasn’t the kind of place where bandits or goblins might suddenly block your path, yet it was a place where no decent citizen living in the bright hours of Paju would ever visit.</p>, <p>A considerable amount of time had passed since we had left the Geumchon neighborhood. This area was among the deepest parts of Tanhyeon.</p>, <p>“We’re getting into the real heart of Tanhyeon now. You’re sure you know what you’re getting into, right? I can’t be responsible for you from here on.”</p>, <p>“Ah, of course. It’s not my first time here. I’ve carried around professionals like Mage-nim through here more times than I can count.”</p>, <p>“So how much further do we have to go?”</p>, <p>“We’re almost there. About… 5 minutes? No, maybe 10 minutes?”</p>, <p>As I pondered the cost of calling another secure taxi in Tanhyeon, I spoke to Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>“Alright, I’ll trust you then.”</p>, <p>“Huh? Were you doubting me?”</p>, <p>“No one trusts anyone they meet in Paju after dark.”</p>, <p>“That’s harsh… I came all this way trusting Mage-nim. That’s too bad.”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok spoke with a tone of disappointment, but his face was filled with a smile.</p>, <p>From the beginning, ours was not a relationship where notions like loyalty or trust were relevant.</p>, <p>The moment I verified that the fragment of the mask he brought was genuine, Jang Hyeon-deok demanded a fee for the information. After a long and tedious argument, we were able to reach the following agreement:</p>, <p>“So, for the information fee, 2 million, for the fare to get there, 3 million, and any treasures or artifacts we find must be split exactly 50/50.”</p>, <p>Once we entered the interior of Tanhyeon, our speed drastically decreased. Roads neglected and eroded were the least of our worries.</p>, <p>There were times when large trees or deformed animal corpses blocked the road, and there were times when we had to push through bushes where there was no road at all.</p>, <p>As a result, the car didn’t just shake; it jolted forward almost as if it were a ship caught in a storm. I had to spread my magical power to stabilize my metabolism to avoid getting motion sick.</p>, <p>After a while, Jang Hyeon-deok fell silent. When I glanced at the side of his face, I saw him muttering and counting numbers under his breath.</p>, <p>“Six, seven. Then there’s a landmark, and after that, two, three.”</p>, <p>He was navigating without a GPS. He was memorizing the route based on the trees and rocks that grew by the roadside.</p>, <p>The complexity of the path required such concentration that it left no room for conversation.</p>, <p>After repeatedly forging through areas off the beaten path, the car finally came to a stop.</p>, <p>“We’re here! It’s just over there!”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok raised a hand to point between two trees to a certain spot.</p>, <p>“Just trees?”</p>, <p>“Well, it’s not very visible from here. We can’t go any further by car, so we’ll have to walk a bit from here.”</p>, <p>“Are we going hiking…?”</p>, <p>“No, it’s not that serious… just past that tree and we’re there.”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok got out of the car. It was difficult for me to get out of the car because I was still suffering from the throbbing pain of the vibration that seemed to be going up to the top of my head, but I gritted my teeth and got out.</p>, <p>If only my health were a bit better, this might have been easier… but I guess I can’t improve it here and now.</p>, <p>Just like Jang Hyeon-deok said, the destination didn’t seem far. Ahead, I could sense an unpleasant magical power pooling in a way that was hard to detect elsewhere.</p>, <p>I did some light stretching to straighten my back and activated my spells.</p>, <p>[Trap Detection]</p>, <p>[Magic Detection]</p>, <p>[Invisibility Detection]</p>, <p>Aside from the unnatural gathering of magical power, no particular dangers were detected.</p>, <p>In the meantime, Jang Hyeon-deok was sneakily moving ahead.</p>, <p>“Hey, Jang Hyeon-deok. Wait for me.”</p>, <p>“Ah, yes. Please hurry. It’s right here.”</p>, <p>“Slow down a bit.”</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Distortion Field]</p>, <p>[Mountain Goat’s Step]</p>, <p>To be honest, my condition wasn’t very good because I hadn’t fully recovered from the aftereffects of the quest I had undertaken three days prior. As a result, I had to activate not only basic defensive spells but also supplementary magic to bolster my stamina.</p>, <p><em>Maintaining a high number of spells at the same time isn’t ideal.</em></p>, <p>No matter how vast one’s magical power pool might be, there is no benefit in maintaining multiple spells at the same time. There’s the issue of each spell’s power and precision diminishing, and maintaining focus also becomes increasingly taxing.</p>, <p>Apart from the drain of spellcasting, the surrounding environment was sapping my concentration.</p>, <p>First, there was the strange fishy smell emanating from the trees. It was different from the typical musty scent of the forest and more akin to the smell of sewage stagnating in a sewer. Then there were the bizarre insects with grotesque forms hanging from the trees. Bugs with spiny shells or patterns resembling human faces, scurrying around on eight or nine legs.</p>, <p>“Nothing here seems normal.”</p>, <p>The fact that this place was unfamiliar territory also unnerved me. While I’ve encountered deviations from expected scenarios before, none were to this extent. I’m familiar with the worlds both outside and inside the game, yet I had never visited such a place.</p>, <p>Suddenly, I realized that I had arrived at the very spot Jang Hyeon-deok had mentioned.</p>, <p>“What is that…?”</p>, <p>It was a landscape unlike any I had ever seen before.</p>, <p>The forest, dense with trees upon trees, abruptly gave way to an excessively wide clearing.</p>, <p>And within this clearing were what appeared to be hundreds of rocks placed at intervals.</p>, <p>Although they were made of stone and thus referred to as rocks, I questioned whether it was appropriate to call them such.</p>, <p>These rocks had a bizarre lifelike shape as if they had sprouted from the ground instead of trees, and there was a disturbing malevolence about them that seemed to defy the idea they were formed naturally.</p>, <p>Even thinking such thoughts soured my mood, but these formations were roughly the size of a human and bore a vaguely human shape.</p>, <p>It was as if… as if…</p>, <p>[The ruins spread out before your eyes are eerily quiet. The usual sounds of insects and birds that tickled your ears until now are absent in this land of silence. It is a barren land where not a single tree or flower can bloom.</p>, <p>Across the vast landscape, bizarre stone pillars stand endlessly, their ominous shapes seemingly beyond description. As if humans writhing in agony and pleading with a cruel deity have been petrified in their distress.</p>, <p>Everything in sight appears as if it was crafted by an artist possessed by a dynamic and destructive madness, resulting in a horrifying and blasphemous spectacle.]</p>, <p>[The ominous silence and malevolent aura that hovers in this space have a negative impact on your psyche.]</p>, <p>[System: Attempting to resist the malevolent influence with your mental strength.

            "[<p>It was eerily quiet. So quiet that one could be startled by their own voice. The silence was filled with human-shaped rocks.</p>, <p>Though there was no sound, I felt like I was hearing hallucinations of hundreds of people shouting at the same time from somewhere.</p>, <p>Although the appearance of Tanhyeon has changed a lot in the world of [Cthulhu World], there has never been a place like this in the game before.</p>, <p>The magical power that I sensed earlier was concentrated further inside the wasteland, probably about 60 meters away by foot.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok spoke with a flushed expression on his face.</p>, <p>“How about it? Do you see them over there?”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>“The masks, I mean the masks. Look, there on the ground!”</p>, <p>Beneath the human-like stone pillars, fragments of the mask that Jang Hyeon-deok had pointed out were scattered.</p>, <p>The sight of mask pieces endlessly spread out under hundreds of pillars was strangely unsettling.</p>, <p>It was as if…</p>, <p>“It seems like there are as many masks as there are pillars, don’t you think?”</p>, <p>“It seems so.”</p>, <p>“I had thought about picking up a few to sell at some point, but these fragments turned out to be worthless.”</p>, <p>I took a few steps forward and picked up a piece of a mask that had fallen to the ground to examine it.</p>, <p>It was just like the one Jang Hyeon-deok had shown me earlier, the kind of junk item that shops wouldn’t accept.</p>, <p>“These things scattered here have already lost their meaning. Even if you collect them all and take them away, you won’t make more than what you’d pay for labor.”</p>, <p>“Have you ever gone all the way inside?”</p>, <p>“Ah! Yes, I was just about to talk about that!”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok suddenly brightened up and pulled me toward him.</p>, <p>“Come this way, this way!”</p>, <p>It was already well into the evening, and darkness had set in.</p>, <p>We stood on the edge of a gloomy archaeological site where bizarre rocks were endlessly arranged.</p>, <p>Those rocks. They had an eerie shape that somehow resembled a human being, but like most of the mask fragments that had fallen to the ground, they were of little value now.</p>, <p>Although they bore traces of magical power, they had lost their value and had become mere background debris.</p>, <p>But further inside…</p>, <p>In the heart of this quiet and dark archaeological site, I could feel a sticky and ominous magical power.</p>, <p>I didn’t know whether this energy could be divided fifty-fifty, just as Jang Hyeon-deok hoped but it implied that there was something of value or significance here.</p>, <p>“Here, uh… just turn your head at this angle from this spot.”</p>, <p>When asked if he had ever approached the heart of the ruins, Jang Hyeon-deok pulled me over and made me stand at a specific angle.</p>, <p>Beyond the rocks and the darkness of the night… wait, hold on.</p>, <p>[Moonlight Vision]</p>, <p>[Eagle Eye]</p>, <p>Although I was still one level short of being able to use spells outside of the first-order, my extraordinary magical power which far surpassed that of a first-order mage, allowed me to freely cast auxiliary and enchantment spells.</p>, <p>I enchanted my eyes with two types of spells to improve my vision and pierced through the darkness that shrouded the archaeological site to see what Jang Hyeon-deok was pointing out.</p>, <p>“Indeed, I can see it.”</p>, <p>It was a scene only visible from this exact position. A gap that was formed accidentally between the bizarrely twisted rocks offered a glimpse into a deeper part of the archaeological site.</p>, <p>Inside, at the center of the archaeological site where magical power was concentrated, there stood rocks resembling humans just like in other areas.</p>, <p>However, these rocks were different.</p>, <p>On the upper part of these rocks, where a human’s face would be, there were masks in perfect condition.</p>, <p>Rocks wearing masks. There were roughly three of them visible from here.</p>, <p>“This place, this atmosphere, these, these, these things are arranged so exquisitely. There’s no way these masks are just some flimsy junk!”</p>, <p>“Hmm. It is indeed exquisitely arranged.”</p>, <p>It was truly exquisite. Excessively so, everything.</p>, <p>“Right? Oh…? Why are you looking at me like that?”</p>, <p>“What kind of look are you talking about when I’m wearing a mask?”</p>, <p>“No, but still, I have a feeling, you know?”</p>, <p>“Well, it is true that I’m looking at you with suspicion.”</p>, <p>“Ah, exactly! I knew it, didn’t I? No… that’s not it… um… why is that?”</p>, <p>“Well, I just had a feeling you might be a bit suspicious.”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok recoiled in surprise.</p>, <p>“You said you trusted me earlier?!”</p>, <p>“When did I say that? I said I don’t trust anyone.”</p>, <p>The reason Jang Hyeon-deok guided me here wasn’t because he trusted me but because of my money and the guarantee from Tudor, who was a well-known broker.</p>, <p>Likewise, I did not trust Jang Hyeon-deok either.</p>, <p>More specifically, should I say I did not trust the safety of this situation?</p>, <p>After all, how many things in this world can truly be trusted? Things I have seen with my own eyes? Tudor, who was programmed in the game to never betray the player?</p>, <p>From the moment this NPC appeared as if on cue, like a predestined event, I could not fully trust Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>“No, no! I’m for real, for real! It was Mage-nim who suggested coming here in the first place!”</p>, <p>“Who said you were fake? But besides that point,”</p>, <p>While Jang Hyeon-deok himself might be completely innocent, there could be a powerful entity behind him that orchestrated these events.</p>, <p>Despite such doubts, I followed his lead and came this far.</p>, <p>Partly because I was determined to follow a narrative that had never existed in the game…</p>, <p>And also because considering Jang Hyeon-deok’s stats and the capabilities he could muster, I calculated that I could easily subdue him should he betray me.</p>, <p>After that, Jang Hyeon-deok continued to ramble on, trying to prove his innocence and purity, but I only half-listened as I prepared to enter the ruins.</p>, <p>The protective circle and distortion field were already in place, but how many enchantments should I apply?</p>, <p>I had already cast five spells. Considering the spells required to respond to unexpected situations, casting more felt burdensome, yet I couldn’t just take it lightly.</p>, <p>Honestly, entering a place in [Cthulhu World] with so little prior information felt no different from walking into a nuclear power plant after a radiation leak.</p>, <p>Alien spores could be inhaled, leading to poisoning or the growth of alien plants in the lungs, and undetectable waves could disrupt brain activity, causing forced disorientation.</p>, <p>[Prayer of Protection]</p>, <p>[Gesture of Guardianship]</p>, <p>[Cat’s Reflexes]</p>, <p>Layering more spells on my body felt too burdensome, so I distributed some by attaching them to my clothes and the skateboard I carried on my back.</p>, <p>“Then, let’s go.”</p>, <p>“Ah, great! It’s time to leave.”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok started walking ahead with an excited expression on his face. Wait, what did he say?</p>, <p>“Hey, what?”</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>“Where are you going?”</p>, <p>“You said we’re going, didn’t you?”</p>, <p>“…You too?”</p>, <p>“Of course, right?”</p>, <p>I took a moment to look into Jang Hyeon-deok’s face and then into his eyes. His cheeks were flushed with excitement, and his pupils shone with an unwavering light. It was a look reminiscent of the most dangerous types of humans in [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>Fear exists as a defensive mechanism to protect the body. Those without it always cause huge problems. For a moment, I considered knocking him down but then I changed my mind.</p>, <p>“Forget it. Do as you please.”</p>, <p>“Yoohoo!”</p>, <p>Let’s see what awaits us then. I wasn’t sure who had set this up, but I decided to go along for the ride.</p>, <p>I split a few spells and cast them on Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>“Tsk, fine. Let’s go in then.”</p>, <p>“Let’s get moving!”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok turned and started to make his way between the rocks into the ruins, holding nothing but a flashlight in his hand. This crazy bastard…</p>, <p>[Dancing Flames]</p>, <p>A dazzling cluster of light flickered into existence and it blocked his path as if to stop him.</p>, <p>“Don’t mess around; just follow behind me slowly.”</p>, <p>“Ah, yes. I will.”</p>, <p>We slowly stepped into the ruins.</p>, <p>Although it was surrounded by a forest, the interior of the ruins was extremely dry.</p>, <p>There were no major issues yet. And if any arose, traits like [Enhanced Vigilance] or [Feast Offering] that activated on their own were still dormant, so it was fine.</p>, <p>With each step we took, the brittle ground crumbled 2 to 3 centimeters, accompanied by the clinking sound of fragments of masks scattered densely on the floor.</p>, <p>There are so many rocks, and with them, an enormous number of mask fragments as numerous as the rocks themselves.</p>, <p>It was like the scene of a mad artist’s frenzy who was destroying failed pieces until an impossible work of art was created.</p>, <p>Beyond the bizarre, surreal atmosphere and the physiological revulsion emanating from the human-like rocks, nothing specifically obstructed our path.</p>, <p>However, the presence of the atmosphere and the rocks created an unpleasant pressure that was more difficult than a physical barrier.</p>, <p>Therefore, despite the time spent moving, our progress was frustratingly slow.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, Jang Hyeon-deok looked like he was surrounded by monsters writhing in terrible agony, even though there was plenty of space between him and the rocks.</p>, <p>“Wow… Mage-nim, the further we go inside, the more sinister the atmosphere becomes.”</p>, <p>His attitude was strange. So it was unclear whether he found this situation good or bad.</p>, <p>The interior of the ruins was silent. That is, it was silent apart from the incessant chatter of Jang Hyeon-deok, who was the only other sound in the place.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok continued to prattle on with unnecessary stories as he followed behind me.</p>, <p>He talked about having younger siblings to support, being from an orphanage, how Mage-nim (that is me) seemed like an amazing and impressive person, how he thought I appeared kind, how he felt it was fate from the first moment he saw me, how he had always wanted to return to this place, how he had dreamed about this location numerous times since discovering it, his desperate need for money, how he had foolishly wasted his time on frivolous pursuits in the past, his plans to move abroad if he got more money because he was tired of Korea and found it a dreadful country, and so on and so forth…</p>, <p>Since there was no real need to focus on his rambling stories, I instead observed his behavior and everything else around us as we moved forward.</p>, <p>The air’s density, the flow of magical power, the smell, the light, the sounds.</p>, <p>It might just be needless worry, but this is no easy passage. Even removing elements like pressure and discomfort, this space has too many blind spots.</p>, <p>Wait a moment? Did I just gloss over something important?</p>, <p>I kept moving forward without stopping and spoke to Jang Hyeon-deok who was following behind me.</p>, <p>“Hey, Jang Hyeon-deok, what did you say earlier?”</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>“You mentioned something about a dream, right?”</p>, <p>“Oh, about wanting to live abroad? If I ever make it big, that is…”</p>, <p>“No, not that. You said you kept dreaming about this place?”</p>, <p>“Oh, yes, I did.”</p>, <p>A large rock, positioned as if with its arms outstretched, blocked our path. I instinctively turned to the right to avoid the rock and continued the conversation.</p>, <p>“What exactly did you dream about?”</p>, <p>“I first learned about this place when a fixer told me to come here.”</p>, <p>The direction of his voice was slightly off. Even though he was behind me…</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“I’ve wanted to come back ever since I found out that this place was created after the Great Collapse and was unknown to anyone.”</p>, <p>I glanced over my shoulder to look for Jang Hyeon-deok, but he was nowhere to be seen. However, his voice continued to reach me.</p>, <p>“This place has appeared in my dreams repeatedly. I saw beautiful celestial maidens dancing at the center of these endless ruins covered in rocks.”</p>, <p>When I turned right at the rock, Jang Hyeon-deok had turned left. This caused our paths to diverge and he was moving in a different direction from me.</p>, <p>“Could there be great treasures and rewards hidden here? I believe Mage-nim will fulfill my wishes.”</p>, <p>The rock obstructed our path. As I redirected my course, Jang Hyeon-deok’s voice somehow moved to be in front of me. There must have been another path on that side.</p>, <p>[System: The ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ trait has been activated.]</p>, <p>Holy shit.</p>, <p>Suddenly, my senses expanded and my already tense nerves became extremely sensitive.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim! Over there, look at those!”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok’s excited voice struck my ears. And thanks to the recently activated trait, he sounded even louder as if hammering on my eardrums. I subconsciously raised my hands to shield my ears while looking towards Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>“That son of a bit*h.”</p>, <p>Before we knew it, we had reached the deepest part of the ruins.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok had arrived at the spot before me, but he did not attack me or transform into a monster or anything of the sort.</p>, <p>Instead, with a face full of exhilaration and a splendid smile, he spread his arms wide and pointed towards something at the center of the ruins.</p>, <p>On this dark night.</p>, <p>In the middle of the deep forest of Tanhyeon, the only source of light in this dark archaeological site was the magical light dancing above my hand.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok’s face as he looked at me was bathed in strange colors from the light.</p>, <p>His expression was one of naive and blissful happiness, like a child leading their parents to a splendid festival.</p>, <p>In the direction he was pointing… there was something special in the midst of the surrounding rocks, something completely different from them.</p>, <p>Yes, something special.</p>, <p>The intact masks we checked before entering the ruins.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok believed that these masks would bring him sudden wealth and for some reason, he felt compelled to bring me here.</p>, <p>Then there was the fixer who had previously accompanied Jang Hyeon-deok to this place.</p>, <p>What had become of him? Jang Hyeon-deok seemed to be turning a blind eye to whatever had happened to him that day. However, if he had managed to return safely in one piece, these masks could not possibly still be here.</p>, <p><em>Well, it does seem like a classic setup, when you think about it.</em></p>, <p>Despite being so deeply buried and surrounded by numerous obstacles, those masks somehow remained visible even from a great distance outside.</p>, <p>Was it due to a perfect angle and a coincidence that they could be seen from afar?</p>, <p>Not at all.</p>, <p>It was just that they twisted the laws of physics themselves to dangle bait for unwitting prey to stumble upon.</p>, <p>I slightly turned my head to look past Jang Hyeon-deok at the row of rocks wearing masks.</p>, <p>The fact that they wore masks and that they still harbored magical power inside was not their only special feature.</p>, <p>Their forms were different from the others; they were perfect.</p>, <p>Perfectly human in shape.</p>, <p>The surfaces were smoothly polished and clean. It would almost be embarrassing to call them rocks. They seemed more like statues.</p>, <p>Compared to these statues, the rocks strewn around appeared like melting and decaying corpses.</p>, <p>Each statue was posed differently.</p>, <p>One had its arms spread towards the sky, another lifted a leg in a ballet pose, one was crouched, and another had its arms bent.</p>, <p>“Look. They almost seem… to be in the midst of a dance, don’t they?”</p>, <p>“Indeed, those are the poses of a dance.”</p>, <p>“The dance I saw in my dream looked exactly like this. There was this strange music and beautiful lights falling from the sky…”</p>, <p>A dance…</p>, <p>If one thought of it as a dance, then indeed, it could be seen as such.</p>, <p>And the number of statues wearing masks and dancing…</p>, <p>One, two, three.</p>, <p>Then over there, four, five, six.</p>, <p>And there as well. Seven, eight…</p>, <p>Wait!</p>, <p>Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait.</p>, <p>Wait a moment.</p>, <p>A chill ran through me as if I had been struck by lightning.</p>, <p>A sinister premonition brushed through my mind.</p>, <p>Of all the times, fu*k it.</p>, <p>And just my luck, Jang Hyeon-deok was doing the same thing. That crazy fool was counting out loud with a gleeful grin on his face!</p>, <p>“Nine, ten, eleven…”</p>, <p>“Heey, stop it.”</p>, <p>Was that really my voice? It trembled excessively.</p>, <p>“Huh? There’s more over there. The masks total…”</p>, <p>I hurriedly gathered my magical power. I had to shut that damn fool’s mouth…</p>, <p>[The number of statues wearing masks stimulates the madness within your mind.]</p>, <p>It was too late. Sh*t!

Sure, it would result in a significant debuff, but if I could just succeed in a mental strength check here, there would be a way to counter it.</p>, <p>[Failure.]</p>, <p>Ah, you fu*king bastards! Do you think I’ll die here? I shoved my hand into my backpack, groping for the artifact, the artifact I had carefully packed just in case something like this happened…</p>, <p>[Onset of Distortion]</p>, <p>This was actually worse than being a rat in a trap. Stupid modern humans write numbers on everything they see. Car license plates, phone numbers, calendars, house numbers, page numbers in books, the remaining battery on smartphones, the number of floors in skyscrapers, the count of stairs, the number of passersby, the number of white lines on crosswalks, even the number of times a pigeon pecking at street trash nods its head, but no matter what, I couldn’t escape that number. Think about it. To go home, we take steps. One, two, three…. Eventually, my steps would reach that unlucky and ominous number. I breathe. Inhale one, exhale two, inhale three again… My breaths were advancing toward that number.</p>, <p>I tried everything to avoid groups of numbers, burned calendars, tried attaching different numbers, even attempted to split numbers up, and destroyed license plates I came across by chance, suddenly stopped walking, stopped breathing, and even considered wringing the neck of that insane pigeon, but I barely restrained myself.</p>, <p>But damn it, here I was, trapped in this cramped prison with no escape only to come face to face with that unlucky, dreadful number.</p>, <p>Disorientation didn’t always manifest in the same symptoms. At first, I experienced physical signs like difficulty breathing, hallucinations, itching, chills, and bodily pains. Then, there were times, like that one incident; who was it again? There was a big strange person in that underground parking lot, right? Anyway, it could also emerge as reckless charging and violence just like that person. Wait, what am I doing right now?</p>, <p><em>Ding.</em></p>, <p>A bell sound came from somewhere. Who could it be?</p>, <p><strong>Run away.</strong></p>, <p>It seemed like someone was speaking to me.</p>, <p><strong>Run, I said.</strong></p>, <p>Oh, really? But where to? In which direction? And why? Right now, this place is, well, unclear to me.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim? What do you mean, ‘run away’?”</p>, <p>Was that a voice I heard? Is there someone else here besides me? Do you know? There are more people in the world than one might think. Among them, some turn pale occasionally, and others dance. There are those who sometimes turn into stone and remain hidden. Occasionally, you might wonder why you ended up here. But don’t worry. But then, why do salmon lay eggs? Do salmon come from salmon eggs?</p>, <p><em>Ding.</em></p>, <p><strong>Snap out of it, you idiot! Wake up!</strong></p>, <p>Another bell tinkled, followed by someone shouting at me.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim! Look at that, over there!”</p>, <p>Ah, was it him speaking? The odd fellow pointed in a peculiar direction. A forsythia bloomed with a pop. With the weather growing warmer these days, how is the Bigfoot that transferred from Siberia doing?

This way or that? Despite realizing the existence of this unknown person, the disdain we feel towards what we consider the lonely darkness cannot bring us joy. What is it that spreads so widely in the swirling autumn sky? I turned my head toward a voice coming from somewhere.</p>, <p>Indeed, in the direction I turned my head.</p>, <p>Oh my gosh.</p>, <p>There existed a transcendental elegance and mythical beauty that should not belong in this world.</p>, <p>It was a breathtaking scene, unlike anything I had ever seen in my life.</p>, <p>Corpses. An eerie expanse filled with corpses that had stiffened while writhing in agony, frozen in place as they stood.</p>, <p>At the center of those corpses, dancers wearing beast masks were performing a dance that was strange, truly bizarre, eerie, and utterly extraordinary.</p>, <p>Alien bodies sprouting golden scales and colorful jewels dangling from their bodies.</p>, <p>Yellow silk fabrics billowed around their bodies.</p>, <p>No language that has existed since the dawn of this earth could adequately describe that dance, the movements, the swaying, and the twisting.</p>, <p>Under the dark sky, a great star burned yellow.

To our magnificent sanctuary, the beautiful Carcosa!”</p>, <p><em>Ding.</em></p>, <p><strong>It’s okay. It’s just a temporary symptom.</strong></p>, <p>What’s okay?

            "[<p>Escape? From what? Run? To where? Fight? With whom?</p>, <p>Dancers who were made from gold and shining brighter than the precious metal itself, maintained a precise distance from one another as they executed a synchronized and dazzling dance. Each grand movement of their limbs caused the golden silk wrapped around their bodies to billow dramatically.</p>, <p>The rocks that came into contact with the silk… they seemed to be sliced as if by a blade and fell away.</p>, <p>To the eye, it appeared merely as silk fluttering in the wind, but it possessed a magical, spiritual, surreal power, akin to a blade that cuts through everything it touches. The nature of the fluttering fabric mattered little.</p>, <p>The dance itself was a dance of death, brimming with madness and killing intent. Is that why I should escape this dance? Is he telling me to run away from this dance? Is it okay to fight this dance?</p>, <p>The golden whirlwind, swirling with the dance of death, approaches us, moving either slowly or at breakneck speed.</p>, <p>I may not know, but at least Jang Hyeon-deok is going to get caught up in this dance very soon and his body will be torn apart. Haha, that guy’s about to meet his end.</p>, <p><strong>No, destroy the number 13. Use magic. Just activate some kind of spell, anything!</strong></p>, <p>Aaah! Yes! Yes! Yes! The dance itself doesn’t matter! It’s not the dance that’s the issue, it’s the number of dancers performing it. Why such an ominous and unlucky number? My hands are shaking. I must deal with this! This! Escape! Run! No, fight! Yes, let’s destroy it! Use magic; activate the magic! I’ll scatter them using magic!</p>, <p>[The unique feature of the S-rank accessory ‘Ring of Corrupted Flame’ has been activated. ‘Red Element Concentration’ and ‘Legacy of Fire Knowledge’ are triggered.</p>, <p>// Red Element Concentration: Increases the effectiveness of all fire-type spells by 50%.</p>, <p>// Legacy of Fire Knowledge: Enhances understanding of ‘fire-type magic’.]</p>, <p>[Flame Eruption], [Fireball], [Lightning], [Protective Circle], [Crush], [Burning Spear], [Ignite], [Ember], [Rope Manipulation], [Body Manipulation: Specific Itching], [Ice Blast], [Gale], [Veil], [Leap], [Seed of Life], [Sparkling Dust], [Invisible Hand], [Creation: Raisin], [Ghastly Stare].</p>, <p><em>Boom! Crack! Whoosh! Fizz! Snap! Roar!</em></p>, <p>From my fingertips, all sorts of spells were unleashed in all sorts of ways and at the same time. Most of the activated spells either did not trigger properly or failed to trigger at all due to the lack of suitable targets.</p>, <p>Amidst this chaos, the few spells that did manage to activate caused everything within sight to flash, shake, burn, freeze, and explode! Everything was destroyed! Shattered! Annihilated! Everyone was dying!!!</p>, <p>Spinning, spinning around. Stars are visible. Am I looking up at the sky? Or am I lying on the ground? The world is spinning dizzyingly. Hahaha! My mind is reeling and my body feels unsteady. Who’s there? Where am I?</p>, <p>Through the acrid smoke rising into the sky (perhaps from the fire I started?), a dancer wearing a golden mask emerged. In his (her?) hand, he (she?) held a sharp sword that emitted a deadly radiance.</p>, <p><em>Ding.</em></p>, <p><em><strong>Snap out of it! Get your bearings! Dodge!</strong></em></p>, <p>Ah, first telling me to fight, and now to dodge, what exactly am I supposed to do? I can’t perform any action anyway. I’ve activated too many spells at once. My legs feel like they’re attached to my shoulders, and my arms feel like they’re stuck to my hips.</p>, <p>The blade was too close. Suddenly, the golden dancer’s eerie mask was right before my nose. And the cold gleam of the blade in its hand flew towards my neck.</p>, <p>Somehow, I felt like bursting into laughter.</p>, <p>[The unique effect of the L-rank accessory ‘Carcosa’s Mask’, ‘Dreamy Blur’, has been activated.</p>, <p>// Dreamy Blur: Automatically casts ‘Blink’ spell]</p>, <p>Although the golden dancer’s blade was aimed precisely between my head and body, the moment the blade was about to touch me, the magic imbued in the mask activated.</p>, <p>With a bizarre sensation that felt like being pulled by the mask, my position shifted from where I originally stood to a spot five steps behind.</p>, <p>[Blink completed. Cooldown time: 864,000 seconds]</p>, <p>“Ugh, damn it. I thought I was a goner!”</p>, <p>Rough breathing, a rising urge to vomit, dizziness, and a severe headache made it feel like both my head and lungs were about to burst. It was a dreadful situation where not a single part of my body, head, mind, or soul seemed intact, but the worst was yet to come…</p>, <p>“Ugh… what’s this?”</p>, <p>All the fingers on both hands were in a terrible state. The health +2 gloves I had spent a fortune on were rendered useless and destroyed, leaving my fingers completely exposed.</p>, <p>The skin was scorched black, and all the fingernails were shattered, with bright red blood oozing out. There were abnormal inflammations and swellings here and there… Ugh, fu*k. Some were even broken. I tried to remove the gloves with my trembling fingers, but they were too damaged. I managed to take off the gloves using my chin and teeth instead.</p>, <p>The gloves didn’t so much come off as they disintegrated, and I casually tossed aside the remnants. The events that had just taken place slowly reconstructed themselves in my mind. It seemed that the indiscriminate casting of spells in my distortion had backfired.</p>, <p>But I did it.</p>, <p>“Ha! You did it, Kim Shin-hwa!”</p>, <p>I managed to survive until the distortion ended!</p>, <p>[Achievement Unlocked!</p>, <p>You have overcome your phobia and defeated the object of your fear.</p>, <p>You have earned the ‘Advanced Achievement: Overcoming Fear’.</p>, <p>As a reward for the achievement, the phobia you have overcome is naturally cured and you will gain additional experience points.]</p>, <p>[System: ‘Mental illness — Triskaidekaphobia’ has been removed.]</p>, <p>Looking around, I saw areas ablaze, others shattered into pieces, and over there; wow~, a pillar of ice. There wasn’t a single rock standing intact within a ten-meter radius, and even some rocks as far as thirty meters away were smashed to bits.</p>, <p>And then there was the small bell made of pure silver lying on the ground.</p>, <p>It was the Silver Bell of the Underworld I had acquired three days ago in the basement of the apartment complex in Munsan.</p>, <p>[Silver Bell of the Underworld (S-rank Magical Tool): A magical tool crafted from pure silver mined by ghouls.</p>, <p>Grants the owner tremendous magical power along with dreadful madness…]</p>, <p>No need to read any further.</p>, <p>[Pure Silver’s Dominion: Automatically casts the ‘Voice of Authority’ spell on a designated target and increases the effect of ‘Mind’ spells by 100%.]</p>, <p>This was it.</p>, <p>This very ability.</p>, <p>Just before plunging into madness, I activated Pure Silver’s Dominion to manipulate my own mind. Since it wasn’t set in advance I couldn’t completely block the side effects of the distortion, but I managed to somehow direct my magic to attack the enemy.</p>, <p>The haphazard spells I unleashed managed to take down at least one of the thirteen dancers, and from the moment their number ceased to be thirteen, my distortion began to dissipate.</p>, <p>Had the distortion lasted even slightly longer, I would have been decapitated by one of the dancer’s attacks.</p>, <p>[System: Penalty trait ‘Shattered Mind’ is activated. Since you currently have only 1 mental illness, a random mental illness will manifest.]</p>, <p>“Aah, how diligent.”</p>, <p>You damn bastards, whoever it is that’s holding me in this world and messing with me, I swear I’ll kill them if I catch them.</p>, <p>[System: ‘Mental Illness—Ichthyophobia (fear of fish)’ has been inflicted on your mind.]</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>Wait, this isn’t right. Come on, play fair!</p>, <p>In some ways, this phobia was worse than the number 13 one. It’s not just about having one less option for lunch. In [Cthulhu World], this phobia is…</p>, <p>“K’hrrrrrr……!”</p>, <p>Aah, this was not the time for distractions. I hastily grabbed the silver bell, stuffed it into my backpack, and turned my attention towards the direction of the noise. There, just six paces away from where I stood, a creature loomed.</p>, <p>A creature of stunning beauty, its body shimmering like gold.</p>, <p>It bore a strange mask resembling the visage of a beast, its limbs were adorned with fluttering sharp silk, and it wielded jewel-encrusted swords.</p>, <p>This golden dancer was a servant of the [King in Yellow], a beautiful performer crafted from gold, a bodyguard to the king, and a high priest executing the will of the god.</p>, <p>The golden dancer clearly had a body that resembled a human, but it looked at me while making strange noises that could never be pronounced with human vocal structures.</p>, <p>It tilted its head slightly to the left while wearing a three-eyed beast mask that resembled the Mask of Carcosa I was wearing. One might describe it as a curious tilt, though it was uncertain if the golden dancer harbored any real thoughts in its head.</p>, <p>It was impossible to understand what it was thinking anyway. It was an entity with a thought process fundamentally alien to any intelligence known on Earth.</p>, <p>But one thing was clear. This bastard wanted me dead.</p>, <p>“R’haaarrrr… … rhigh!!”</p>, <p>The golden dancer lifted one foot in a peculiar motion as if assuming the arabesque position of ballet. Then, while leaving behind a trail of golden afterimages, it surged towards me with relentless force.</p>, <p><em>Dingle, clatter, ding!</em></p>, <p>The jewels and ornaments dangling from the dancer’s body clinked against its golden scales, creating a clamorous noise.</p>, <p>It possessed movements of transcendent beauty and exquisite grace, but the swords in its hands and the billowing silk around its body were not. Just brushing against either side would be a fatal attack.</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>It was an attack that couldn’t simply be blocked.</p>, <p>I shaped the activated protective circle not as a wide barrier but as thin pillars, weaving them through the air to intersect the golden dancer’s trajectory.</p>, <p>An invisible fence then materialized in the air. The dancer felt danger not through sight but through its instincts, and it attempted to change its course mid-air, but it was already too late.</p>, <p><em>Crackle!</em></p>, <p>I rapidly formed hand signs with my blackened hands, from which all my nails had been torn, and began to chant.</p>, <p>“It shall be the hammer of thunder that pounds hot iron.”</p>, <p>The wasted magical power and scattered mental strength that happened to me during the distortion prevented the proper activation of [Casting Omission] and [Sign Omission] traits. So I had to do them.</p>, <p>The moment the signs and incantations that were engraved in my mind were completed, blue sparks began to erupt from the bleeding tips of my fingers. These sparks soon transformed into a pulsating, writhing, huge bolt of lightning.</p>, <p><em>Fzzzzzzzzt!</em></p>, <p>[Thunderstorm]</p>, <p><em>Rumbleeee!</em></p>, <p>With a fierce crackling sound, the lightning tore through the air, grazing the ground and shattering the stones in its path.</p>, <p>It then poured its bursting energy towards the dancer who was entangled in invisible pillars and struggling.</p>, <p><em>Zzzzzzzt!!!</em></p>, <p>“K’haarrrr! fhteii, rhurrrrgh!”</p>, <p>“Wail, spew forth. Your screams shall be an offering to the Lord of the night sky, the Lord of Fomalhaut.”</p>, <p>Ah, I only realized how annoying this was when the traits were being omitted. But as the signs and incantations were completed, a sinister rumble began to emanate from beneath the ground.</p>, <p>[Firestorm]</p>, <p>As the ground beneath the golden dancer split open, flames erupted with the force of a volcanic explosion, shooting upwards in a brilliant red inferno.</p>, <p><em>Boooom!</em></p>, <p>The blast was deafening as if it could burst eardrums, and a dazzling pillar of flame engulfed the dancer’s alien body made of gold.</p>, <p>The fire magic, whose power was amplified by the concentration of red elements, pierced through its body. It was not a spell that could be withstood by mere resilience.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“Ugh… This is exhausting.”</p>, <p>It feels like my head is about to split open. Imagine gathering every single hangover one could experience in a lifetime and experiencing them all at once.</p>, <p>“Urrrgh! K’haarrrr!”</p>, <p>“R’haarrrr! Wzur-y’iin!”</p>, <p>It wasn’t time to stop yet. The dancers were muttering some stuff in a strange language. Even though some of them were broken and charred, there were still those with enough strength to move… Let’s see… There are nine of them?</p>, <p>“What are you saying? Speak in Korean, you bastards.”</p>, <p>A couple of them seemed to be squirming awkwardly, but that wasn’t something to worry about.</p>, <p>I slowly massaged my stiff neck, which refused to move easily, and thought about the actions I needed to take, the declarations I needed to make, and the objects I needed to keep an eye on.</p>, <p>“As if my condition wasn’t bad enough… After this is over, I really need to lie down for a week without moving.”</p>, <p>The nine dancers approached me in a synchronized formation. Though their numbers have decreased, their movements remained precise. They intertwined their legs and dipped their heads in my direction. Their movements were reminiscent of ballet poses. And then they followed with jumps and kicks.</p>, <p>If I had known a bit about ballet terminology, I might have been able to describe what they were doing, but there was no way for me to know something I hadn’t known before, regardless of my increased intelligence. And then there was the leap that followed. Staying any longer to watch would be the death of me.</p>, <p>I threw my skateboard to the ground and cast a few spells.</p>, <p>[Cat’s Reflexes]</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>It wasn’t for no reason that I was in a daze. As my concentration returned, the traits that had stopped activating began to function normally again, which allowed me to cast spells in succession without the need for signs or incantations.</p>, <p>As soon as I vacated my spot, the dancers’ performance transformed from ballet to a sword dance. Each held a sparkling pair of swords in their hands. The sword dance in honor of their king had started. It was a dance of death meant to eliminate the king’s enemies.</p>, <p>“I am a mage!”</p>, <p>Just like the last time with the ghoul shaman, why do they keep forcing me into physical confrontations? If my magic order was even one level higher, I might have been able to pull out a spell that would let me respond more comfortably, but for now, keeping my distance was the answer.</p>, <p>The magically enhanced skateboard emitted a dazzling radiance and bounced to ridiculous heights that would have been impossible for my original body. Yet, the golden dancers followed suit. Ten chillingly bright swords glowed. And yellow silk fluttered like clouds.</p>, <p>Their weapons were not limited to swords alone. The rocks that brushed against that fluttering yellow silk were sliced as if cut by a sword. Was this some kind of joke? The range of impact was far too wide.</p>, <p>The range a single dancer could attack spanned 4 meters in all directions—front, back, left, right, above, and below—and with their ability to close the distance in an instant through leaps, I couldn’t afford to stand still for even a moment. Leap, then spring off a rock to leap again. As soon as I touched the ground, I used an explosive dash trick for rapid movement. Then leaped again.</p>, <p>Just when I thought I had shaken off one that was clinging to me from behind, a golden body flew at me from the front. At this rate, there would be no end to it. I gathered my magical power and screamed.</p>, <p>“Get out of the wayyyy!!!”</p>, <p>[Shock]</p>, <p><em>Clang-clang-clang-clang-clang!!!</em></p>, <p>The dancer directly hit by the heated shockwave emitted from my hand was flung away and crashed into a rock with a metallic noise.</p>, <p>Just as I was about to cast a new spell to finish off that one, three dancers and six sword blades clung to me. They targeted the angles that were difficult for me to move into and flew in with precise sword strikes.</p>, <p>“Ah, sh*t. Leave the sword fighting to the swordsmen!”</p>, <p>[Gale], [Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p>[Leap], [Spell Enhancement: Range Increase]</p>, <p>[Protective Circle], [Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>I sent the one suspended in the air flying with a gale and the other one was forced to jump up, changing its trajectory. At the same time, I thrust the layers of entwined protective circles at the one that clung closest to me.</p>, <p><em>Clang!</em></p>, <p>Sparks flew from the twin swords blocked by the invisible protective circle. But I had lingered in one spot for too long. Eight more swords flew at me from another direction. Ah, this really could be the end of me.</p>, <p>Ah, forget it! I’m abandoning the strategy of minimizing damage!</p>, <p>With all my fingernails gone, I spread my hands wide and cast spells in every direction around me.</p>, <p><em>Whirrrr…!!</em></p>, <p>I concentrated the magical power, brimming with excessive Yang energy, on the tips of my hands. I could see the blood flowing from my torn and burst fingers start to boil and evaporate.</p>, <p>[Lightning Strike]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>It felt like all ten of my already damaged fingers were being completely shattered. A chilling pain crawled from the tips of my fingers up to my spine. Yet, the extremely strengthened lightning obeyed my command, absorbing my magical power and growing to an enormous size.</p>, <p><em>Fizzzzzzzz!</em></p>, <p>A blindingly brilliant golden lightning burst forth in all directions.</p>, <p>It felt as though giant trees were sprouting from my hands. It was a bizarre sensation in which I didn’t even know if I was feeling pain or pleasure. I felt dizzy. The trees of lightning grew at the speed of light and entwined around the dancers who were rushing towards me. Gold conducts electricity well, right?</p>, <p><em>Crackle-crackle-crackle!</em></p>, <p>While the dancers were paralyzed by the lightning, I created a fireball beneath my skateboard.</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p><em>Booooom!</em></p>, <p>At the peak of the fireball’s explosion….</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>I activated a leap and then leaped again. Despite the feeling that my guts might spill out, I shot up vertically more than twenty meters in an instant.</p>, <p><em>Whoooooooshl!</em></p>, <p>The sound of the wind battered my face and ears.</p>, <p>As I reached the peak of my leap, I threw my head back to look down. Or more accurately, I began to fall headfirst… Nonetheless, I could see the dark forest of Tanhyeon below me, the ruins that appeared almost naked in their exposure, and the dancers glittering under the starlight.</p>, <p>“K’haarrrr! kya’vughtmm!!”</p>, <p>“Waugh! F’huzur ghliis khaa!”</p>, <p>I could also see the dancers who had not been swept up by the lightning, gathering below my feet as if chasing after me. They were nicely clustered together.</p>, <p>Had there ever been a time in my life when so many people were clinging to me as if they were fond of me? It seemed my luck in love was at an all-time high. Anyway, they were gathered nicely together. The essence of a hunt is in the area of effect.</p>, <p>[Sonic Refraction]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>A barrier made from magical power rose around the dancers. A magical barrier distorting the sonic waves formed like a dome with its lid open.</p>, <p>Take this, the signature move of Lee Chang-hyuk.</p>, <p>[Sonic Impact]</p>, <p>“Kraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!”</p>, <p><em>Boooooooom!!!!!!!</em></p>, <p>The shock wave created by the Sonic Impact was blocked by the sonic distortion barrier and echoed back inward as it continued to reverberate.</p>, <p>The trapped shockwaves were unable to escape the barrier and continued to layer upon each other, manifesting terrible destruction.</p>, <p>The rocks of the ruins and the metallic bodies of the dancers, caught in the horrific vortex created by the sound, could not withstand the repeated shocks and were shattered to pieces.</p>, <p><em>Kwazzzz…</em></p>, <p>Even after I deactivated the spell, the shockwaves trapped within the sonic distortion barrier did not fade but persisted for a while.</p>, <p>The effect was more powerful than I expected. Given the right circumstances, this technique alone could dispose of most enemies in the future.</p>, <p>The destruction on the ground was sufficient. Now, it was time to save myself.</p>, <p>[Feather Fall]</p>, <p>I tried to catch the skateboard in mid-air while activating a spell to reduce the speed of my fall… Well, I tried to catch it before I realized such a feat was beyond my agility. I then resorted to an additional spell to catch it.</p>, <p>The ordeal was not over yet.</p>, <p>I looked up at the sky in the midst of my long, leisurely fall through the air.</p>, <p>The dark night sky.</p>, <p>And the bright yellow stars that illuminated it while shining brightly.</p>, <p><em>What a crazy sky.</em></p>, <p>It was a terrible and ominous sky that made you feel like you would go mad if you just kept looking at it. Though the moon hung in the air, its faint crescent light was overshadowed by the unnervingly bright stars that exuded a far more imposing presence.</p>, <p>“Fu*k it, I’ll do whatever crazy thing it takes to get back home.”</p>, <p>With that resolve, I landed in the center of the chaotic ruins.</p>, <p>“Surprisingly, no achievements popped up.”</p>, <p>I had half-expected something like a “Shall We Dance?” achievement. Aaah, but that would require me to dance as well.</p>, <p>The frenzied dancers, for the most part, were unable to overcome the overlapping sonic shockwaves and were completely destroyed.</p>, <p>Of course, not all of them were annihilated. Four dancers remained alive.</p>, <p>However, they were far from unscathed. Now, the figures that used to attack with bodies glowing in golden light and dancing with unprecedented grace in the world were nowhere to be seen.</p>, <p>All four dancers were affected by the sonic shockwaves in some way, with their metallic bodies ruptured and crumbling.</p>, <p>The sight of them struggling to crawl away, using what remained of their arms and legs which were reduced to stubs, was a spectacle that was both tragic and comedic.</p>, <p>Anyway, this is the [Cthulhu World]. Where there was no bargaining with beings born from the darkness of the abyss.</p>, <p>As I approached them, the dancers began to chant in unison.</p>, <p>“K’haarrrr!”</p>, <p>“K’haarrrr!”</p>, <p>“K’haarrrr!”</p>, <p>“K’haarrrr!”</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! Hastur! Ugh! Ugh! Iä Hastur! n’ghah- ghaaa mglw’ghaa mhatha!”</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! Hastur!”</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! Hastur!”</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä!

But, three remained.</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! Hastur!”</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! Hastur!”</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! Hastur!”</p>, <p>[Lightning Strike]</p>, <p><em>Rumbe… … Booom!!</em></p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! Hastur!”</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! Hastur!”</p>, <p>They still wouldn’t stop. This is maddening…! Stop chanting, you lunatics!</p>, <p>[Firestorm]</p>, <p>Despite this, there was still one mouth left and it continued to chant the true name of the abyssal being.</p>, <p>[Magic Bullet]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p><em>Ratatatattatata!!</em></p>, <p>Dozens of magic bullets were unleashed, shattering the body of the last dancer to pieces. Holes riddled the dancer’s body, scattering golden scales and body fragments in all directions.</p>, <p>But even when its body was destroyed and only its head remained, the dancer’s head still emitted cries of praise for its king.</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! Hastur!”</p>, <p>The rolling head of the dancer eventually came to a halt after it was blocked by someone’s legs.</p>, <p>“Oh? You.”</p>, <p>The problem wasn’t the dancer. A new shadow appeared as if blocking the dancer’s path. Long limbs and golden hair. And strange ornaments on the ears.</p>, <p>No, this was not a new character. It was someone who was supposed to be here all along. It was Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>“You… what are you doing…?”</p>, <p>Wait, something was off. The quality, form, and flow of his magical power were completely different. Jang Hyeon-deok approached the dancer’s head with an eerily emotionless expression on his face.</p>, <p>The dancer’s head was not moving away from me. It was moving in the direction of Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>“Hey, stop.”</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p><em>Fwsssh!</em></p>, <p>In haste, I unleashed an arrow imbued with the magical power of the neither world towards Jang Hyeon-deok’s location. But for some reason, the purple arrow flew swiftly but veered off in an unexpected direction.</p>, <p>It wasn’t like my aim was bad. The Arrow of Destruction was flying straight towards Jang Hyeon-deok. But then, as if space itself warped, the arrow changed its course on its own.</p>, <p>Before I could think of my next move, Jang Hyeon-deok had already completed his action. A peaceful and natural touch with a motion that seemed as if it was meant to be.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok removed the mask that was covering the dancer’s face and placed it on his own.</p>, <p>And then, silence.</p>]\n",

It was indeed big, but it was still big enough to be contained within my field of vision if it moved far enough away. Which meant it was a being that I could talk about, describe, and understand.</p>, <p>Holy shit.</p>, <p>I get it now.</p>, <p>“Fu*k, seriously. Who do you take me for, a fool?”</p>, <p>It wasn’t the [King in Yellow] that had descended.</p>, <p>This wasn’t its true form.</p>, <p>Not even an avatar.</p>, <p>This was a shadow created by the [King in Yellow], a messenger sent for a high-dimensional, metaphysical scheme that only they could comprehend. It was merely a voice created by lowering its status and bending its form to communicate with a being with whom communication was otherwise impossible.</p>, <p>But that didn’t mean I was capable of confronting it now. Damn it… I was still lacking in both level and magic order. I didn’t know what it wanted to convey, but if I showed a response it didn’t like, it would whimsically crush me on a whim.</p>, <p>And I could understand all of this situation, starting with the taxi driver brainwashed by the [Yellow Sign]. If they had wanted to lure me in and kill me or whatever, they wouldn’t have sent such a pawn; they would have brought something much larger and more dangerous.</p>, <p>In a state of half-resignation, I addressed the golden illusion created by Jang Hyeon-deok’s mask, the shadow created by the [King in Yellow].</p>, <p>“So, speak then. What is it you wish to convey that you’ve drawn me in with such a convoluted method?”</p>, <p>The bizarre mask shimmered expressionlessly.</p>, <p>It was modeled after the form of a beast, similar to the one I was wearing. The difference lay in the fact that this mask had six eyes.</p>, <p><strong>A mere entertainment for the feast.</strong></p>, <p>A voice that was neither male nor female, neither human nor monster, but simply beautiful. Though beautiful, it carried an indescribably eerie discomfort.</p>, <p><strong>Remarkable. You have proven your strength, mind, and wisdom. For a pitiful and lowly human, this is a commendable achievement. I commend you for reaching this far. I shall allow you to regard this as a glory for your lineage.</strong></p>, <p>Ah, so beating up the dancers was the proof of strength, enduring the mental attack was the proof of mind, and somewhat figuring out its identity was the proof of wisdom? Is this amusing to you? What a load of crap.</p>, <p><strong>I also permit you to express a wish. Speak your desire. Reveal your longing. Bring forth the desire that has been harbored in your soul even before you were born. Speak. I shall fulfill your most vile desire that you have never voiced to anyone.</strong></p>, <p>I considered unleashing a tirade of curses but somehow managed to hold myself back.</p>, <p>Even during my time playing [Cthulhu World] as a game, I encountered a similar scenario. Regardless of the response I gave, it would be deemed to be entering into a contract. My wish would be granted in the most wretched way possible, and then I would definitely pay the price for it.</p>, <p>But that didn’t mean not answering was the right answer. He wouldn’t disappear for eternity until I gave an answer. What should I say?</p>, <p>The period of contemplation was brief. I made my decision and responded to him.</p>, <p>“I’m not interested.”</p>, <p>Despite my response, the being behind the mask covering Jang Hyeon-deok’s body showed no response.</p>, <p>“I never wanted to come to this damned world in the first place, nor do I have any desires in this crazy world. I refuse to be destroyed while clinging to unwanted gifts, and I’m already aware that there’s nothing you can fulfill for me. I’ll find my own way back home……”</p>, <p>I almost blurted out to go screw themselves and to just leave me be.</p>, <p>Telling them to leave me alone would probably be taken as a wish, and then they’d demand payment for not doing anything. But since I couldn’t take back what I had already said, I ended my sentence with a somewhat awkward phrase.</p>, <p>“…that’s it.”</p>, <p>Due to excessive tension and fatigue, my neck felt stiff. A fleeting thought crossed my mind that it was an unsightly state to be in, but the situation had already taken a toll on my appearance. Instead of just holding back, I began to massage the back of my neck while channeling magical power.</p>, <p>Had I reached a higher level by this point, I would have had more options at my disposal. However, at this moment, there was only one course of action available to me.</p>, <p>I started to draw out the remaining magical power within me and focused my mind intensely. The spell was to forcibly send back this divine being that had descended into reality.</p>, <p><em>Tch, this spell isn’t even permitted in my current order.</em></p>, <p>It really has been one risky play after another since last time.</p>, <p>I would have preferred to use high-level spells like [Banishment of the Otherworldly], [Expulsion of the Summoned], or [Song of Return], but none of those were available to me at the moment. Therefore, I decided to stack lower-level spells to construct a magical logic and environment.</p>, <p>[Exhilaration]</p>, <p>[Eagle’s Splendor]</p>, <p>[Prayer of Protection]</p>, <p>I wasn’t sure if it would help, but I activated these related enchantment spells to elevate my body and mind and started pushing away the influence created by this outer god.</p>, <p>Then, I took out the silver bell of the underworld and shook it. The tiny silver bell emitted a refreshing tone before releasing the magical power it contained.</p>, <p>[The unique effects of the S-grade magical tool ‘Silver Bell of the Underworld’, ‘Pure Silver’s Charm’ and ‘Pure Silver’s Dominion’ have been activated</p>, <p>//Pure Silver’s Dominion: Automatically casts the ‘Voice of Authority’ spell on a designated target and increases the effect of ‘Mind’ spells by 100%.</p>, <p>//Pure Silver’s Charm: Charm +2 only for ghouls, undead, and demons]</p>, <p>Even as I was applying buffs, the ‘King in Yellow’ simply watched me without making any move or showing any reaction.</p>, <p>Indeed, if I were in their place, I too would be curious enough to watch if I saw an ant suddenly emitting magic circles and starting to dance. Please keep watching until the end.</p>, <p>I created dozens of magic circles around me. These were not for a single consistent spell. There were circles for amplification, for organizing the flow of magical power, for ascending and sublimating power, for descending and solidifying power, for release, decomposition, protection, hardening, focusing, dispersing, and rotating.</p>, <p>Each one was a magic circle designed to implement the most basic principles of the simplest spells.</p>, <p>But all of them moved in perfect harmony under my will, creating a single grand miracle. It became a primitive yet vast magical engine constructed outside my body.</p>, <p>I fueled this huge magical engine and activated the spell.</p>, <p>[Identification]</p>, <p><em>Paaaaa…</em></p>, <p>A bright blue light was emitted from my fingertips…</p>, <p>[System: Invalid target.]</p>, <p>I know. In the first place, identification was a spell intended for identifying artifacts or lifting minor seals.</p>, <p>I pushed the released magic into the magical engine. The magic, passing through the circles of the magical engine, was forcibly decomposed, concentrated, rotated, dispersed, and then reassembled. I then directed the strands of this transformed magical power towards the mask covering Jang Hyeon-deok’s face.</p>, <p><em>Crackle, Fizzz, Fzzzzt!</em></p>, <p>As expected, ominous golden sparks began to fly from the mask Jang Hyeon-deok was wearing. At the same time, a bright yellow magic circle formed in front of the mask.</p>, <p><em>That magic circle is…</em></p>]\n",

I felt that without borrowing the authority or endorsement of a being with sufficient power, I might just be swept away.</p>, <p>Should I borrow the power of the [Living Flame] as I did during Lee Chang-hyuk’s incident?

They were extremely unpleasant, dirty, ugly, beautiful, writhing, squirming, slithering, and glistening as they moved in a grotesque dance of oozing, undulating horror. These tentacles, tentacles, tentacles, tentacles, tentacles, tentacles, tentacles, tentacles, tentacles, tentacles.</p>, <p>“Ah, for fu*k’s sake. Enough.”</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated.

I wasn’t sure what I had just prevented, but it felt like something important had been blocked. What mattered wasn’t what I had blocked, but that it had been blocked at all.</p>, <p>I focused and concentrated the magical power I had released, sharpening it, honing it to a fine point, and tightening it until it formed a blade.</p>, <p>At that moment, a lukewarm and damp breeze blew from the ruins which were cluttered with bizarrely shaped rocks.</p>, <p><em>Uooooooo…</em></p>, <p>The wind, as it brushed against the rocks of the ruins, created a sound akin to a groan or perhaps a cry of anguish.</p>, <p>Even though I felt as though these sounds were a warning to cease my current actions immediately, I did not stop but instead completed my task.</p>, <p>[System: The penalty trait ‘Feast Offering’ has been activated.]</p>, <p><em>Buzzzz….</em></p>, <p>[The beings of the abyss have taken an interest in you.]</p>, <p><em>Thump… Thump… Thump…</em></p>, <p>The sound of a heartbeat reached my ears.</p>, <p><em>Screech… Screeeeech…</em></p>, <p>I experienced a dreadful sensation as if something exceedingly sharp was scraping against my mana core.</p>, <p><em>Fizz!

There is no place for you in this world. Return to the filthy, dark abyss where you came from. I will not allow you to set foot here. Be gone.</p>, <p>The magic circle I conjured was more forceful and unyielding than any magic I had previously created.</p>, <p>Gigigigi… Gogogogo… Gagagaga…</p>, <p>The vibrations began to spread, reaching beyond the ruins and into the nearby forest.</p>, <p>It was a terrible, threatening vibration that felt as if the ground could split open and the sky might collapse at any moment.</p>, <p>Silence! Shut up! Be quiet! Leave me alone! Disappear!!!</p>, <p><em>Crackkkkkkkkkk!!!!</em></p>, <p>An irrational sound of friction began to be heard from somewhere.</p>, <p>And then silence.</p>, <p>The mask covering Jiang Hyeon-deok’s face.</p>, <p>Cracks began to form on that mask.</p>, <p><strong>How delightful. I shall observe how long you can endure. I eagerly await the day you crawl through the mire calling for me.</strong></p>, <p>The crack at the corner of the mask grew uncontrollably and spread over it. His power and authority were leaking through the cracks. No matter what bullsh*t this bastard spewed, there was no turning back.</p>, <p>Contrary to the crumbling state of the mask, the King in Yellow’s shadow moved Jiang Hyeon-deok’s body in a nonchalant manner and pointed in a direction in the night sky.</p>, <p><strong>Soon, the deluge will begin. Build an ark before then. And if you can prevent the impending doom after the waters recede and the firmament clears, things will be as you wish.</strong></p>, <p>“What?

You have banished a being of the abyss.</p>, <p>You have obtained the ‘Advanced Achievement: The Uninvited Guest’.</p>, <p>As a reward for the achievement, you receive the ‘Artifact: Keystone’ and additional experience points.]</p>, <p>As soon as the achievement notification appeared as if by chance or as if someone had artificially staged it, a small stone rolled out of Jang Hyeon-deok’s arms and fell to the floor.</p>, <p><em>Thud.</em></p>, <p>It is a soft gray-brown stone shaped like a pyramid with rounded edges.</p>, <p>Ah, the keystone. It had been a while since I’d seen one. It was the reward given for sending back any being of the abyss that had descended to the earth, in whatever form.</p>, <p>[Keystone (A-rank Magical Artifact) – A small piece of stone made from an alien material that has never existed on Earth.

Therefore, I couldn’t read the inscriptions, but I had verified the meaning of these patterns several times from my previous gameplays. They weren’t anything profound.</p>, <p>“You cannot escape this dream unless the abyss allows it.”</p>, <p>After thinking about it, I felt bad because it sounded like these words were being said to me.</p>, <p>“Haah…”</p>, <p>Was this it then? This event was no joke. I had braced myself from the moment I encountered Jiang Hyeon-deok but this was seriously no laughing matter… My legs started to give out.</p>, <p>I simply allowed myself to collapse in a heap. There was nothing more to worry about anyway.</p>, <p>“I’ve never seen such a turn of events. What’s with these abyss bastards making a beeline for me right from the start? What exactly are they trying to accomplish?”</p>, <p>Ugh, damn it. Sitting down hadn’t been a wise decision. My legs, back, shoulders, head, neck… essentially, my entire body felt drained of strength, and my head threatened to loll backward. I tried to prop myself up with my arms in an attempt to prevent my body from collapsing entirely…</p>, <p>“Ughhh…”</p>, <p>My fingers felt as though they were being sliced by a blade. Ahhh… my fingernails were completely gone… Because of the sudden pain, I ended up sprawled on the ground with my hands clutched to my chest.</p>, <p>The ground was hard and littered with stone fragments and pieces of masks… but I just lay there for a while since I lacked the energy to get up.</p>, <p>When I turned my head and looked at the sky while lying down, I saw that the sky which was fluctuating strangely and the yellow star that was shining brighter than the moon had all returned to normal.</p>, <p>Had I essentially finished what I had come here to do?</p>, <p>But then, why wasn’t I receiving any experience points?</p>, <p>This bizarre ruin was a place I had never visited while playing [Cthulhu World], so I couldn’t be certain, but given the magnitude of this event, it seemed like it could at least be a hidden quest. But why was the message window silent?

An unresolved trigger usually meant that there were still monsters left to deal with.</p>, <p>In my current state, I wouldn’t be able to respond to anything that came my way.

Rather than articulating any meaningful speech, it seemed more akin to a groan.</p>, <p>“What’s this? There’s one still alive?”</p>, <p>I didn’t expect anyone to have survived that chaos…</p>, <p>When I approached the source of the groaning, sure enough, there was a golden dancer still clinging to life.</p>, <p>However, it appeared it wouldn’t have much longer to even groan.</p>, <p>This dancer held on till the very end only to have its mask taken by Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>Despite being hit by dozens of magic bullets, it stubbornly proclaimed the true name of the [King in Yellow] to the very end.</p>, <p>And here it was still alive.</p>, <p>Its condition was gruesome, with only its head and the upper part of its chest remaining intact, but it was alive nonetheless.</p>, <p>“Hey.”</p>, <p>“rrrr……”</p>, <p>“You’re really something, aren’t you?

Say it clearly so I can understand.”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>Perhaps it was its last bit of strength, but the dancer could speak no more. It wasn’t breathing, yet it wasn’t dead either. Although it was capable of making sounds, it was not a being that required breathing in the first place.</p>, <p>Its face was literally crafted from gold. Its smoothly polished face appeared to resemble a human at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it was clear that it was the face of a creature far removed from humanity. It was alien and grotesque…. A truly monstrous beauty.</p>, <p>“I came here to retrieve the mask, but it seems that’s no longer an option…”</p>, <p>I slowly gathered my magical power as I continued.</p>, <p>“I don’t want to leave empty-handed, so it looks like I’ll have to take you with me instead.”</p>, <p>The dancer blinked its four jewel-like eyes in shock and tried to speak but its mouth was empty and devoid of tongue or teeth.

While it was impossible to keep a living creature alive in such confinement, this being was more akin to a mechanical device.

They either came here waiting for the King in Yellow to descend or were spawned as a harbinger of that descent.</p>, <p>[You have eliminated all the golden dancers you encountered in the ruins and destroyed the masks they were wearing. Now, the only ‘Mask of Carcosa’ remaining on earth is the one you possess. The first mask, which was inherently more powerful than the other ‘Masks of Carcosa’, will gain even stronger power. If you can destroy other objects bearing the yellow sign, you will experience even more amazing miracles.]</p>, <p>[System: You have met the specified conditions so the hidden power within the L-rank accessory ‘Carcosa’s Mask’ is now activated.]</p>, <p>“What’s this? The mask has been strengthened?”</p>, <p>I briefly felt the mask covering my face to assess its condition.</p>, <p>There was a definite change. The sections that were previously displayed as ■■■■ : ■■■■■ on the Carcosa’s Mask had started to show correctly.</p>, <p>[Invitation to Carcosa: You can visit the grand and beautiful Carcosa through your dreams.</p>, <p>Madman’s Dexterity: You can unlock the hidden abilities of an artifact or attempt modifications to bestow other powers. You get a +100% success rate in invention, repair, research, and development.</p>, <p>However, each use of this ability requires a sanity check. Failure in the check will result in a random mental illness afflicting your mind.]</p>, <p>“This is….”</p>, <p>Isn’t it great?</p>, <p>The Invitation to Carcosa might seem like a meaningless trait in most cases. Carcosa is the dimension where the King in Yellow resides. Visiting such a mad world in a human body would only yield the special culture and habits unique to Carcosa, along with madness.</p>, <p>However, Madman’s Dexterity was an incredibly beneficial trait that couldn’t be obtained with a regular build. But in exchange for its excessively good effects, it came with the penalty of acquiring a mental illness at a certain probability, but this penalty could be erased with [Madness of the Abyss].</p>, <p>The ability to modify artifacts… It was a trait beyond my wildest dreams and it was just too good to be true.</p>, <p>I was pondering where to use the dancer I had just secured, but now it seemed I could try various experiments with it, whatever it turned out to be.</p>, <p>Then, the message window began to display the standard experience gain messages.</p>, <p>[You have completely destroyed the ruins for the descent. Experience points gained.]</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>[You have defeated ‘Fanatic—Jang Hyeon-deok’. Your understanding of the King in Yellow’s cult has increased.]</p>, <p>[You have defeated the golden dancers (13). Your understanding of ‘Creatures of Carcosa’ has significantly increased.]</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>[Discovery: You have acquired (2) secret items from the ruins. Experience points gained.]</p>, <p>[Discovery: You have found a secret space. Experience points gained.]</p>, <p>[Achievement unlocked! You have freed a human from the control of an abyssal being.</p>, <p>You have earned the ‘General Achievement: Are You Awake Now?’.</p>, <p>As a reward for the achievement, you gain a firm alliance with ‘Driving Expert—Jang Hyeon-deok’ and additional experience points.]</p>, <p>“…. Is that kid still alive?”</p>, <p>It’s still too early to be certain.</p>, <p>The game [Cthulhu World] is notorious for its numerous bugs and shoddy optimization. In fact, during gameplay, it’s not uncommon to see relationship information for NPCs that should be dead or shouldn’t even appear.</p>, <p>And what’s with this kind of reward? Give me an artifact or a special ability.</p>, <p>What’s the benefit of forming a solid alliance with a secure taxi driver? Maybe I’ll save on taxi fares in the future?</p>, <p>[Experience Point Bonus: You have achieved a total of (2) achievements at the ruins for the descent.]</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>[You have reached level 22! As a level achievement reward, you receive (1) bonus stat point to distribute freely.]</p>, <p>[For you who have accumulated enough experience points, you have unlocked the use of second-order magic. Please note that to use second-order magic effectively, you need to obtain or learn a grimoire containing second-order spells.]</p>, <p>[System: The ‘Spell Mastery’ trait is activated. You automatically learn the basic spells of the second tier.]</p>, <p>Finally, second-order spells are unlocked and I’ve received a bonus stat point.</p>, <p>After pondering where to allocate the bonus stat point for a moment, the loss of the Slurping Gloves, which had previously boosted my health, came to mind, so I allocated them to my health. Though this slightly complicated the schedule I had in mind, there was no other choice.</p>, <p>There was simply no easy way to obtain an artifact that could increase health by two points. For future progress, securing at least 8 points in health was essential.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa</p>, <p>Class: Mage Gazing into the Abyss</p>, <p>Level: 22</p>, <p>Magic Order: Second Order</p>, <p>Madness: [Mask Obsession], [Ichthyophobia (Fear of Fish)]</p>, <p>Strength: 5(+3) (Corrupted Ring of Flame)</p>, <p>Health: 7</p>, <p>Agility: 8</p>, <p>Intelligence: 30</p>, <p>Mental Strength: 14</p>, <p>Charm: 17</p>, <p>****</p>, <p><em>There must be a way to secure at least one more point in health…</em></p>, <p>[Your accomplishments were truly amazing. Although the abyssal being had not fully descended in its complete form, it was an endpoint created by the entity’s own will. It was an absurd being, one that seemingly could not be defeated. Yet you overcame such a being with nothing but your own wisdom and skill. This is a truly an amazing event! Your remarkable feat is echoing through the deep abyss. More beings from the abyss will be watching you from now on.]</p>, <p>…Is that supposed to be a good thing? I just want to beg them to lose interest in me.</p>, <p>[What could the words left by the King in Yellow mean? When will the deluge occur? Can you prevent the impending doom? And can you overcome the fate of becoming a feast offering at the banquet?</p>, <p>A chaotic future awaits you.]</p>, <p>Damn, there’s no wiki and no other veteran players to ask, so I have no idea what’s going on.</p>, <p>Then again, who would know about a situation like this? There has never been anyone who knew more about [Cthulhu World] than I did. There’s nobody to ask in this world, nor in the reality I used to live in.</p>, <p>If I want to understand what’s happening, I have no choice but to check it out myself, even if it means getting bruised and broken.</p>, <p>It seems there are no more messages coming through now.</p>, <p>“Ugh… Damn it, let’s go home.”</p>, <p>After muttering that to myself, I tried to put the dancer’s head into my backpack… but it was too big.</p>, <p>It wouldn’t fit. Moreover, my backpack was already filled with the silver bell from the underworld and various other artifacts… there was simply no room for this large, shiny head. Damn, I was carrying too much.</p>, <p>Ah, but there was still more to gather.</p>, <p>I turned my head to look at the pile of golden dancers’ bodies.</p>, <p>The scene was ambiguous, teetering between horrific and beautiful.</p>, <p>They glittered as if dusted with gold powder.</p>, <p>“It’s almost blinding.”</p>, <p>It was like a bizarre reflection of the night sky’s brilliance.</p>, <p>Thirteen golden dancers lay shattered; their bodies’ golden scales spilled out. And the brightly colored jewels that adorned their bodies were not in short supply either. There was enough to adorn thirteen humans.</p>, <p>Because of this, the amount of gold and jewels scattered and spread around was absurd. Just witnessing this scene could drive many to madness.</p>, <p>In addition, the completely motionless fragments of the dancers’ bodies… still retained their sensual forms, turning the barren ground of the ruins, where not a single blade of grass had grown, into a beautiful yet filthy wasteland littered with golden sculptures of corpses.</p>, <p>“If only this were real gold…”</p>, <p>Too bad, but this was not real gold.</p>, <p>The split and cracked bodies of the dancers, the golden scales scattered on the ground, and the brightly colored jewels that adorned their bodies… were slowly turning black. They might maintain the appearance of treasures for a week or two, but it would be difficult to find a foolish enough merchant in Paju willing to buy such items.</p>, <p><em>However, if I could find the right buyer, there might be a way to dispose of them.</em></p>, <p>These items were crafted from materials from the depths of the abyss, and they were imbued with the magic and alien thoughts of another world. They possessed a lethal and profound danger and magical effect that was as deep and deadly as the stories they held within.</p>, <p>Should I take these with me… Hmm… Looking up, I saw stars embedded in the high night sky, shining as if they were about to spill over, and looking around, the dense forests of Tanhyeon could be seen beyond the ruins turned to rubble.</p>, <p>How do I make my way back from here anyway?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“I do know how to drive, but…”</p>, <p>Should I load everything into Jang Hyeon-deok’s call van and head back? That’s not a choice I want to make…</p>, <p>Stealing a secure taxi and getting caught would make me an enemy of the Paju Transport Association. Not only would a bounty be placed on my head, but I would also be unable to use any form of transportation in Paju until I paid a tribute to lift the hostile status.</p>, <p>“Finding a taxi willing to come all the way here is impossible anyway…”</p>, <p>No choice then. I scratched my head and walked towards where Jang Hyeon-deok lay collapsed.</p>, <p>“Ah, damn it… Tonight is really something else.”</p>, <p>Though I confirmed in the message a little while ago that I had gained a firm alliance with Jang Hyeon-deok, it’s impossible that he’s still alive.</p>, <p>Even if a minor ghost or a demon possessed his body, it would cause it to deteriorate. But Jang Hyeon-deok directly harbored the will of an abyssal being in his body. Even if he shared the damage as a medium, survival is out of the question. If by some miracle he did survive, the never-ending divine heat would soon disintegrate his body, or he could be completely dominated by the abyss’s influence. This would lead to the collapse of both body and mind and he would turn into a madman or a monster.</p>, <p>Well, if he were to become a golden dancer, it would mean retaining a human form, which could be considered lucky compared to transforming into an ugly descendant of Carcosa or a fulfiller of oaths.</p>, <p>But I soon faced a situation I hadn’t anticipated.</p>, <p>“Well, what do we have here? This guy’s still alive?”</p>, <p>To my surprise, he was still alive and in relatively good health no less. He was certainly bruised, dirty and passed out, but he had no severe fractures or was spilling out anything that shouldn’t be spilled. And all of his ten fingers were intact on his hands.</p>, <p>Compared to my burnt, torn, broken, and burst fingers, it was almost irritating.</p>, <p>“Hmm… He hasn’t turned into a monster.”</p>, <p>But just because he looked alright on the outside didn’t mean everything was fine.</p>, <p>“But the insides might not be intact, right?”</p>, <p>I remembered the situation that occurred right before I fell into distortion. Jang Hyeon-deok was praising the dancers’ performance with a burst of manic laughter.</p>, <p>“Waking him up might only result in delirious ramblings…”</p>, <p>In the worst case, he might let out a shrieking yell and attack me.</p>, <p>I tapped the mask covering my face with my fingers while lost I was in thought for a moment.</p>, <p>The deliberation was brief, and I reached a conclusion.</p>, <p>[Prayer of Protection]</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Fox’s Agility]</p>, <p>This and that and a few more. I felt a pain akin to my fingers tearing apart each time I activated a spell, but I couldn’t afford even a moment’s distraction.</p>, <p>“I’ll be lucky if he doesn’t suddenly start spewing tentacles from his mouth…”</p>, <p>However, considering my [Enhanced Vigilance] trait hadn’t been activated, it seemed unlikely that I was facing a trap quite that dangerous. I maintained a distance of about two meters from Jang Hyeon-deok and activated a new spell.</p>, <p>Since I have recently acquired the ability to cast second-order spells, it seemed fitting to test them out right now. This one wasn’t a flashy spell, but it was one of the crucial ones needed to survive in the [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>[Inspection]</p>, <p>If the first-order [Identification] spell was used to ascertain the origin or composition of objects, then the second-order [Inspection] spell was meant to discern the nature of places, people, or even the identities of unknown species. In simpler terms, it was similar to viewing someone else’s status window.</p>, <p>Of course, it didn’t grant me knowledge I didn’t already possess. It merely provided the information that “A = B”. But that was enough.</p>, <p><em>After all, there’s no one who knows more about the [Cthulhu World] than I do.</em></p>, <p><em>Giiiiii….</em></p>, <p>The magical tentacles conjured by [Inspection] reached toward Jang Hyeon-deok and slowly started scanning him from head to toe. They were assessing everything from external mutations to internal conditions and inherent traits.</p>, <p>“He seems… fine?”</p>, <p>Surprisingly, Jang Hyeon-deok’s mind was as clean as his outward appearance. Of course, this didn’t mean he was entirely normal.</p>, <p>He had witnessed shocking things and acquired knowledge that should have remained unknown. He bore the minimum level of madness and trauma—mental scars that come with the revelation of this world’s truths—but such afflictions are commonplace among those who navigate the dangerous nights of Paju.</p>, <p>For a body that had once harbored an abyssal being, he was alarmingly well.</p>, <p>Lee Chang-hyuk, who had become a satyr after coming into contact with the bodily fluids of [The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young], the ghoul shaman who was corrupted by the power bestowed by [The Father of All Ghouls], and Lee Soon-bin, whose mind had shattered simply because she had been surrounded by ghouls and witnessed a ritual dedicated to [The Father of All Ghouls]. These are typical outcomes for those who had ventured too close to abyssal beings.</p>, <p>“But why is this bastard so unaffected…? Aaah, is it because of this?”</p>, <p>The effect of my observation revealed the flow and functioning of the magical power within Jang Hyeon-deok’s body. Although it was my first time examining someone else’s magical flow and pathways, thanks to my knowledge as a mage and the [Spell Mastery] trait that was artificially built in my head I was able to understand the meaning of Jang Hyeon-deok’s magical power structure.</p>, <p>If I were to reconstruct that structure in the form of a characteristic window, it would be as follows:</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>[Living Altar]: The efficiency of possession, spirit channeling, and descent is increased by 1200%. It minimizes the penalties associated with possession, spirit channeling, and descent. It largely disregards the restrictions of possession, spirit channeling, and descent.</p>, <p>// You possess a natural talent for mediumship. You are more akin to a living altar than a human being with free will.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>This is a top-tier trait necessary for mediums, shamans, channelers…. or even cultist characters, and it’s not something one can simply acquire just because they want it. Although I’ve played as a medium and a cultist in the past, I’ve only had the opportunity to play with the [Living Altar] trait a couple of times.</p>, <p>Look at that 1200% increase in efficiency.</p>, <p>Why does a taxi driver NPC have it?</p>, <p>Of course, it’s not a unique trait like the [Madness of the Abyss] or a hidden trait that can only be acquired in a specific way. Since it’s a kind of talent, it’s possible for a completely random character to possess it.</p>, <p>Could this be an aftereffect of the [King in Yellow’s] descent? Did he modify Jang Hyeon-deok’s magical traits before leaving…? But why would the King in Yellow do such a thing? To make him a useful subordinate for Kim Shin-hwa? Or to make it easier for him to return?</p>, <p>In any case, this is a question that cannot be answered in this state. Trying to figure it out through thought and deduction alone would trap me in endless speculation and leave me unable to do anything. Perhaps the answer is diving headfirst into the bushes for a closer look?</p>, <p>“Hey, wake up.”</p>, <p>[Cry of Bennu]</p>, <p>The Cry of Bennu was a second-order enchantment spell. It temporarily enhances mental strength and vitality, provides a tonic effect, and also prevents several status ailments. Notably, it can also be used to wake up an unconscious target.</p>, <p>The moment it was activated, it had the side effect of hearing an incredibly loud bird sound in your head.</p>, <p><em>Whyeeeeeek!!! Queeeeeeeek!!!</em></p>, <p>To be precise, it mimicked the cry of a heron crying.</p>, <p>“Aaaagh!”</p>, <p>As soon as the spell took effect, Jang Hyeon-deok clutched his ears and jolted awake. The sound was resonating inside his head so the act of covering his ears was useless.</p>, <p>“Are you awake now?”</p>, <p>“Ma-Mage-nim! There’s a strange noise in my head!!”</p>, <p>I was tempted to leave him on his own out of sheer annoyance, but I refrained from doing so because Jang Hyeon-deok hadn’t actually done anything wrong and communication was a priority. With a flick of my finger, I dispelled the magic.</p>, <p>“Are you awake now?”</p>, <p>“What’s… What’s happened here? This mess… And why are your hands like that?”</p>, <p>Still, the fact that he put my worries before his own shows that he is a good young man.</p>, <p>“There’s a lot to explain. How much do you remember?”</p>, <p>“Um….”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok looked around seriously for a moment.</p>, <p>“I remember deciding to come here… But then… Mage-nim…”</p>, <p>“Why?”</p>, <p>“Would you believe me if I said I haven’t been in my right mind since I met you, Mage-nim?”</p>, <p>“There’s no reason I wouldn’t believe that.”</p>, <p>Encouraged by my somewhat lenient response, Jang Hyeon-deok hurriedly poured out his words.</p>, <p>“The moment I saw your mask, things started to feel off! It seems like that mask twisted my mind! I didn’t even know places like this existed before! And that fragment of a mask wasn’t something I found here! I got it from Myeong-sii ahjussi, you know? Seung-jae-ssi and Gil-young ahjussi have one too! Something is terribly wrong! I wasn’t trying to deceive you, Mage-nim; I was being used too!”</p>, <p>In his desperation, Jang Hyeon-deok rambled on about a few more nonsensical things. He mentioned something about an orphanage, his siblings who looked up to him like rabbits, and how he had planned to buy gifts and visit the children at the orphanage who were eagerly waiting for him. If he suddenly stopped showing up without any notice… It seemed that his tendency to blurt out irrelevant things when flustered was a part of his personality and was unrelated to any mind control.</p>, <p>Considering the grim situation in Paju, where fixers, monster hunters, and treasure hunters typically exact their own forms of retribution on those who threaten them….Jang Hyeon-deok’s reaction couldn’t really be deemed overly sensitive. Even I had entertained the thought that the safest course of action might be to slit the unconscious Jang Hyeon-deok’s throat.</p>, <p>“Okay, I get it.”</p>, <p>“Please believe me! I’m truly innocent!”</p>, <p>“Sure, sure. You don’t need to make any more excuses.”</p>, <p>Although I meant for him to just shut up, Jang Hyeon-deok seemed to misinterpret my words to mean something along the lines of “There is no need to make any more excuses; just die, Jang Hyeon-deok.” He clung to me with even more desperation.</p>, <p>“Please! At the very least, let me deliver the shoes I promised to Hyeon-ji…”</p>, <p>“Ah, let go! I said I understand! My back’s hurting!”</p>, <p>“Please, Mage-nim! Spare me!”</p>, <p>I attempted to peel off Jang Hyeon-deok who was clinging to my waist but eventually gave up.</p>, <p>“Alright, Jang Hyeon-deok, I understand. I got it, okay?”</p>, <p>“You believe me!”</p>, <p>“Yes. So, just shut up and take a couple of hits.”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p><em>Whack.</em></p>, <p>I quickly smacked him on the head.</p>, <p>“Ugh… my hand….”</p>, <p>Hitting him with my hand was not the right move, it seems.</p>, <p>I spoke to Jang Hyeon-deok who was holding his head and groaning.</p>, <p>“I intended to hit you twice, but my hand hurts, so I’ll let you off with just one.”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok who was crouching down gave me a puzzled look.</p>, <p>“You’re letting me off?”</p>, <p>“Yes. Let’s call it even with that and leave it be.”</p>, <p>“Really?”</p>, <p>“Yes, but there’s much to be done. Follow me.”</p>, <p>“Ah, understood!”</p>, <p>I led Jang Hyeon-deok to where the dancers’ bodies lay. Jang Hyeon-deok who was confronted with the fascinating yet gruesome sight of golden corpses scattered in a mess recoiled with a look of disgust.</p>, <p>“We agreed to split things fifty-fifty at the beginning.”</p>, <p>“Uh? Yes… we did say that… but… that was before…”</p>, <p>“I’m going to take care of those. Are you going to claim them?”</p>, <p>“…….”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok hesitated to respond. In fact, his expression seemed to convey all he wished to say. Well, his reaction was typical for most people. Even if it were called a treasure, it was an ominous and dreadful object. It was normal to fear a curse leading to death more than to be driven by greed.</p>, <p>Before Jang Hyeon-deok’s eyes, I reached into the abdomen of one of the destroyed dancer’s corpses and tore out the scales.</p>, <p>Even though I was rummaging through the belly of a being that resembled a human, I felt no revulsion or emotional disturbance. The pain emanating from my damaged fingers was, in fact, more distressing.</p>, <p>The entity seemed more like an inanimate object moved by magic than a living creature. It was more fitting to describe it as a device that had stopped working rather than a dead body.</p>, <p>I then extracted something of true importance from within the destroyed dancer’s body.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“As expected, it’s incredibly large. As expected from a servant created directly by a being of the abyss.”</p>, <p>A beautiful round gem sparkling with a golden light.</p>, <p>This was a large magic stone that was difficult to lift with just one hand.</p>, <p>It was an item of tremendous value that couldn’t even be compared to its same weight of gold. It could be sold, or the magical power of the [King in Yellow] within it could be extracted to create a new artifact.</p>, <p>Starting with this one, since there were a total of thirteen dancers, there should be twelve more large magic stones remaining.</p>, <p>“And then there’s that head.”</p>, <p>“Eeek!”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok stepped back with a pale expression on his face. It seemed as though he was going through real-time checks of sanity. Although he managed to maintain his calm, an instinctive aversion seemed to limit his actions.</p>, <p>“I-I’m fine. You don’t have to pay me… no, you don’t have to give me anything. Just… just please send me back.”</p>, <p>“Thank you for that. But no.”</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>“I might not know about other things, but I will pay you. So, load this into the car and take me to Geumchon.”</p>, <p>“Uh… Load this into the car…?”</p>, <p>“Don’t you have something like a cart around? Something with wheels?”</p>, <p>“Well, yes, but…”</p>, <p>“Hurry up and bring your car.”</p>, <p>“But, that’s…”</p>, <p>“Quick! Don’t you want to go home?”</p>, <p>“I-I got it!”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok ran more as if he was trying to escape the situation than to pack this luggage. It seemed impressive how he could run in the dark, but soon enough, Jang Hyeon-deok stumbled and fell. There was a brief commotion as Jang Hyeon-deok, who thought I had a change of heart and attacked him, screamed and begged for mercy. Eventually, I provided him with a magical light source by his side.</p>, <p>Just in case, I watched Jang Hyeon-deok’s retreating figure for a moment. He seemed to be walking cautiously with an awkward posture…. Anyway, I don’t think he would fall again.</p>, <p><em>Well… since we’re firm allies, he won’t run away on his own.</em></p>, <p>I turned my attention back to the corpses of the dancers.</p>, <p>“Tsk… I was going to ask Jang Hyeon-deok to do this, but with him like that, it looks like I’ll have to do it myself.”</p>, <p>The event prepared at the archaeological site concluded, but it seemed my tasks for the day were far from over.</p>, <p>I began to spread my magical power in all directions, using magical vibrations and telekinesis…</p>, <p>[Touch of the Other World]</p>, <p><em>Crack! Crash! Bang!</em></p>, <p>I extracted magic stones from the scattered corpses of the dancers. Once again, golden scales and gems fluttered through the dark site, making the surroundings glitter magnificently.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Over 50 days have passed since I started spending my nights in the world of [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>I had fifty nights, fifty sleeps, and fifty dreams yet not once was I granted a moment of rest.</p>, <p>The dreadful attention and influence sent by the outer gods seeped into my mind…. creating horrifying and bizarre nightmares.</p>, <p>Even now I am dreaming.</p>, <p>An endlessly vast, desolate desert, a massive lake, and beyond it, a towering spire, all under the shadow of a great and majestic city.</p>, <p>And above in the sky, two suns are faintly dimming.</p>, <p>The old spires that stood against the sandstorm for eons and the screams of a fallen city.</p>, <p>And an eerie, burning blue light swimming through the terrible ruins.</p>, <p>“We are watching you.”</p>, <p>Strange whispers.</p>, <p>Endless rows of nameless tombstones stretched out.</p>, <p>From beneath the ruins, strange forms emerged… groaning, howling, and screaming.</p>, <p>From the deep underground, a huge form arose, a monstrous entity whose mere presence was emitting blasphemous malice.</p>, <p>Somewhere, the sound of drums began to echo.</p>, <p>Golden dancers with masks reversed,</p>, <p>and bizarre creatures without eyes, mouths, or souls, danced a strange dance to spread the gospel of the great king.</p>, <p>It was a slow, awkward, and ludicrous dance set to a dreadful music.</p>, <p>“I refused the banquet.”</p>, <p>At the center of it all dwelled a vast and repulsive shadow.</p>, <p>Attached to its huge body were thousands of boneless limbs writhing.</p>, <p>A massive nightmare pulsating with an unfathomable power.</p>, <p>“I merely chose to watch you, visitor from beyond the distant abyss.”</p>, <p>In a language beyond the scope of any world, a great soul was described, one with countless epithets, minds, wills, and incarnations; truly exalted, truly wondrous, truly great, truly wise.</p>, <p>The master of Carcosa, he who dwells in Aldebaran, the who must not be named, the high priest of the sunset, the lord of the sunset, that which lies beneath the lake, the peacock king, the one and infinite great spirit.</p>, <p>The [King in Yellow] is watching over you.</p>, <p>In the skies of Carcosa, the hem of the King’s yellow robe fluttered.</p>, <p>From afar, the song of the Hyades could be heard…</p>, <p>Crackling.</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated. The effects of the nightmare have been nullified.]</p>, <p>“Ah, finally.”</p>, <p>For a while, it seemed the [Living Flame] was repulsed or perhaps the burning madness of the nightmares it sent had quieted down.</p>, <p>Thanks to this, only the [Nightmares of R’lyeh] sent by Cthulhu were repeating, and just when I was starting to get used to them…</p>, <p>The channel of the King in Yellow was added to my nightmare subscription service.</p>, <p>This wasn’t like subscribing to a streaming channel… Every time I got entangled with beings from the abyss, a new nightmare was added.</p>, <p>“I never asked for this crappy streaming…”</p>, <p>[Madness of the Abyss] was preventing any major problems from arising…. but that was a separate issue from feeling filthy.</p>, <p><em>Ugh, makes me sick…</em></p>, <p>Should I hang up a dream catcher or something?</p>, <p><em>I bet if I raised my mental strength stat, I could block this too.</em></p>, <p>It had been three days since I locked myself in my room for a rest after the turmoil with Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>I was contemplating taking the day off as well, but I had promised to meet Tudor.</p>, <p>Eventually, I decided to get up.</p>, <p>That I decided meant… I didn’t actually get up yet.</p>, <p><em>I just can’t seem to leave the bed.</em></p>, <p>Even though I managed to secure 8 points in my health stat, I somehow squandered it which brought me back down to 7 points.</p>, <p>Below 8 points, a person barely meets the minimum capability to function normally. At least 8 points are needed to continue this extreme and perilous life of a fixer.</p>, <p>Not that reaching a health stat of 8 points would bring about a revolutionary change. It would merely return me to my previous state before being dragged into this world, that is, to the level of Kim Shin-hwa, the game addict who used to lie around playing games all day.</p>, <p>Why did I have to come here as a mage… If I had entered as the warrior I was playing just before, I could have done anything with my excessive muscles and surplus stamina.</p>, <p>“Maybe I should just close my eyes and invest in health every time I get a bonus?”</p>, <p>That was not an option.</p>, <p>I had no history of raising health and strength beyond double digits while raising a mage character.</p>, <p><em>What am I thinking? If I have any stats left over after strength, I should be increasing my intelligence by at least one point.</em></p>, <p>I have come to realize that the basis of everything comes from muscles, but it was difficult to go against my set schedule or flow.</p>, <p>I wondered if I could somehow come across a powerful artifact… It would be nice if it just fell out of the sky.</p>, <p>The view of my room, seen from an angle, was a mess.</p>, <p>Gleaming… remnants of corpses and cursed gems that I had gathered with Jang Hyeon-deok at the ruins three days ago were scattered everywhere, along with various knick-knacks and clothes.</p>, <p>It was a horrendous sight.</p>, <p><em>I need to get rid of those things soon…</em></p>, <p>But before even getting up and changing clothes, there was a more pressing preparation for going out.</p>, <p>I stretched out my hand while lying down.</p>, <p><em>Fzzzt…</em></p>, <p>A burst of colorful lights emanated from my fingertips before scattering in all directions.</p>, <p>The door, the windows, and even the walls and ceiling were all covered.</p>, <p>I fortified the flimsy door and windows, applied silence, detection interference, and even bestowed invisibility on the artifacts and gems, along with setting up electric shock and flame spells to activate upon approach.</p>, <p>These were just temporary security measures I could set up immediately.</p>, <p>I felt sick to my stomach because I only ate delivery food all week.</p>, <p>While I’m going out today, I should buy something proper to eat.</p>, <p>I picked up a few gems and chunks of mana stones scattered around my room and stepped outside. As always, I didn’t head towards the main entrance below but towards the rooftop.</p>, <p>It was already late evening outside with the sun tilting towards the horizon.</p>, <p>Buildings of similar height stretched around the one I was standing on, with the landscape of Paju visible beyond them.</p>, <p><em>Is this really another world?</em></p>, <p>Each time I came up here, I fell into similar reflections. Could this really be fake? It seemed too real to call it virtual, and it seemed too similar to reality to call it another world.</p>, <p>As if mocking my thoughts, I could see the tip of Hwangnyongsa Mountain and the giant bronze head of the seated Buddha statue at Hwangnyongsa far beyond the buildings.</p>, <p><em>There’s no such eerie-looking giant Buddha statue in the actual Paju.</em></p>, <p>But the statue in the distance wasn’t the issue.</p>, <p>The mask covering my face was the beginning of the abnormality.</p>, <p>“Haah…”</p>, <p>Right, what’s the point in pondering such thoughts? Let’s just get going.</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>A mage wearing a cursed mask soared into the skies on a magical board. Before I knew it, I had surpassed level 20. The unlocking of second-order magic allowed me to harness an even greater array of spells and incorporate finer details into my posture correction and leaps.</p>, <p>It felt more like an art than a mere trick, as I, along with the board, performed a 360-degree rotation in mid-air… No, it was a feeling. Suddenly, I executed several more rotations in succession before landing smoothly on the ground.</p>, <p>Without the need to push off, I entrusted my body to the skateboard that glided forward while navigating through the dark back alleys of Paju.</p>, <p><em>Today…</em></p>, <p>I had received a message from Tudor last night. She mentioned there was a job at Vasilisa that might interest me, and I had a rough idea of what it could be.</p>, <p>I already completed five requests.</p>, <p>If the game was to follow its predetermined storyline, then that quest would surely come next.</p>, <p>The requests provided by the brokers were different each time, but there were certain tasks that appeared at regular intervals. These were known as fixed requests, and the veteran players of [Cthulhu World] would often decide which broker to work with based not only on their personality and reliability but also on the quality and type of these fixed requests.</p>, <p>While I was heading to Vasilisa with these thoughts in mind, something unexpected occurred.</p>, <p>“Excuse me, just a moment.”</p>, <p>Someone called out to me.</p>, <p><em>Behind me. Who could it be?</em></p>, <p>I suppressed my magical power to make it difficult for anyone nearby to detect me while preparing my spells for immediate deployment before turning around.</p>, <p>Coincidentally, there was an illegally parked car nearby.</p>, <p>So I used this car’s side mirror to check who was behind me</p>, <p>…It was the police.</p>, <p>Though Paju was known to be unlawful, I had been moving around too comfortably until now.</p>, <p>But such an encounter was always a possibility.</p>, <p>Wearing this mask and wandering through the back alleys would definitely look suspicious to anyone.</p>, <p><em>I was just about to address the issue with the mask… What terrible timing.</em></p>, <p>Should I increase my board’s speed and just flee?</p>, <p>No, let’s not. I sensed the presence of several others within my detection range, and among them, some were not ordinary people. They possessed abnormally high levels of magical power just like Lee Chang-hyuk or Kwak Dae-yong.</p>, <p>The police in Paju were formidable enough as they were. Among them, there were irregulars who were far from ordinary.</p>, <p>There was no telling what complications might arise If a chase were to start.</p>, <p>To buy some time, I pretended not to hear anything and turned around while my mask hid my face.</p>, <p>I had no intention of escaping through such an obvious tactic.</p>, <p>While escaping might have been the only option at first-order, second-order offered spells that could help me out. However, even with such spells, it was impossible to use them while facing someone directly.</p>, <p>All I have to do is keep the mask out of the police officer’s sight, even if it’s just for a second.</p>, <p>“Hey, you! Stop right there!”</p>, <p>It seemed my attitude only further provoked the police officer. His previously polite attitude vanished as he raised his voice.</p>, <p>But at that moment, I quickly twisted my body and completely avoided his gaze.</p>, <p>Now was the time. I activated the spell I had prepared in advance.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>[Tangled Identity]</p>, <p>The second-order magic of stealing another’s face requires a medium like a piece of leather to cover the face for use, but I’m already wearing a mask anyway.</p>, <p><em>Uuung-</em></p>, <p>As the sound of the air vibrating around my face reached my ears, the strange shape held by the mask of Carcosa began to twist, and a new face formed over it.</p>, <p>Creating the face was one thing, but the challenge lies in deceiving the person who was looking at me from close range. So I had to erase any sense of alienation in that brief moment.</p>, <p>[Hazy Presence]</p>, <p>[Kind Whisper]</p>, <p>So I hurried to layer on other spells. I subtly diluted the presence of the morphed face to make it less conspicuous and infused my voice with magical charm and a forced familiarity.</p>, <p>“What’s wrong?”</p>, <p>“U-uh… That’s…”</p>, <p>Why did I think this person was suspicious? The officer had that kind of expression on his face.</p>, <p>Human cognitive abilities are more flawed than one might think. Despite having clearly seen a bizarre figure wearing a mask with four eyes just moments before, a simple trick and the right amount of deception made him forget what he had previously seen.</p>, <p><em>That’s why mages can make a living.</em></p>, <p>“No, nothing. My apologies.”</p>, <p>The police officer continued to examine my face with a puzzled expression on his face.</p>, <p>I just added a three-dimensional illusion over the mask, so unless he physically touched my face, he wouldn’t be able to detect anything amiss.</p>, <p>Even more, since I had artificially diminished my presence, no matter how closely he examined my face, it would be difficult to find any distinct personality or features.</p>, <p>The police officer felt slightly embarrassed and slightly confused as he seemed to have forgotten what he was supposed to do next.</p>, <p>“Well, then…”</p>, <p>There was nothing to be gained by prolonging this encounter. It was best to get out of his sight as quickly as possible.</p>, <p>“What are you doing? Aren’t you going to check his ID?”</p>, <p>Suddenly, a sharp voice cut in from behind the police officer.</p>, <p>“Did you not understand me? Check his ID.”</p>, <p>At the same moment, a message window popped up.</p>, <p>[System: ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ trait has been activated.]</p>, <p>Why didn’t you pop up earlier you bastard. If it had appeared sooner, I would have just run away.</p>, <p>“Ah, um… Yes!”</p>, <p>The police officer who came to his senses belatedly looked very nervous.</p>, <p><em>What’s going on?</em></p>, <p>Looking over the police officer’s shoulder towards the source of the voice, I saw a few people approaching.</p>, <p>There were two police officers and a woman dressed in a suit.</p>, <p><em>That woman…</em></p>, <p>What a pain in the a**. The space around her seemed almost warped by the heavy magic I could feel emanating from her.</p>, <p>At this point, a few police officers were the least of my concerns.</p>, <p>It would be ideal to resolve this through talking, but the likelihood of dialogue succeeding was extremely low.</p>, <p>The opponent was just as dangerous and crazy.</p>, <p>“Look! We are in a very dangerous and dark time! How can we ensure the safety of our citizens if you act so carelessly in such a situation?”</p>, <p>A young woman with a sharp demeanor was shouting at the rough and unruly police officers of Paju.</p>, <p>Even at first glance, she had a fierce appearance and voice that suggested that she had a fierce personality.</p>, <p>She gave off the impression of being a swordsman belonging to an organization, and moreover…</p>, <p><em>A pistol inside the suit she’s wearing. Knives on her wrists and waistband? Or perhaps batons? And a few more items besides that.</em></p>, <p>It was difficult to identify exactly what those items were, but they were certainly not ordinary weapons.</p>, <p>The objects exuded a more intense magical power than the magical power emanating from her body. Well, they were discernible beneath her clothes by their shapes.</p>, <p><em>She is carrying around five artifacts.</em></p>, <p>All the detected weapons were artifacts of A-rank or higher, with two of them being S-rank.</p>, <p>The woman commanding the Paju police officers with a flick of her chin was called Yang Seo-ho.</p>, <p>To think I had run into this woman…</p>, <p>I then realized why my Enhanced Vigilance trait had manifested so belatedly.</p>, <p>That woman was a different kind of danger from the usual enemies. If one could somehow fall within the scope of “our citizens” as defined by her, there were few public servants as trustworthy as she was.</p>, <p>However, if one were to fall outside her personal criteria for “our citizens” there were few monsters as dangerous as her.</p>, <p>The fact that my “Enhanced Vigilance” trait had manifested belatedly meant that I had just become someone who didn’t meet Yang Seo-ho’s criteria for “our citizens”.</p>, <p><em>Still, there might be room for dialogue.</em></p>, <p>She looked at me with a feigned smile and said,</p>, <p>“Now passerby-nim? please cooperate with us.”</p>, <p>“Cooperate, you say?”</p>, <p>“Ah, I am an official from the Immigration Bureau. Your movements and clothing are quite… suspicious.”</p>, <p>Although she lowered her voice, her tone was clearly aggressive.</p>, <p>With a nod from her head, the police officers standing behind her slowly approached me.</p>, <p>“Ah, excuse me, sir… but could we conduct a brief check? We would like to verify your ID.”</p>, <p>And there was Yang Seo-ho with a fake smile on her face.</p>, <p>“Lately, there have been too many strange occurrences in Paju. It’s as if things that shouldn’t be in our country are starting to increase again…”</p>, <p>Tudor had mentioned several times that the Immigration Bureau had been intensifying their crackdowns recently. That’s why I’ve been taking secure taxis even for short distances.</p>, <p>The Immigration Bureau.</p>, <p>This is the name of the organization to which Yang Seo-ho belongs, often called the Immigration Bureau, Foreigner Management Bureau, or simply the Management Bureau.</p>, <p>Externally, they are known to crack down on illegal immigrants, but their actual tasks are far more dangerous and secretive.</p>, <p>They are a group of officially recognized people with special abilities operating in South Korea where Cthulhu Mythos disasters occur.</p>, <p>Rather than illegal immigrants from foreign countries, they regulate alien beings that have crossed over from beyond the veil.</p>, <p>And Yang Seo-ho is among the most aggressive and radical figures within this group.</p>, <p><em>Look how her expression is starting to sour already.</em></p>, <p>As I hesitated, her smile quickly vanished from her face.</p>, <p>Yang Seo-ho assumed a posture with her hand on her waist.</p>, <p>While it might seem like an arrogant stance designed to intimidate, she was actually always ready to pull out the artifacts hidden in her waist.</p>, <p>If I made any unnecessary or suspicious movements, she would likely attack without further questioning.</p>, <p><em>What should I do then?</em></p>, <p>Someone of Yang Seo-ho’s caliber would have sensed that I possess more magical power than an average person.</p>, <p>But that was all.</p>, <p>The extent of magical power she detected was only what I had intentionally revealed.</p>, <p>To Yang Seo-ho, I might seem like a mage or a person with special abilities of moderate level, but she had not grasped the full extent of my capabilities.</p>, <p><em>There’s no need for pointless mind games.</em></p>, <p>I calmly pulled out my ID and showed it to the officer.</p>, <p>The officer took out a device that resembled an old-fashioned PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and began to go through some verification processes. After a while, he approached Yang Seo-ho and whispered something to her.</p>, <p>“Hmm, is that so?”</p>, <p>The kind and pretentious smile typical of an official appeared on Yang Seo-ho’s face again.</p>, <p>Just moments before, her expression had been that of a murderer as if she was on the verge of killing me at the slightest provocation.</p>, <p>“Oh, my apologies. It turns out you are a citizen of South Korea.”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>Even though I felt displeased with all these attitudes, I reminded myself that it was just a passing storm.</p>, <p>Moreover, at this moment, getting into a conflict with this woman would serve no good purpose. I decided to endure it a bit longer and I simply kept my mouth shut.</p>, <p>“Do you know that it’s currently a period of intensified crackdown on illegal residents? If you happen to notice anyone acting suspiciously, please contact us.”</p>, <p>After saying this, she handed me a pamphlet that mentioned something about emergency reporting.</p>, <p>The old-fashioned design and font typical of promotional material produced by a government office stood out.</p>, <p>Most of its content resembled guidelines for identifying spies from the ’70s, but it also included some utterly bizarre statements. These were warnings that seemed relevant only in a world where surreal incidents occur.</p>, <p>[1. If a door suddenly appears on a previously blank wall, do not open it under any circumstances and report it to the authorities immediately.</p>, <p>Do not touch the door or put your ear against it to listen for sounds from the other side.</p>, <p>2. If a group of people with whom you have no social or age commonality offers you a chance for a better life, suggests enhancing your intelligence, or proposes immortality, life extension, or a cure for incurable diseases, ignore their offers and report them to the authorities right away.</p>, <p>3. On a rainy day, if a person (often a woman) who is not wearing an umbrella or raincoat suggests walking together, never respond. Facing them or making eye contact can also be dangerous.</p>, <p>4. If a person who was long presumed missing or dead suddenly shows up without any prior contact and knocks on your door…]</p>, <p>In the end, I couldn’t hold back and ended up speaking out.</p>, <p>“It reminds me of a collection of urban legends that used to be popular back in the day…”</p>, <p>Even after hearing what I said, Yang Seo-ho didn’t make any kind of reaction. In fact, she adopted a more serious demeanor.</p>, <p>“The illegal residents these days are far more dangerous than that.”</p>, <p>It’s something I couldn’t say to others, but… this woman seems quite off her rocker.</p>, <p>“Anyway, take care.”</p>, <p>“Yes, I hope we don’t meet again in any strange circumstances.”</p>, <p>Her words were polite but her tone implied a threat, as if encountering her again under unusual conditions would have dire consequences.</p>, <p>She didn’t wait for my response and continued speaking.</p>, <p>“I didn’t bring my equipment today, but usually I carry much more with me.”</p>, <p>Yang Seo-ho’s gaze was cold and detached as she scanned my face.</p>, <p>It was an obsessive and persistent look as if she was trying to etch my face into her memory.</p>, <p>It seemed she had noticed I used some kind of magic but was frustrated not knowing what it was.</p>, <p><em>Go ahead; memorize this face well.</em></p>, <p>The presence of this unremarkable face was fleeting; even if someone committed it to memory, changing it would be simple.</p>, <p>I turned around and checked the consumption of magical power and concentration, as well as other factors.</p>, <p>Considering it was a spur-of-the-moment attempt, the performance was quite satisfactory.</p>, <p>If it could deceive someone as skilled as Yang Seo-ho, it was unlikely anyone other than a fellow mage would notice the illusion cast over my face.</p>, <p><em>This should allow me to maintain my appearance without hindrance, even during combat or other complex activities.</em></p>, <p>There was no need to show a false face to those who already knew me by the mask, but it seemed I could finally abandon the lifestyle of only moving about unseen at night.</p>, <p>I realized I hadn’t wandered outside during daylight for almost two months. For the sake of my physical and mental well-being, it would be beneficial to see the sun occasionally.</p>, <p>“Haah… But I doubt I’ll manage to get up during the day.”</p>, <p>Now that the tension was easing, hunger set in. I glanced at the fully darkened sky for a moment before making up my mind. I’d deal with Vasilisa first, then head in to eat something.</p>, <p>I got on my skateboard once again.</p>, <p>To avoid the possibility of Yang Seo-ho tracking me, I chose not to use magic and instead moved stealthily, rolling my feet quietly as I traveled. I intentionally took the longer route, meandering through the complex back alleys of the Geumchon neighborhood to buy time.</p>, <p>After about 20 minutes of skulking in the shadows, once I was confident I wasn’t being followed, I finally dispelled the magic on my mask.</p>, <p>Now, I was no longer the person with an unremarkable fake face, but Kim Shin-hwa the remarkable masked man.</p>, <p>“I’m a little worried that my attachment to the mask is getting stronger…”</p>, <p>I started wondering if there was a way to cure my obsession with masks as I leaped over several buildings, making my way to the alley where Vasilisa was located.</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>Something about the atmosphere around Vasilisa was off.</p>, <p>A great deal of magical power was pulsating inside. The magical power was moving as if a great commotion was taking place inside. This wasn’t a normal situation.</p>, <p>[System: ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ trait has been activated.]</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>Smash!</em></p>, <p>I could hear the sound of something shattering inside accompanied by what seemed like piercing screams. I couldn’t tell what the sound was because it was muffled by the walls, but it appeared to be the voice of a woman, or perhaps a child, hurling curses in a frenzy.</p>, <p>This marked the second strange event of today. It was baffling, considering it wasn’t even during work hours. Despite my irritation, my heightened senses diligently analyzed the turmoil of magical power within Vasilisa, discerning its intensity, quantity, and direction. Following that, I shifted a step to the side.</p>, <p><em>Bang! Crushh!</em></p>, <p>The front doors of Vasilisa café burst open as if they were about to shatter, revealing a burly man hurled through the air. He landed sprawled on the very spot where I had been standing only moments before.</p>, <p>“Aaaaargh! Collie, you piece of sh*t!”</p>, <p>The man scrambled to his feet and shouted in rage. He was clearly no ordinary citizen of Paju going about his day.</p>, <p>He possessed a notable amount of magical power and was impressively muscular. Although we had never formally introduced ourselves, I was able to recall information from the time I played the game. His fixer name, was it JJ?</p>, <p>He was merely one of the mass-produced NPCs available as an assistant for difficult quests and wasn’t an important character at all.</p>, <p>“Shut that rotten mouth of yours!”</p>, <p>However, the person presumed to have sent him flying possessed a level of magical power that was incomparable to someone like JJ. A chair from inside Vasilisa flew at an incredible speed before striking JJ who was awkwardly standing, and with a cry of “Gwaaah!” JJ was sent flying back again.</p>, <p>Then he lay motionless on the ground as if he were dead.</p>, <p>Of course, my eyes could perceive not just his outward appearance but also the magical power residing within his body, so I could tell that he wasn’t actually dead. It seemed that the woman causing havoc inside had also guessed as much.</p>, <p>“Hey, JJ, you little shit! Just lie there. I’m coming to kill you!”</p>, <p>JJ, who had been sprawled on the ground for a moment, sensed her voice approaching and immediately got up and ran into the darkness of the back alleys of the Geumchon neighborhood. And the one who emerged a step later from the café was… a rather small woman.</p>, <p>Although she was short, she had a flashy appearance that would catch anyone’s eye anywhere.</p>, <p>Her long hair was bleach-blond, and she wore a dazzlingly red leather jacket while holding a ridiculously large zanbato (horse-slaying sword) in one hand.</p>, <p>She harbored a strong and dark magical power as I had sensed beforehand. Upon confirming that JJ had disappeared, she kicked the ground in irritation and cursed.</p>, <p>“Ah, sh*t. That sneaky bastard!”</p>, <p>Then she hurled aimless curses into the darkness of the back alley.</p>, <p>“If you show that ugly face of yours in Vasilisa again, I’ll slice you up! You’d better find yourself a broker other than Tudor!”</p>, <p>Tough talk. Her name is… I’m not sure. Her real name was never explicitly revealed in the game. However, her fixer name is Curtain Call. She’s a fixer I’ve seen a few times coming and going from Vasilisa, but never had any direct dealings with.</p>, <p>Still seemingly not over her anger, she did a quick glance around and then yelled at me.</p>, <p>“Who are you! Why are you here?”</p>, <p>“I’m a customer.”</p>, <p>“…. Ah, right, this is Vasilisa. Sorry.”</p>, <p>Before I could even decide whether to feel offended or not, she lowered her head to 90 degrees and apologized. It was hard to remain angry when I was faced with such a response. So, I just shrugged and said.</p>, <p>“I was about to enter the shop; could you move aside?”</p>, <p>“I’m going in too. Excuse me then.”</p>, <p>After saying that, Curtain Call sheathed her giant zanbato and headed into Vasilisa…</p>, <p>“Collie! Bring a chair!”</p>, <p>“Ah, got it!”</p>, <p>…and then following Tudor’s call, she hurried back out, grabbed a chair, and darted back in. As befitting a powerful warrior, her movements were almost like the charge of a wild boar. I stepped aside for a moment to avoid her path, which must have looked odd to Curtain Call.</p>, <p>While Curtain Call hurried to fetch a chair, she noticed me standing awkwardly and remarked,</p>, <p>“If you’re a customer, why are you standing over there like that?”</p>, <p>“Because if you hit me, I could die.”</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>Curtain Call looked puzzled for a moment, glanced up at my mask, and then examined me from head to toe before a look of realization dawned on her face. It was a look that seemed to say, <em>Oh, you were born with a pitifully weak body.</em></p>, <p>“Ah, I see. Sorry about that. And sorry for shouting at you out of the blue earlier!”</p>, <p>With those final words, Curtain Call disappeared into the store with a chair in her hand.</p>, <p>“Hmm… Was that her character?”</p>, <p>I was lost in thought while tapping my mask with my finger before entering Vasilisa.</p>, <p>Despite the recent commotion, the inside of Vasilisa seemed surprisingly normal.</p>, <p>Of course, it wasn’t exactly the Vasilisa of an ordinary day.</p>, <p>A broken chair, possibly thrown by Curtain Call, lay in a corner, along with a shattered cup and a table split as if by an axe. These seemed to be the remnants of Curtain Call’s earlier rampage. The damaged furniture was just left unattended with no one to clean it up. How did this commotion arise in the first place?</p>, <p>It couldn’t be called a safe or quiet place since it was frequented by rough mercenaries and fixers, yet it was a spot run by the overly charismatic Tudor. Events like “tavern brawls” were almost unheard of in Vasilisa.</p>, <p><em>Ah, now that I think about it, there’s one more strange thing.</em></p>, <p>Yes, Tudor who led a leisurely life was not the type to clean up such messes. This was because there was someone else who took care of the major and minor affairs of Vasilisa as a café, aside from its business as a brokerage for fixers.</p>, <p>But he was nowhere to be seen.</p>, <p>Orb, the barista with the monitor head who could be considered the icon of the cafe, was not here.</p>, <p>In his place, or for whatever reason, a bald mercenary leaning casually against the counter greeted me.</p>, <p>“Hey, long time no see. How have you been?”</p>, <p>It was Kang Il-sam, the fixer who had once asked me to join his team. His fixer name was Thirteen.</p>, <p>“Ah, but what’s all this chaos? Where’s Orb? And Tudor?”</p>, <p>“Orb stepped out for a bit on an errand for Tudor. He should be back soon. And Tudor is…”</p>, <p>He gestured over his shoulder to a table.</p>, <p>At one table in the corner, I saw the small fixer called Curtain Call from earlier and she was having a conversation with Tudor.</p>, <p>Although I couldn’t hear their conversation, the sight of the tall Tudor whispering something gently to the much shorter Curtain Call resembled, at first glance, a young mother admonishing her child for her misbehavior.</p>, <p>However, Curtain Call’s bizarre behavior completely shattered that image.</p>, <p>With a look of dissatisfaction on her face, Curtain Call listened to Tudor’s words while… chewing on a cup?</p>, <p>This was no metaphor or joke. She was literally crunching on a glass cup while making a grinding sound.</p>, <p>What in the world? Why was she eating a cup? I mean, it’s none of my business if someone decides to chew on glass cups or slice up tables. The real question is, why was “that person” eating a cup?</p>, <p>For a more accurate clarification, I turned to Thirteen and asked.</p>, <p>“That… Collie, her name is Curtain Call, right?”</p>, <p>“Huh? You know her?”</p>, <p>“Well, only seen her face in passing.”</p>, <p>“Well, Collie is quite well-known. Most fixers in this line of work are a bit weird in the head, but that woman is something else entirely.”</p>, <p>It wasn’t because she was famous that I knew her, but rather because she was a named NPC memorable enough to remember her name and face. However, I felt there was no need to talk to him about that detail. I simply nodded along appropriately to encourage Thirteen’s misunderstanding.</p>, <p>“She began showering Orb with an overwhelming display of affection a while back. But today, she seemed somewhat off with Orb missing. Amidst all this, JJ unnecessarily picked a fight with her and that led to the earlier commotion.”</p>, <p>“What’s with that bizarre setup?”</p>, <p>“Hahaha! It’s quite unique, isn’t it?”</p>, <p>Thirteen laughed it off and moved on but this wasn’t something to be taken lightly.</p>, <p>Something was off. This was different from what I knew. Such a peculiar setup would have been easy to remember, yet none of this was part of the Curtain Call I was familiar with.</p>, <p>The only details I knew were her small size compared to her abnormally large weapon and a somewhat ambiguous setup seemingly designed to appeal to certain gamers.</p>, <p>There was nothing about her expressing affection for Orb… or chewing on glass cups.</p>, <p>“Did she always have this rare… food preference?”</p>, <p>“Hmm, not really… but things got a bit weird since she fell hard for Orb.”</p>, <p>“When did that start?”</p>, <p>“Let’s see… about… a month or two ago? I don’t know where she came from or what she did but it seems like she came back with a few new abilities and a touch of madness.”</p>, <p>Changes in personality, taste, and eating habits are not uncommon for fixers who work in the darkness of Paju, where beings of madness and abyss run rampant.</p>, <p>Among the people I had encountered, there were dramatic transformations like Jang Hyeon-deok, who went from being a professional driver of a secure taxi to a top-tier medium, and Lee Chang-hyuk, who turned into a monster after ingesting bodily fluids sprayed by an abyssal being. There was also Lee Seon-bin, who went mad overnight and had to be admitted to a special psychiatric ward.</p>, <p>And judging from Thirteen’s attitude of dismissing her affection for Orb as madness, it seemed that Curtain Call had experienced a temporary distortion upon discovering Orb’s absence from Vasilisa today. It appeared that JJ was an unintended victim caught up in this distortion …</p>, <p>When I shared my deductions with Thirteen, he agreed with a laugh.</p>, <p>“That’s almost right. But it’s not like JJ was an innocent victim. That guy has been a jerk from the start; it was only a matter of time before he got what was coming to him.”</p>, <p>Kuhahaha. Thirteen then burst into laughter. He was about to transition into a series of humorous anecdotes related to JJ, but I was more concerned about something else.</p>, <p>“So, this happened about two months ago? Are you sure?”</p>, <p>“It started precisely after you came here.”</p>, <p>Thirteen and I were in the middle of a conversation when Tudor interjected. It seemed she had just finished her talk with Curtain Call. Thirteen smoothly transitioned to address Tudor’s sudden involvement.</p>, <p>“Ah, right. It was around that time I believe.”</p>, <p>“Of course, it’s nothing to do with him personally. The coincidence in timing is just that, a coincidence.”</p>, <p>Despite Tudor’s words, there was a peculiar expression on her face. She was secretly looking at my mask with a serious expression that I rarely saw on her face…</p>, <p>“It somehow sounds like you don’t quite believe it’s just a coincidence?”</p>, <p>“No, I truly think it is a coincidence. But it’s not just Collie who started acting strangely around the time you arrived here.”</p>, <p>“There are others who’ve become strange as well?”</p>, <p>Tudor nodded slightly, but Thirteen seemed to have a slightly different opinion.</p>, <p>“That said, cases like Collie’s aren’t really common. Besides, such changes are almost an occupational hazard for us fixers; it happens more often than you’d think.”</p>, <p>He had a point… However, I couldn’t help but feel uneasy. Could it be that the game’s settings have been continually changing since I came to this world?</p>, <p>If a change that has occurred once continues to affect other things, and the affected things start to cause new events… It meant that the knowledge I had acquired through the game could become useless.</p>, <p>For example, one of the reasons I entered into a contract with Tudor was because I had learned through gameplay that she was a broker with a 100% trust rating who would never betray me. But what if that information became twisted and unreliable?</p>, <p>I would be wandering with zero knowledge in this chaotic world.</p>, <p><em>No, such thoughts are utterly pointless.</em></p>, <p>Didn’t I decide to twist the game’s setting anyway? Whether Tudor betrayed me or the locations of the artifacts I knew about changed, all that awaited me if I were to follow the game’s flow was a disastrous ending.</p>, <p>It was more important to investigate and verify the changes. Starting with Curtain Call. And it was also necessary to check on others who were thought to have caused these changes.</p>, <p><em>Because these changes themselves could be the clues I need to escape this world.</em></p>]\n",

            "[<p>“Hmm, you know dear.”</p>, <p>Tudor leaned casually against the counter with a subtle smile on her face. Her long hair was cascading down in a glittering display.</p>, <p>“Fixers usually tend to share a lot of information to increase their own value. The same goes for your information.”</p>, <p>“But?”</p>, <p>“But just like with the information beneath your mask, the personal details fixers prefer to keep private can be quite costly. And sometimes, people became targets for attacks just because they started digging into such matters.”</p>, <p>I understand what she’s implying. I could pay to have this matter looked into but I should be prepared for potential conflicts.</p>, <p>“Well, I’m not planning to make such a request right now. Actually, I came here to take on a request instead.”</p>, <p>“Hmm, good, good. There happens to be an interesting request that might just suit your taste… Thirteen, could you cover for me here for a moment?”</p>, <p>Perhaps because he was such a regular, Thirteen responded with a chuckle and a nod of understanding. However, it seemed he had no intention of taking on the barista role; instead, he simply leaned against one side of the counter and looked to be planning to either shoo away any customers or tell them to wait.</p>, <p>Tudor saw this and gave Thirteen a slight nod before gesturing for me to follow her into the office.</p>, <p>“And there’s a proposition for you.”</p>, <p>“What kind of proposition?”</p>, <p>“That….How about we discuss that privately inside, just between the two of us?”</p>, <p>Tudor said with a wink.</p>, <p>As soon as we entered the office and sat down, Tudor began by addressing the settlement.</p>, <p>Despite having been through a whirlwind of adventures, including defeating the dancers in Tanhyeon with Jang Hyeon-deok, meeting the King in Yellow, and extracting the gold from the dancers, the last real quest I officially completed involved eliminating ghouls and a ghoul shaman in the basement of that apartment complex in Munsan.</p>, <p>“As I mentioned before, Yeonam Construction is very satisfied. It seems the cleanup was very thorough, wasn’t it?”</p>, <p>“I didn’t do a sloppy job.”</p>, <p>“Right, and that’s why there was a bonus.”</p>, <p>“A bonus?”</p>, <p>“Yes, a bonus. Just a moment.”</p>, <p>Tudor paused momentarily and tapped away at her keyboard. The sight of a witch wearing a wide-brimmed cone hat conducting a bank transfer on a computer screen….It was funny no matter how many times I saw it.</p>, <p>“There, transfer complete. Do you have a banking app on your smartphone? Or rather, are you familiar with the concept of applications?”</p>, <p>“…I know them.”</p>, <p>“The image of a mage hidden behind such a mask and managing bank transactions on a smartphone is funny every time I see it.”</p>, <p>Whether Tudor read my mind or it was merely a coincidence, I felt somewhat caught off guard. But I played along with Tudor’s joke while checking my smartphone.</p>, <p>One hundred and eighty million won.</p>, <p>Given that my account originally held exactly one hundred million won, it was eighty million won that had been deposited this time.</p>, <p>“That’s quite generous. A bonus of thirty million won is indeed something to be thankful for.”</p>, <p>“You don’t sound happy at all though.”</p>, <p>“No, I’m happy. Money is always good.”</p>, <p>Although I spent nearly a week bedridden, I worked one night and earned eighty million won.</p>, <p>It seemed I was beginning to become insensitive to the value of money.</p>, <p>My indifference was partly due to the cursed gems that were currently piled up in my room. They were difficult to dispose of, but if I could, they would be worth several times the amount of money currently in my bank account.</p>, <p>“If a mage of your caliber was interested in money, you wouldn’t be taking risky fixer jobs; you’d be doing something else.”</p>, <p>“Well, I won’t deny that.”</p>, <p>“What would it take to please you, I wonder?”</p>, <p>Tudor said this as she took a half-reclined position on the desk while looking up at me. Though I sometimes forget, her beauty stat is a 20. It’s considered transcendental. If it weren’t for my magic talent and some other traits that came with it, if I was still the ordinary twenty-something working from home Kim Shin-hwa from before coming to this world, I would have been completely frozen in my place and unable to utter a single word.</p>, <p>“For me, the story you told me yesterday is enough. It’s a request I’m genuinely interested in.”</p>, <p>“Hmm, alright. Since we’re done talking about money, shall we move on to discussing the new job?”</p>, <p>With that, Tudor handed me a thick file.</p>, <p>When I flipped through the cover and checked his first page, I saw a photo attached.</p>, <p>The photo depicted an old hospital surrounded by numerous trees, with a very large mountain visible in the background.</p>, <p>A hospital, trees, and a mountain.</p>, <p>Identifying the location based solely on these keywords was no easy task, yet I recognized the mountain in the photo. It was a place I had visited several times throughout the game.</p>, <p>It was Gamaksan Mountain, the tallest mountain in Paju.</p>, <p>And there, set against this mountain, was the dilapidated and aged abandoned hospital.</p>, <p><em>It finally came out.</em></p>, <p>I had been waiting for this.</p>, <p>This was it.</p>, <p>This very reason was one among many for why I specifically chose Tudor out of the numerous brokers operating in Paju.</p>, <p>The first fixed quest provided by Tudor.</p>, <p>[The Abandoned Hospital of Gamaksan].</p>, <p>From the outside, this building might look merely like an abandoned structure that had lost its owner, but if you look closely, you can find something odd about it. The neglect was only superficial.</p>, <p>For a place supposedly left to decay, the windows were too clean, and the glimpses of the interior seen through the windows were too orderly.</p>, <p>At this point, I wanted to declare that I knew enough and rush off to Gamaksan Mountain, but that would be getting ahead of myself. Given the already present subtle doubts in Tudor’s manner towards me, I couldn’t act as if I knew everything about a job I was seeing for the first time.</p>, <p>So I had to talk to Tudor about the request.</p>, <p>“Looks like a rundown hospital, doesn’t it? Where is this place?”</p>, <p>Tudor peered into my mask with a curious smile. What is she thinking? Soon Tudor’s mouth opened.</p>, <p>“This is a place called Gamaksan Mountain. Are you familiar with it?”</p>, <p>“I’ve heard of the mountain; that’s about it. So?”</p>, <p>“It’s the tallest mountain in Paju. Besides that, it’s a mountain rich with resources for mages and psychics, so it might be worth exploring while you’re there.”</p>, <p>Indeed, in the world of [Cthulhu World], Gamaksan was known for such traits. If you wandered around carefully, you could even find elixirs and sites that enhance magical power alongside several altars for the descent of spirits and mythical beings.</p>, <p>When I nonchalantly nodded my head, Tudor continued speaking slowly.</p>, <p>“On the outside, it’s just an old abandoned building, but in reality, it’s still being maintained by its owner. There was even an incident where a ghost stories streamer was trying to explore the abandoned building but he was caught and chased away by the building manager.”</p>, <p>“That’s funny. A building like this has a full-time manager guarding it?”</p>, <p>Tudor smiled at my remark.</p>, <p>“Exactly, the reason this building looks like it’s ruined is because the owner wanted it to look that way.”</p>, <p>“There must be something valuable hidden inside, then?”</p>, <p>“But recently, a problem arose. Some newcomers have suddenly occupied the abandoned hospital where that precious thing is hidden under the pretext of exercising lien rights.”</p>, <p>Lien rights. This is a common occurrence in real life, but in the [Cthulhu World], a special setting was added to it. For example, like what’s written in this file folder…</p>, <p>“It’s written here that these aren’t just newcomers; they’re a force composed of psychics and mutants.”</p>, <p>“Right. While there is a bit of a tangle in the legal rights, these folks aren’t genuinely entitled to exercise any lien rights; they’re merely thugs.”</p>, <p>“It seems we’re in a situation that can’t be resolved through law and common sense, then?”</p>, <p>“Indeed, a team was sent from elsewhere before, but none have returned. That’s how the story unfolds. And so, after much circling, they’ve come to this point. The fee for the job is 120 million Won.”</p>, <p>With 180 million in the account, adding 120 million would make it exactly 300 million, wouldn’t it?</p>, <p>As Tudor had pointed out earlier, the amount didn’t particularly excite me. What concerned me more was whether this was the end of it.</p>, <p>The reason I was waiting for the [Abandoned Hospital of Gamaksan] wasn’t because of money, so it wouldn’t matter if this was all there was to it…</p>, <p>But the content of the [Abandoned Hospital of Gamaksan] that I remembered and the contents of the request when it was linked to Tudor didn’t end there. I acted like I was wondering if there was something more that I hadn’t caught onto yet and asked Tudor.</p>, <p>“Is that all? Just go and knock out everyone I see there?”</p>, <p>Sure enough, Tudor winked at me and continued.</p>, <p>“Haha, if it were just a simple eviction request, there would be many others besides you to handle it.”</p>, <p>Yes, it had to be this way. The quest harbored several more pieces of hidden information.</p>, <p>When I nodded my head and showed interest, Tudor continued speaking with a proud expression on her face.</p>, <p>“After taking on this request, I couldn’t shake off this feeling… So, before introducing it to you, I decided to dig a little deeper.”</p>, <p>“Seems there’s some hidden information, then?”</p>, <p>“Exactly. The client provided overly detailed information about the psychics here. Ah, that information is attached towards the end of the document. Anyway, ahem. But for all that, all the people mentioned here were faces I didn’t recognize.”</p>, <p>Though I already knew all this content, the way she presented it made it engaging.</p>, <p>“Hmm, unknown faces? And then?”</p>, <p>“Upon further investigation, it turned out that this place was never a hospital to begin with.”</p>, <p>Tudor declared this shocking revelation as if announcing a major discovery. That’s right. This wasn’t a hospital, but a research facility. A laboratory that was secretly conducting human experiments.</p>, <p>And in Paju, there’s only one group famous for such deeds.</p>, <p>“This is one of the secret research facilities under the auspices of Helistic.”</p>, <p>Yes, them.</p>, <p>This hospital in Gamaksan was similar to the secret research facility where I had awakened.</p>, <p>“The mutants and psychics occupying the hospital are actually test subjects who underwent unique procedures at that laboratory. That said, they are far from ordinary individuals.”</p>, <p>When I signed a contract with Tudor, I made it clear that I would not engage in affairs involving ordinary people.</p>, <p>And just like Tudor said, these were neither ordinary citizens nor innocent victims. Most of Helistic’s test subjects were generally criminals or death row inmates much like Lee Chang-hyuk.</p>, <p>These were people who led such shitty lives that they voluntarily participated in the experiments for the opportunity to strengthen their bodies. Beating up such scoundrels was something I could do without hesitation.</p>, <p>“Hmm, alright. Let’s proceed.”</p>, <p>[Quest accepted!</p>, <p>&lt;Base Capture Quest: The Abandoned Hospital in Gamaksan&gt;</p>, <p>Subdue all the psychics occupying the abandoned hospital and restore the facility to a ‘safe’ condition.</p>, <p>Remaining Targets: 0/58</p>, <p>Reward: 750,000 XP + 180,000,000 Won</p>, <p>Failure Penalty: Death]</p>, <p>The quest details became clear. The mission would be complete once all 58 test subjects were subdued.</p>, <p>Subduing 58 test subjects… It wasn’t impossible, but it certainly wouldn’t be easy. Although there were far fewer of them compared to ghouls, these people were not mindless creatures that charged forward. Moreover, among them were individuals as troublesome as the ghoul shaman.</p>, <p>But there was a compelling reason for me to undertake this quest.</p>, <p>If things went smoothly, this quest could potentially unravel some of the mysteries of this world that had been plaguing me. Even if that were not the case, there were items that could only be obtained from this place.</p>, <p>When I was about to get up with these thoughts in mind, Tudor held me back.</p>, <p>“Dear, may I make a proposition before you leave?”</p>, <p>“A proposition? Oh, right, you said something like that earlier.”</p>, <p>“I had reserved the request especially for you, but someone showed interest in this mission before you arrived today.”</p>, <p>“And?”</p>, <p>“How about you two team up for this? I think you’ll like it.”</p>, <p>“Like it? Why would you think that?”</p>, <p>“Because the fixer I’m about to introduce to you is this person.”</p>, <p>Tudor handed me a photo.</p>, <p>This was a frontal photo of a fixer.</p>, <p>Bleached long hair, a bright red leather jacket, a small face whose age is hard to guess, and a huge zanbato sword that seemed like it came out of manhwa.</p>, <p>“That’s Curtain Call.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>A confident smile appeared on Tudor’s face.</p>, <p>You were curious about Collie, weren’t you? Instead of digging for her information from behind the scenes, how about meeting her in person to see for yourself? Tudor didn’t say a word, but her expression seemed to convey that very suggestion.</p>, <p>It didn’t feel like she was trying to manipulate the situation from a higher position. The thought crossed my mind that maybe I was being overly generous in my interpretation because of Tudor’s high charm score, but I decided to let it slide this time.</p>, <p>“It’s not just talk. Ever since Collie’s tastes changed, the nature of the requests she takes on has shifted too.”</p>, <p>“What do you mean the nature of her requests has changed?”</p>, <p>“Since she arrived here, or rather… After Lee Chang-hyuk went on such a rampage, Collie has somehow become obsessively interested in taking on any request related to the Helistic company, regardless of the type.”</p>, <p>“Related to Helistic?”</p>, <p>“Yes. She started accepting all requests related to Helistic without considering whether they were beneficial or harmful for Helistic.”</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>That’s interesting. If her goal was simply to harm Helistic, there would be no reason to take on this request. But she wants to participate just because it’s related to Helistic?</p>, <p>“If we bring her along this time, we might be able to find out what triggered this change in her.”</p>, <p>I tapped my mask with my finger for a moment before responding.</p>, <p>“Understood. I’ll discuss it with Curtain Call.”</p>, <p>“Ha, good. Then I’ll make preparations for that.”</p>, <p>“What about the day of action?”</p>, <p>“Helistic seems to want us to go immediately, but we need to coordinate with Collie… How about in two days?”</p>, <p>After considering what I needed to prepare, I replied.</p>, <p>“In two days then. Contact me once the arrangements are finalized.”</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>There was a mountain of things to do in preparation for the quest, and it wasn’t easy to handle everything swiftly due to my accumulated fatigue and my deteriorating health.</p>, <p>However, I managed to finish the preparations without any major issues and arrived at the meeting place near Gamaksan mountain.</p>, <p>Gamaksan mountain is so vast that it’s counted among the five great mountains of Gyeonggi Province.</p>, <p>It’s also known in the real world for its strong spiritual energy.</p>, <p>This is why it’s considered an important location even in [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p><em>There are as many as four main event-level quests related to Gamaksan mountain.</em></p>, <p>If you include the passing-through chain quests and side quests, they’re too numerous to count.</p>, <p>Tudor had casually mentioned stopping by Gamaksan mountain to find something beneficial for a mage, but the quest we were about to undertake [The Abandoned Hospital of Gamaksan mountain] was merely a brief exploration of the mountain.</p>, <p><em>I remember there was also a quest to beat up a fanatic trying to summon an outer god at one of those peaks of Gamaksan mountain.</em></p>, <p>That was a dreadful quest that required climbing up and down the mountain several times.</p>, <p>Haah, I really don’t want to do that quest… But if left alone, they end up summoning an outer god called the [Predator of the Mountains] which would cause complete chaos.</p>, <p>It’s something that I’ll eventually have to deal with at some point.</p>, <p>Maybe I should go ahead and smash them up like I did with the [Descendants of Fomalhaut]?</p>, <p>Well, that’s a problem for another day.</p>, <p>Today, there’s no need to venture deep into Gamaksan mountain.</p>, <p>The location of the abandoned hospital was toward the southwest of Gamaksan mountain, in the direction of Mugeon-ri. A short climb up the mountain trail leads right to it.</p>, <p>Because we intentionally left late at night, it was already completely dark.</p>, <p>The grass grew densely around the unpaved road and the damp scent of wood tickled my nostrils.</p>, <p>The noisy cries of insects and the chilly air contributed to the atmosphere.</p>, <p>And there, the eerie sight of the abandoned hospital completed the horror-genre ambiance.</p>, <p>It was indeed a spine-chilling place.</p>, <p>Just by walking around with a camera, you can easily film a B horror movie.</p>, <p>And the silhouette of the fixer standing in the darkness halfway to the hospital would definitively mark that film as the epitome of Bs.</p>, <p>I had thought this before, but her character design was still incredibly unique.</p>, <p>A short stature, short limbs proportioned to that height, and a youthful face. This information alone was menacing. Yet she did not stop there.</p>, <p>Her long hair was bleach-blond, she wore a shiny red leather jacket, and in one hand, she casually held a huge zanbato sword (a horse-slaying sword).</p>, <p>For today, just this one day, I was partnered with a temporary ally known as Curtain Call.</p>, <p>“Ah, Kim Shin-hwa. You’re late! Late, Kim Shin-hwa!”</p>, <p>“I’m not late. You’re just early.”</p>, <p>“Shouldn’t you have come earlier?”</p>, <p>“Maybe. But that thing…”</p>, <p>“That thing?”</p>, <p>What Curtain Call was holding in her other hand that wasn’t holding the zanbato sword was a large piece of metal that I think used to be a spoon… And the reason I said I think it used to be a spoon is…</p>, <p>“Are you eating that?”</p>, <p>“Yes.”</p>, <p><em>Crunch, munch. Gnash, gnash.</em></p>, <p>I’ll say it again: this is a very temporary team. I have no plans to work with Curtain Call after today. Therefore… I need to gather as much information as possible today.</p>, <p>“Why?”</p>, <p>“Why?”</p>, <p>“Why are you eating that?”</p>, <p>“Because I can eat it?”</p>, <p>I wanted to stop asking questions. What kind of conversation was this, anyway?</p>, <p>Though Curtain Call’s responses were devoid of any real substance or meaning, the movement of magical power around her body provided much more information. The flow of her magical power was peculiar.</p>, <p>It seemed merely eccentric behavior but she was actually absorbing energy rapidly from the spoon… that is, from the metallic organic material.</p>, <p>Even though her seemingly specific design choices in the game were targeting a certain audience, the Curtain Call I knew was a strong warrior. She possessed great strength and a few support abilities, but she had never displayed this type of power before.</p>, <p>It seemed difficult to ascertain her abilities in this state. I wished I could see her in action.</p>, <p>“Tudor seems to like you a lot, Kim Shin-hwa.”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>“All this talk of dual contracts and such, I would have been fine with the usual people I worked with. But she kept making excuses and eventually paired you with me.”</p>, <p>Though she was talking casually, her expression was full of dissatisfaction as if she wasn’t pleased with the current situation.</p>, <p>“Are you unhappy because it’s me?”</p>, <p>“No. I don’t care who I work with, as long as I can feast on those things.”</p>, <p>“Those things? Are you talking about the test subjects or Helistic? Which one are you talking about?”</p>, <p>It seemed my response was not to her liking, as Curtain Call furrowed one brow and glanced up at me briefly before stuffing the remnants of her spoon into her mouth and starting to walk in the direction of the abandoned hospital.</p>, <p>“Everything that Helistic has touched.”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>“I’m going to destroy it all. Everything, everything, everything.”</p>, <p>Her reaction seemed to carry a personal vendetta, but it was too intense to be simply chalked up to a mere grudge.</p>, <p>“Hmph. Anyway, Kim Shin-hwa, the information you talked about yesterday, that was true, right?”</p>, <p>“Of course.”</p>, <p>“So, are we really going ahead with that bullsh*t plan you mentioned?”</p>, <p>Bullsh*t plan, she said… I had a separate conversation with Curtain Call when we met yesterday.</p>, <p>This hospital, or more precisely, Helistic’s secret research facility harbors a secret basement unknown to others.</p>, <p>Well, it’s akin to the secret research facility I was part of before. There, they held human samples in cryogenic sleep. And I think one of those samples might have been me…</p>, <p>Such a place exists here as well. And I’m interested in the items that are going to be there.</p>, <p>And while I wasn’t exactly sure what she was interested in, Curtain Call showed an interest in that place too.</p>, <p>“Well, if you don’t like it, you can still turn back now.”</p>, <p>“No. Tudor said you’re someone to look forward to, so I’ll give you a chance, Kim Shin-hwa.”</p>, <p>I found her logic hard to follow, but it was a relief she was somehow convinced.</p>, <p>Curtain Call continued moving without pause, and I had to accompany her to the planned destination as well.</p>, <p>The distance wasn’t long, but I quickly grew tired due to the penalty trait [Decreased Stamina].</p>, <p>Moreover, it was a dark mountain path without any reliable lighting.</p>, <p>The weather was chilly, yet before I knew it, the back of my neck was damp with sweat.</p>, <p><em>Phew, damn it. I can already see that my health has decreased.</em></p>, <p>I wanted to ride the board I was carrying, but moving stealthily with it on an unpaved path would be difficult. At least I was somewhat fortunate that the magical power wrapped around my body kept the bugs at bay.</p>, <p>“Even for a mage, don’t you think you neglect physical exercise too much?”</p>, <p>“It’s not like you’re healthy because of exercise anyway, right?”</p>, <p>“If you weren’t born lucky, you should at least exercise.”</p>, <p>No comeback for that. Damn it.</p>, <p>“We’re almost there.”</p>, <p>Finally, we reached our destination. The front of the hospital was blocked by a tall fence, yet the main gate had been completely destroyed.</p>, <p>Well, here we are at the abandoned hospital we were aiming for.</p>, <p>Curtain Call, hidden in the shadows beneath the fence, was slowly drawing her oversized sword from its sheath. Given that the sword was disproportionately large compared to her arm length, her method of drawing it was less like a swift unsheathing and more like clumsily fishing it out.</p>, <p>In the meantime, I raised my head to survey the area beyond the fence.</p>, <p>The hospital was a large three-story building.</p>, <p>It was strangely situated in the middle of a forest with no human habitation nearby, but it had been constructed under the guise of serving as a hospital.</p>, <p>The building was a typical square-shaped structure, white in color, with a green cross emblem on the sign.</p>, <p><em>What kind of name is that?</em></p>, <p>I hadn’t paid much attention when I saw it in the game, but there was a sign next to the hospital that read [Gamaksan Hospital].</p>, <p>However, the outwardly old-fashioned and neglected appearance was all a facade.</p>, <p>The official name of this building was [Ga-5060 Secret Research Facility] and it was a dreadful place where Helistic conducted human experiments.</p>, <p>It had now become a site of conflict where the subjects of those experiments had risen up and were staging a sit-in protest.</p>, <p>Except for the first floor all the lights were off, casting the building in deep darkness and the atmosphere was as silent as a grave.</p>, <p>The dark night sky covered in clouds that obscured even the moon, the lukewarm breeze meandering through the air, and the fishy smell of blood mixed with the wind.</p>, <p>“Look, there are still signs of the team that came before us.”</p>, <p>Curtain Call who was hidden in the shadows of the fence pointed towards the parking lot beyond the barrier.</p>, <p>A 1-ton truck and two cars were left abandoned inside the hospital’s walls.</p>, <p>“W.G., that’s the Wild Guns’ sub-team, right?”</p>, <p>“Idiots relying on sheer numbers. They probably barged in without any real plan and got wiped out.”</p>, <p>“Well, their fate doesn’t really concern our mission.”</p>, <p>It didn’t matter. Curtain Call seemed to agree with my words and nodded her head nonchalantly before gesturing toward the interior.</p>, <p>“Alright. Let’s get moving, Kim Shin-hwa; let’s go.”</p>, <p>She had a peculiar way of speaking.</p>, <p>Though the details were largely omitted, we had already laid out a rough plan back at Vasilisa, so I began to carry out the actions desired by Curtain Call without much hesitation.</p>, <p>In truth, it wasn’t that we had devised an extraordinarily elaborate plan.</p>, <p>[Trap Detection]</p>, <p>[Magic Detection]</p>, <p>[Invisibility Detection]</p>, <p>[Infrared Vision]</p>, <p>[Remote Detection]</p>, <p>These detection spells had almost become habitual for me to activate. Checking for traps was a necessity. Like a radar, my magical detection abilities spread out in all directions. Though there was a risk that enemies capable of using magic, albeit at a lower level than mine, might detect my spells….</p>, <p><em>Well, there’s no one among the test subjects here capable of that.</em></p>, <p>Nothing particularly unusual was detected by the spells.</p>, <p>First, I assessed the condition of the hospital’s first floor.</p>, <p>A barricade had been set up at the entrance of the hospital.</p>, <p>It was a makeshift construction that was hastily piled up with hospital equipment, chairs, and desks.</p>, <p>Though it was a crude construction, the barricade was bristling with sharpened metal pipes protruding aggressively through its gaps.</p>, <p>Beyond the barricade and windows, the test subjects who had taken over the hospital were hiding. However, my enhanced senses detected their positions more accurately than sight could have.</p>, <p>Each of the subjects caught by my detection spells bore bizarre forms.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>There was one with a tail.</p>, <p>Another had four arms.</p>, <p>And there was one whose legs had an extra joint each.</p>, <p>It was a place designed to artificially create monstrous beings just like what Lee Chang-hyuk had transformed into.</p>, <p>Though these beings did not possess the stable form of a “mutant”, their transitional shapes that pursued a final form were clear to see.</p>, <p>And most of them… Ah, damn it. What a pain in the ass.</p>, <p><em>They’ve already set up a barricade because the guys who came earlier messed with them unnecessarily.</em></p>, <p>“Now, Curtain Call. Look at this.”</p>, <p>[Illusion Creation]</p>, <p>The internal structure of the abandoned hospital began to materialize above my hands as a three-dimensional hologram.</p>, <p>“Wow… isn’t that impressive? Kim Shin-hwa, I had no idea you were capable of this.”</p>, <p>“It’s nothing special.”</p>, <p>“Do I look like an amateur to you? You think this speed is nothing special?”</p>, <p>The ever-professional Curtain Call emphasized not the detail of the image but its rapid generation. Indeed, it wouldn’t be easy to do this at this speed without the help of special detection equipment, other items, or artifacts.</p>, <p>“Well, that’s not what’s important right now. See this barricade here?”</p>, <p>“Yes.”</p>, <p>“It’s rigged with explosives.”</p>, <p>Curtain Call whistled with an expression of interest.</p>, <p>“Interesting lunatics. Self-destruction?”</p>, <p>“No, not to that extent. More like it would hurt if tampered with.”</p>, <p>Not enough to blow the entire building down.</p>, <p>“This complicates things. Anything else?”</p>, <p>“They all have metallic machines and gunpowder… So, firearms. I’m not sure of the types, but at least some machine guns, perhaps?”</p>, <p>“There was nothing about that in the information Tudor gave us. Ah, maybe they took it from the Wild Guns?”</p>, <p>“Probably.”</p>, <p>[Cthulhu World] operated with a delicate real-time system that was quite sophisticated. The promotional materials were quite convincing as well.</p>, <p><em>It’s a dynamic real-time active quest system where every NPC moves and reacts based on your choices! Even if you visit the same place, the situation and outcomes can be completely different depending on when you go and what choices you make!</em></p>, <p>The game changed based on when I made certain choices, whom I received quests from, or sometimes the situations changed slightly at random.</p>, <p>It was an exciting system, wasn’t it? And playing the game was… haah… enjoyable. It was a fun game… Who would have thought I’d end up trapped in a game like this?</p>, <p>Now, it has turned into a reality that torments me.</p>, <p>Looking at what those guys were up to, they were clearly in a [Barricaded Stance].</p>, <p>Meaning that the creatures inside the hospital had managed to overpower the mercenaries who came for them and armed themselves with the firearms they looted from them.</p>, <p>If anyone tried to breach the barricade, someone from the second floor would likely jump out and open fire… and they had at least 1 to 4 grenades at their disposal.</p>, <p>“And up here.”</p>, <p>I continued explaining the layout while adjusting the size and orientation of the three-dimensional hologram.</p>, <p>“The ones in the windows on the third floor seem to be snipers.”</p>, <p>“I’m not too worried about the snipers, but I’m concerned about the extent of the explosives in the barricade. Kim Shin-hwa, can you take care of this?”</p>, <p>It was amazing how she wasn’t bothered by the snipers. From what I recall, Curtain Call’s stats and capabilities placed her among the elite of Vasilisa’s fixers, yet not to the extent of dismissing bullets outright.</p>, <p>I was curious whether that attitude stemmed from mere confidence or a “change” that had occurred within Curtain Call.</p>, <p>“So, you’re saying everything will be fine if just the barricade is taken care of?”</p>, <p>“Yes. Is that possible?”</p>, <p>I paused to survey the hospital building, the barricade, and the surrounding terrain.</p>, <p><em>The simplest and most brute-force solution would be to set everything ablaze and make a run for it…</em></p>, <p>Helistic would really appreciate that. They might even place a bounty on me for such a favor…</p>, <p>Moreover, while setting everything on fire might seem viable considering our main objective was subduing the test subjects, we had a secondary objective. Whether we use magic or not, we must not tamper with the systems and computers set up inside the hospital.</p>, <p>There were three cars available… and it seemed unlikely that the building would collapse even if the barricade’s explosives were detonated…</p>, <p>A few ideas came to mind.</p>, <p>“I’ll take care of it for now.”</p>, <p>“Good. If you can handle that, we’ll move on as planned. And for these, don’t want me to take care of them?”</p>, <p>Curtain Call pointed to the snipers in the hologram I had created but I could take care of them too.</p>, <p>“I’ll deal with them. Just round up those who rely on brute force on the first floor for me.”</p>, <p>“Alright, shall we get started then?”</p>, <p>“Hold on a moment.”</p>, <p>[Courage of the Lion]</p>, <p>[Willpower of the Bear]</p>, <p>[Agility of the Fox]</p>, <p>I cast several enchantment spells on Curtain Call. These spells were meant to enhance her strength, health, and agility stats.</p>, <p>Feeling the magic infuse her body, Curtain Call made an unexpectedly disgusted face.</p>, <p>“Ugh, what is this?”</p>, <p>“It’s good for you.”</p>, <p>“I could do without this…ugh…no, thank you, Kim Shin-hwa.”</p>, <p>Then she started scratching near her neck as if she was feeling itchy.</p>, <p>“You shouldn’t feel much of anything, though?”</p>, <p>“It’s itchy.”</p>, <p>“Really?”</p>, <p>“Mhmm.”</p>, <p>That can’t be possible, right? Magic allergies weren’t a thing, so what was Curtain Call talking about? Why would an enchantment spell be itchy?</p>, <p>I wanted to ask Curtain Call more about her strange reaction, but it seemed inappropriate to continue the conversation under these circumstances.</p>, <p>“Alright, let’s go, Curtain Call. Hang back for a moment; there’s something I want to try.”</p>, <p>“Whatever it is, make it quick.”</p>, <p>Curtain Call took a step back, though she was still scratching her neck.</p>, <p><em>Well, with the bombs and barricade, it’s impossible to breach without causing some disturbance.</em></p>, <p>Perhaps a flashier approach would be better?</p>, <p>[Chain of Domination]</p>, <p><em>Shrrrr—</em></p>, <p>Three chains emerged from my wrist. They were magical chains that shone with golden light.</p>, <p>The ends of the chains danced through the air before attaching themselves to the nearby abandoned cars.</p>, <p>I could manipulate objects connected to the chains.</p>, <p>Complex manipulation was out of the question with this spell, but then again, there was never a need for complex operations in the first place.</p>, <p>I forcibly started the car engines before pushing them into overload.</p>, <p><em>Vroom, Vrrroom…. Buuuuu….</em></p>, <p>A fierce rumble of engines began to resonate from the cars and it grew louder and more intense.</p>, <p>Whether it was the noise that alerted them or something else, the inside of the hospital became chaotic.</p>, <p>Lights lit up on the third floor.</p>, <p><em>Ratatatatatatatatat!</em></p>, <p>Can’t afford to die by a stray bullet.</p>, <p>So I activated the [Protection Circle] spell and simultaneously took cover behind the cars.</p>, <p>Curtain Call also melted into the darkness with her stream of aimless curses fading away.</p>, <p>Once safety was assured, I immediately started the next phase of the plan.</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>I bestowed magical durability upon every car connected to the chains.</p>, <p><em>Though charging forward just like this would work… might as well test one thing while I’m at it.</em></p>, <p>I injected a forceful command into all three cars through the [Chains of Domination].</p>, <p><strong>Don’t move.</strong></p>, <p>[Impact]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>The sound of the impact spell detonating in rapid succession was deafening.</p>, <p><em>Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!</em></p>, <p>The target was the rear of the cars which were accelerating wildly in place.</p>, <p>Like lashing a stationary horse, tremendous blows were delivered repeatedly.</p>, <p>“What, what are you doing!? Crazy, what is this… Kim Shin-woo?”</p>, <p>Curtain Call blurted out those questions as she seemed perplexed by my actions. But I was too preoccupied to respond. I was now focusing on layering more explosions and impacts onto the cars.</p>, <p><em>Kiiing- Kiiing!!!!</em></p>, <p>An impossible sound emerged from the cars.</p>, <p>A force trying to push forward was entangled with a spell command that was trying to hold it back in place which created an abnormal repulsive force.</p>, <p>Some of the energy that couldn’t dissipate combined with magical power and transformed into sparks, heat, light, and sound vibrations.</p>, <p>It meant that all the cars started to emit a menacing red glow and began to shake threateningly.</p>, <p><em>Rumble…</em></p>, <p>The sound suggested they might explode at any moment.</p>, <p>Now was the time!</p>, <p><strong>Advance at full speed.</strong></p>, <p>The accumulated repulsive force was released all at once, unleashing immense kinetic energy!</p>, <p><em>Crash-crash-crash! Bang-bang-bang!</em></p>, <p>The cars shot forward like missiles in an instant.</p>, <p>This was not merely moving forward quickly.</p>, <p>The wheels were not even touching the ground. All three cars were literally launched into the air.</p>, <p>Could this even be possible?</p>, <p>A physicist might faint foaming at the mouth if he were to hear this, but haven’t you seen it with your eyes? Here, it is possible!</p>, <p><em>It’s not that… this is the real thing.</em></p>, <p>Booooom!</p>, <p>Kaboooom!</p>, <p>The cars, propelled with insane momentum, crashed through the barricades of the hospital and embedded themselves inside.</p>, <p>At the same time, the explosives in the barricades detonated.</p>, <p>Boooooom!</p>, <p>Smoke and flames burst forth accompanied by skin-tingling vibrations and noise.</p>, <p>Yet, despite the explosion, the momentum of the cars I had sent flying did not diminish.</p>, <p>They continued to push deep into the interior of the hospital.</p>, <p>“Kim Shin-hwa! At this rate, the cars might just penetrate the hospital and come out the other side, right?”</p>, <p>“It’s possible that could actually happen.”</p>, <p><em>Crash-bang-bang-bang!</em></p>, <p>One of the cars actually went through the hospital and bounced all the way to the other side.</p>, <p>“Wow, Kim Shin-hwa! You’re the best!”</p>, <p>Despite Curtain Call’s cheers, the destruction wrought by the cars I had launched was far from over.</p>, <p><em>Bang-crash-bang-bang-bang!</em></p>, <p>Inside the building, the sound of one of the cars still wreaking havoc could be heard.</p>, <p><em>Bang!</em></p>, <p>The car that had previously smashed through the hospital and pushed its way to the other side had evidently collided with a towering tree on the opposite end.</p>, <p>Then came the sound of the tree rustling and crashing down.</p>, <p><em>Creak, creak, creeeak…</em></p>, <p><em>Rustle, rustle…Thud!</em></p>, <p>It seemed that the tree had unfortunately fallen towards the hospital. The situation was escalating beyond expectations. I could see some of the lights visible through the windows suddenly going out.</p>, <p>What? No way…….</p>, <p>Feeling a bead of cold sweat, I hastily activated a detection spell.</p>, <p>Fortunately, it seemed not all the electricity in every room was cut off.</p>, <p>It was hard to say with certainty, but the area I was aiming for appeared to be safe.</p>, <p>Curtain Call was unaware of my inner turmoil and she remarked on the situation with evident amusement.</p>, <p>“So that’s why Tudor values you so much? You’re capable of such incredible feats?”</p>, <p>This wasn’t a result of my magic, though.</p>, <p>In the world of [Cthulhu World] such a feat was a widely shared skill among the veterans (stagnant waters) that it’s considered a basic requirement for engaging in meaningful conversations with others.</p>, <p>It originated as a sort of a bug…. but it’s been used by so many players that it’s practically become an official strategy or a widely known trick.</p>, <p>It’s not some hidden piece or anything; the game was simply poorly made.</p>, <p>The reason such antics were possible in the game was due to a glitch in the physics engine.</p>, <p><em>But why does this work here, in the real world?</em></p>, <p>How could such a bug exist in this vivid and tangible world?</p>, <p><em>Anyway, the laws of this world are far more lax than those of the world I came from.</em></p>, <p>I must take advantage of everything available to survive and escape.</p>, <p>“It’s an attack!”</p>, <p>“Move the injured!”</p>, <p>Voices buzzed inside the hospital. A few faces peeked through the gaping holes in the barricade.</p>, <p>They must have been on guard, but they couldn’t have anticipated such a bizarre bombardment.</p>, <p>[Remaining Targets: 6/58]</p>, <p>Six were subdued in one go. Were there any casualties? If they were lucky, they might have survived.</p>, <p>“Alright, it’s my turn now. I’ll meet you on the third floor in a bit.”</p>, <p>With those words, Curtain Call sprinted away at an incredible speed and headed for the hospital’s wide-open main entrance.</p>, <p><em>Ratatatatatatatatatat!</em></p>, <p>With a huge sword slung over her shoulder, her small frame burst forth at an unnatural speed. It was a display of agility that only a warrior who had transformed all the excessive magical power inside them into physical strength could achieve.</p>, <p>The ground where her feet landed could not withstand the impact and ruptured.</p>, <p>She closed the distance in the blink of an eye and, with a spirited momentum, latched onto one of the test subjects while screaming.</p>, <p>“Cover your head!!”</p>, <p>“Wha-what the!!”</p>, <p>The test subject reflexively attempted to shield his head, but her sword was descending with the force of a lightning strike and it cleaved through his defensive posture. Blood was sprayed in all directions.</p>, <p>Yet Curtain Call did not stop. She spun around before slicing through another clumsily advancing test subject.</p>, <p>“Die, all of you!!”</p>, <p>Following that, she plunged into the hospital. At the same time, chaos erupted inside. Screams, shouts, explosions, the indiscriminate noise of gunfire, the blood mist painting the windows red, and the heads of test subjects crashing through the glass. Crash!</p>, <p>Soon after, a bloody Curtain Call jumped out of another window.</p>, <p>She rolled around several times without stopping, and then with movements that seemed to be defying inertia and the laws of physics, she went back sprinting toward the back of the hospital.</p>, <p>“Capture her!”</p>, <p>“No, stop! Don’t chase her!”</p>, <p>“Kill her!”</p>, <p>The test subjects were in disarray and unable to make a decisive call.</p>, <p>As expected, the true beauty of wide-area suppression lies in destruction, chaos, and madness.</p>, <p>Now is not the time to stand still.</p>, <p>It’s time to show what a real veteran player (stagnant water) can do.</p>, <p>I focused my mind and released my magical power.</p>, <p>It was several times more than the amount I usually gathered for casting spells.</p>, <p>A dense and potent magical power began to flow out.</p>, <p>The ground around trembled, and the air stirred.</p>, <p>A huge magic circle with a diameter of 1.5 meters soon started to form in front of me.</p>, <p>In [Cthulhu World], the intelligence stat was the wellspring of magical power that simultaneously provided everything needed to activate, apply, and create magic.</p>, <p>For this reason, I had endured the excruciating penalties to secure as high an intelligence stat as possible.</p>, <p>Currently, my intelligence stat stood at 30.</p>, <p>Thanks to this, I possessed an enormous amount of magical power which surpassed the limits allowed to humans.</p>, <p><em>With such an excess of magical power, I can attempt some utterly absurd feats.</em></p>, <p>I brought my hands together and then spread them apart.</p>, <p>One magic circle split into two, and then three.</p>, <p>The trails of magical power shining in different colors were being combined at slightly different speeds.</p>, <p>In the end, five magic circles were formed.</p>, <p>These magic circles set to activate a different type of spell will be completed one by one at regular intervals.</p>, <p><em>And the first one would be launched immediately.</em></p>, <p>The first magic circle to be completed was a blazing red fire spell.</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Whoooosh—</em></p>, <p>A fireball as large as the magic circle itself emerged and soared toward the hospital entrance.</p>, <p>Upon impact, the already devastated entrance where the car had crashed was engulfed in ferocious flames.</p>, <p><em>Boooooooom!</em></p>]\n",

            "[<p>“Arghhh! It’s a mage!”</p>, <p>Following the destructive charge of three cars, a fierce warrior burst in, followed by a surge of fire magic. Amidst this, shrill cries of alarm pierced the air.</p>, <p>“My headddddd!”</p>, <p>“Arghhh!”</p>, <p>“Capture them!”</p>, <p>“Avoid it!”</p>, <p>“Run away!”</p>, <p>“Fight!”</p>, <p>The chaos among the test subjects had reached a point of no return.</p>, <p>“Fire!

I have no intention of setting the hospital on fire anyway.</p>, <p>In 90 seconds, a huge wave would hit the building.</p>, <p>The next magic circle to be completed was a water spell that churned with a brilliant blue color.</p>, <p>Well now, I must attend to my own matters.</p>, <p>The magic circles were set to complete the magic on their own and activate the spells in sequence.</p>, <p>I had informed Curtain Call of the intervals at which the spells would be activated so she would have to dodge them on her own.</p>, <p>“Die, die, die, die!! You Helistic bastards, die all of you!!!!”</p>, <p>It was a scream filled with madness. That must be Curtain Call… but would she really remember the timing of the spells activation in her current state?</p>, <p><em>Ah, forget it. She will handle it, I suppose.</em></p>, <p>The hospital and the test subjects were ablaze, quite literally. When I expanded my detection spell and checked, I found that the majority of the test subjects went down to the first floor. They would be chasing both Curtain Call who boldly darted in and out of the building and the virtual mage conjured by one of my magic circles.</p>, <p>I left the magic circles alone and threw the skateboard on the ground.</p>, <p>[Dazzling Dance Moves]</p>, <p>[Agility of the Fox]</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>[Hazy Presence]</p>, <p>A dazzling pattern of lights emerged over my black hoodie.</p>, <p>When I stepped onto the board, it began to race forward with incredible speed, even though I hadn’t pushed off with my foot at all.</p>, <p><em>Brbrbrbrbrbrbr!!!</em></p>, <p>The wheels of the board created a terrible noise since I was riding on the unpaved dirt road. A cloud of dust rose behind me, but no one was paying attention to me thanks to the tremendous commotion and the darkness.</p>, <p>Navigating the hospital felt like clearing levels in an RPG game, requiring one to endure various hardships and obstacles in a predetermined order.</p>, <p>Why bother dealing with the hospital’s minions one by one and physically overcoming the traps laid out as if seeking some great fortune or glory?</p>, <p>The strategy was simple: while a tank drew the aggro on the first floor, I would ascend to the third floor and swiftly deal with the boss. And that’s it</p>, <p>But before making a direct attack, there was a place I needed to visit.</p>, <p>I steered the board towards a dark corner inside the hospital parking lot.</p>, <p><em>Yes, that’s it.</em></p>, <p>There, right there, was something I needed.</p>, <p>A round and wide object made of metal…</p>, <p>It was a pot lid.</p>, <p>No, it was far more efficient than a pot lid.</p>, <p>[Round Shield (E-rank armor): A round shield made of metal, equipped with a strap on the inside for attachment to one arm.]</p>, <p>It was a piece of junk equipment, devoid of any magical enhancements.</p>, <p>According to the setting, someone from the Wild Guns team that had entered here before had brought it along. It was just a disposable item, always left lying around for anyone to use as they saw fit.</p>, <p>[Magnetic Control]</p>, <p><em>Buzzzzzzz!!</em></p>, <p>I activated the second-order magnetic control spell with my left hand and started pulling the metal shield toward me. And soon enough, the shield quickly attached itself to my left hand.</p>, <p><em>Ugh, it’s a bit heavy for someone with a strength of 8.</em></p>, <p>I then accelerated towards the hospital building again. Moving with the shield like this made me feel somewhat like a superhero.</p>, <p>Anyway, at the moment when the skateboard’s explosive acceleration reached its peak…</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>I used magic to jump. However, I couldn’t reach the third floor with a single leap using the Leap spell. But that wasn’t a major issue.</p>, <p>“Alright, for this part…. I’ll just overcome it with a bit of agility!”</p>, <p>This part was crucial. It wasn’t my first time attempting such a feat, but executing these maneuvers perfectly with only an agility stat of 8 was a challenge.</p>, <p>However, a few enchantment spells I had activated in advance helped in controlling my posture in mid-air and allowed me to move in the intended manner, albeit with some difficulty.</p>, <p>I twisted my body and adjusted the skateboard to the right angle in the air. At the same time, I cast a new spell on the board.</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>[Blast]</p>, <p>I activated an explosion spell beneath the board whose durability has been increased through magic…. And propelled myself even further into the air!</p>, <p>I was catapulted through the air while holding on to the board.</p>, <p>The world spun dizzyingly. The hospital’s outer wall, a window, and the face of a sniper fumbling with his rifle rushed towards me at breakneck speed.</p>, <p>“Hello?”</p>, <p>“Aaaah!”</p>, <p>The sniper was so surprised that he took a shooting position a step too late.</p>, <p><em>Ratat!!</em></p>, <p>He fired his gun but I was already extending the shield in front of me. Of course, I couldn’t rely solely on this flimsy shield, so I added a layer of magic for protection.</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p><em>Ding, ding, ding!!!</em></p>, <p>Good. I rushed into him with my defensive posture intact and flattened him beneath me.</p>, <p><em>Crash!</em></p>, <p>“Ugh!”</p>, <p>Everything went exactly as planned! I subdued him right then and there.</p>, <p>I released a burst of electricity from the hand holding the shield.</p>, <p>[Lightning]</p>, <p><em>Fzzzzzzt!</em></p>, <p>“Guuuuh….”</p>, <p>The metal shield conducted the electricity exceptionally well.</p>, <p>See? If you’re a veteran (stagnant water), you have to do at least this much.</p>, <p>“Don’t move!”</p>, <p>There were two windows on the third floor, and correspondingly, two snipers.</p>, <p>The sniper standing at the other window was yelling at me.</p>, <p>He was a test subject with an unnatural third arm attached to his back.</p>, <p>“Hey, wait a moment!”</p>, <p>He ignored my words and lifted his rifle.</p>, <p>Hmm, no use talking then. Well, the timing is perfect</p>, <p><em>Now…!</em></p>, <p><em>Kwoooosh!!!</em></p>, <p>The second magic circle I had prepared activated the second spell.</p>, <p>It was such a huge wave that it was hard to believe that it came from a place without water.</p>, <p>The violent waves surged as if they were about to engulf the hospital, causing a tremendous shock.</p>, <p>The entire building started shaking.</p>, <p>Caught off guard by the sudden impact, the second sniper faltered. In that moment, I gained time to respond to his shooting.</p>, <p><em>Ratatat!</em></p>, <p>I wanted to block like a superhero with my shield but my agility was just too poor.</p>, <p>[Distortion Field]</p>, <p><em>Bababang!</em></p>, <p>The sniper was taken aback as he saw the bullets being deflected by an invisible barrier before flying off in random directions.</p>, <p>“Hey, do you like superhero movies?”</p>, <p>“Huh? Uh…??”</p>, <p>While he was bewildered and uttering confused sounds…</p>, <p>[Magnetic Control]</p>, <p>I imbued the shield in my hand with a strong magnetic force and hurled it at him.</p>, <p><em>Swoooosh!</em></p>, <p>The flying shield collided with the rifle he was holding.</p>, <p><em>Crash!</em></p>, <p>“Argh!!”</p>, <p>The second sniper, struck by the shield, fell backward with the shield still attached to him.</p>, <p>“Is this about done here?”</p>, <p>I muttered to myself and shifted my gaze elsewhere before casting a spell on the fallen sniper.</p>, <p>[Thunderbolt]</p>, <p><em>Fizzzzzzzzzzzz!!</em></p>, <p>“Rrrrrrgh!!”</p>, <p>Due to the Ring of Corrupted Flame, I often felt an impulse to invoke fire-type spells even in unnecessary situations. However, for subduing individuals, the stun effect of lightning-type magic proved to be more efficient.</p>, <p>[System: The ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ trait has been activated.]</p>, <p>I thought it was a sufficiently dangerous situation so far, but suddenly the vigilance trait kicked in.</p>, <p>My senses were forcibly sharpened, allowing me to perceive the flow of magical power, the presence of killing intent, and other dangers around me in my mind.</p>, <p>There was nothing inside the room that could pose a threat to me. The problem was, what about outside the window?</p>, <p>I felt a chill down my spine. And a sinister killing intent.</p>, <p>I thought of casting a spell… No, I shouldn’t use magic. I need to dodge!</p>, <p>I quickly turned my head and activated the “Short-Range Shift” trait to move my body.</p>, <p>[System: Due to insufficient agility stat, the efficiency of ‘Short-Range Shift’ has been reduced.]</p>, <p>I ignored the system nonsense and forced my body to move!</p>, <p>I was able to move my body quickly with the feeling that the joints of my waist, legs, and knees were creaking.</p>, <p><em>Thwack!</em></p>, <p>It was only afterward that I could see what the danger was. A throwing knife. The sharply thrown knife had whizzed past where I had been a second ago and embedded itself in the wall.</p>, <p>And in the direction from which the knife had come… there, hanging outside the window, was a test subject with hands eerily evolved like those of a lizard.</p>, <p><em>And here I was wondering why I thought I couldn’t stop it with magic.</em></p>, <p>The enemy was a former fixer turned test subject, bearing a fixer name, and the mid-boss of this abandoned hospital quest. His fixer name was… well…</p>, <p>“Ah, Mr. Leopard. A pleasure to see you.”</p>, <p>“You fu*king fixer. Have you crawled all the way here just to oppress us further?”</p>, <p>His lizard-like face was distorted grotesquely.</p>, <p>“Well, I bear no particular grudge against you folks… but you were a fixer once, weren’t you?”</p>, <p>“That’s right. I chased money, burning through my luck and life, until I ended up here. But it seems your luck has run out.”</p>, <p>“Well, you see. I brought another person to hold someone like you.”</p>, <p>Leopard’s mouth was grotesquely split wide open on either side of his face. He flashed a horrifying grin with his grotesque mouth that stretched far beyond the limits allowed to a human and stuck out his forked tongue to lick his own forehead. A true monster.</p>, <p>“Correct. A mage cannot stand against me.”</p>, <p>Among the fixers who wielded bizarre abilities through their innate magic, this lizardman was a peculiar case. He employed primitive forms of natural magic, much like Lee Chang-hyuk…</p>, <p><em>Swoosh!!</em></p>, <p>Multiple knives flew in again from outside the window.</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>I instinctively activated the protective circle, but the knives continued their flight and penetrated the barrier as if it wasn’t there.</p>, <p>Those knives!</p>, <p>Leopard’s unique ability was to nullify magic within a localized area. The knives, propelled by his telekinesis, could pierce through protective shields and distortion fields.</p>, <p>I couldn’t block them. I had to evade! Ah, damn it, there’s no time. This is too harsh for a mage.</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>I didn’t want to resort to such things again, but I threw myself away with the invisible hands.</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>And then, I belatedly activated a leap….and narrowly avoided a disastrous tumble to the ground.</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>, <p>“You move well for a mage!”</p>, <p>With those words, Leopard ducked under the window to avoid the fireball. Tch… lucky for you, it would be nice to get a modification to make my body faster.</p>, <p>Leopard soon revealed himself from another window and hurled a knife.</p>, <p>“Seriously, moving in patterns? This isn’t some ’90s shooter game!”</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>I propelled myself forward again….and then raised my magical power. Just because the enemy relied on predictable patterns didn’t mean I had to follow suit. This time, I opted for a completely different tactic.</p>, <p>[Magnetic Control]</p>, <p>[Spell Amplification: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Zzzzzzzz!!</em></p>, <p>A shield endowed with excessively amplified magnetism floated in the air. The shield hovering like a drone spun violently and intercepted the trajectory of the incoming knife.</p>, <p><em>Ting!</em></p>, <p>“Wh-what is that!?”</p>, <p>This shield wasn’t brought along for nothing!</p>, <p>[Chains of Domination]</p>, <p><em>Shshshshsh!!</em></p>, <p>Golden chains wrapped around the shield. And the shield that was imbued with magnetic power and telekinetic power through the chains …. was launched like a projectile.</p>, <p><em>Thwack!!</em></p>, <p>“Ugh!”</p>, <p>Sadly, he moved a half-beat faster than I did. With near-death desperation, he dodged and the spinning shield I had hurled merely grazed some part of his face or head.</p>, <p>Leopard who had momentarily concealed himself beneath the window….</p>, <p>“Haha! What a shame!”</p>, <p>Revealed himself with a clichéd taunt. And now, as if he was definitely planning to finish this off, he prepared to swing his arm with several knives wedged between his fingers.</p>, <p>“Ah, watch your back!”</p>, <p>“?!”</p>, <p>The shield I had sent flying was returning at a tremendous speed.</p>, <p><em>Crash!!</em></p>, <p>Hmm, in the game, I always took down Leopard this way; it seems to work here too.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“Aaaaargh… this damned…”</p>, <p>He didn’t go down with just one blow. Does he have scales on the back of his head? But he lost his balance completely when he took an unexpected hit from a blind spot and was now crouching by the window with his head thrust forward.</p>, <p>“Watch out, Leo!”</p>, <p>“Grr!”</p>, <p>He tried to adopt an attitude as if to say “I won’t be fooled!” But this time, I was a half-step ahead.</p>, <p>“Watch out for the window!”</p>, <p>[Lock]</p>, <p>This spell really has an incredibly powerful effect.</p>, <p>When activated, it can close any nearby doors or windows.</p>, <p>Impressive, right? It was just a zero-order spell.</p>, <p><em>Bang!</em></p>, <p>But when an excessive amount of magical power was infused into such a spell, it could unleash tremendous speed and force.</p>, <p>As the window slammed shut with vigorous force, it struck Leopard on the head.</p>, <p>Had his fingers been carelessly placed, they would have likely been severed.</p>, <p>Struck on the head by the window frame, Leopard couldn’t even scream before he passed out and fell down below the window.</p>, <p>“What is this!”</p>, <p><em>Crackling!</em></p>, <p>The sound of Curtain Call’s shout came from below. Hmm, it seems the battle is still raging on.</p>, <p>When I approached the window and looked down, I saw that Leopard’s body was cut in half.</p>, <p>There was no sign of Curtain Call, though. Expanding my detection range, I found her beyond the fence. Why was she there? Ah, I see.</p>, <p>The time had come.</p>, <p>Outside the hospital, a bright blue flash illuminated the surroundings.</p>, <p><em>Boom!!!</em></p>, <p>Since the third magic circle was completed, the prepared [Lightning Strike] must have been activated.</p>, <p>The test subjects who were clumsily attempting to pursue Curtain Call and ventured outside were caught in the lightning and burned to a crisp.</p>, <p>“So many have died.”</p>, <p>Though they were all once human, each and every one of them was a despicable murderer.</p>, <p>Leopard too had become an irredeemable pleasure killer due to his inherent cruel nature and the madness he gained from repeatedly working as a fixer.</p>, <p>He had fallen for Helistic’s sweet talk of physical enhancement and a chance for a new identity before ultimately surrendering himself to their deranged modification experiments.</p>, <p>Having dealt with the mid-boss, perhaps now there was only one to be wary of?</p>, <p><em>That lunatic is more dangerous than all the others here combined.</em></p>, <p>Defeating the mid-boss meant that the main boss was still out there.</p>, <p>His name was Je Mu-gyeong.</p>, <p>With the exception of him, the rest were just fools with unique appearances that were incapable of doing any real harm.</p>, <p><em>Surely he hasn’t moved to another location amidst this chaos?</em></p>, <p>I could feel an ominous and unsettling magical power on the third floor where I stood. He was still here on the third floor.</p>, <p><em>Let’s see…</em></p>, <p>This was as good a time as any to get things in order.</p>, <p>I put the invisibility spell on myself again and leaned out the window.</p>, <p>Just then, five test subjects were emerging from the hospital.</p>, <p>The way they each held their weapons and moved in line was quite coordinated.</p>, <p>The snipers on the third floor had been a mess, but these ones seemed to be of a different caliber.</p>, <p>“Where are they off to?”</p>, <p>The test subjects moved in a direction I didn’t expect. I thought they would be moving in the direction of Curtain Call and got ready to provide cover…</p>, <p>But instead, they were moving toward the area where I had set up my magic circles.</p>, <p>“Aha.”</p>, <p>So they were trying to capture the mage while Curtain Call was out of sight. A sound strategy, indeed, if there was actually a mage there.</p>, <p>Regrettably for them, there was no one at the location they were approaching.</p>, <p>Only the two magic circles I had left behind remained.</p>, <p>Whether they approached or not was of no concern to me…</p>, <p>In fact, it was the perfect opportunity.</p>, <p>I reached out through the window and started remotely manipulating the distant magic circles.</p>, <p><em>They’re a bit far for complex operations, but I can still channel some magical power into them.</em></p>, <p>What usually happens when a spell fails?</p>, <p>The spell could backfire, injure the mage, or produce a result completely different from what was intended.</p>, <p><em>Or… The uncontrolled spell might overload and cause a huge explosion.</em></p>, <p>While it’s difficult to precisely imbue new properties on the magic circles, overloading them with magical power is feasible.</p>, <p>It was a shame to waste two magic circles right here but their pattern had already been deciphered by the enemy.</p>, <p>Better to make a significant impact than to waste them meaninglessly.</p>, <p>I forcibly distorted the shape of the magic circles.</p>, <p>Two magic circles with opposing properties interfered with each other….and that created a deadly repulsive force.</p>, <p><em>Fizzz, crackle, fizzz!</em></p>, <p><em>Now, explode…</em></p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>A blinding flash of light and a tremendous explosion ensued, causing the windows to shudder. Ugh, did I overdo it with the explosion?</p>, <p>The test subjects who had bravely pushed forward all collapsed onto the floor in a near-death state.</p>, <p><em>Oh, they’re quite the sturdy bunch.</em></p>, <p>Still, they were tough enough to physically force their way toward where they thought the mage might be.</p>, <p>It seemed their bodies had been robustly modified as they weren’t dead even after the explosion.</p>, <p>They were twitching slightly… With some luck, they might survive.</p>, <p>The regularly triggered spells were now over. Therefore, I began forming a new spell for Curtain Call.</p>, <p>[R’lyeh’s Fog]</p>, <p><em>Gurglegurgle…</em></p>, <p>A white fog started to rise from all around. A magically dense fog with surreal density enveloped the entire hospital. The test subjects on the first floor would now be unable to see what was approaching through the fog or know where to direct their attacks.</p>, <p>And such uncertainty would breed fear.</p>, <p>[The unique effect of the L-rank accessory ‘Carcosa’s Mask’, ‘Yellow Dominion’, has been activated.</p>, <p>// Yellow Dominion: Adds the effect ‘Spell Amplification: Instill Fear’ to certain spells.]</p>, <p>“Wh-What is that?!”</p>, <p>“What? What’s going on?!”</p>, <p>“In the fog! That monster! There’s a monster!”</p>, <p>“Aaaaah!”</p>, <p>This should be enough. After all, my role was merely to buy time for Curtain Call. Having provided so much help, she should take care of the rest herself.</p>, <p>The only task remaining was to deal with Je Mu-gyeong, who was holed up in another room. Once that was accomplished, the most difficult part would be over.</p>, <p>“Huuu…”</p>, <p>I held the mask with both hands for a moment and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong was a fairly strong enemy, but I had faced him several times in the game before.</p>, <p>I roughly knew his weaknesses and understood that communication was possible under certain circumstances.</p>, <p>Therefore, there was no issue.</p>, <p>The real problem was that my body was getting tired really quickly due to the array of penalty traits clinging to me.</p>, <p>Moreover, although my level had somewhat increased, the [Decreased Stamina] trait meant my HP was critically low.</p>, <p>Should I allow even a single clean hit, magic or not, I would suffer irreparable damage.</p>, <p><em>Well… shall I start moving now?</em></p>, <p>There were a total of six rooms on the third floor of the hospital.</p>, <p>However, there was no need to check each room one by one.</p>, <p>There were only so many rooms I needed to visit.</p>, <p>First of all, here and now.</p>, <p>A wide room with a sniper present.</p>, <p>Anyway, since I suppressed the sniper here, there was no longer any reason to linger in this room.</p>, <p>Apart from the sniper, it was just a spacious room with nothing much to see.</p>, <p><em>Ah, of course, if one were to follow the game’s intended path, there would be essential tasks to complete.</em></p>, <p>In the corner, there was a cabinet filled with documents revealing the hospital’s backstory.</p>, <p>Reading through them would unveil secrets like…. “Ah! So there’s something hidden in this hospital? There’s a strange secret space beneath it? And to access that place, the USB held by the director of the lab is absolutely necessary?” This information would come to light.</p>, <p>Then by interrogating the snipers, it would be discovered that the USB had long since fallen into the hands of the leader of the test subjects, Je Mu-gyeong.</p>, <p>That was the progression of the story.</p>, <p>Since I wasn’t here to enjoy the game’s narrative, there was no need for me to engage in such investigative activities. In other words, once entry and suppression were completed, there was no further business in this room.</p>, <p>“I came in praying that only the snipers would come out, but getting aggro from Leopard ended up draining me unnecessarily…”</p>, <p>I twisted my already frail body around the air and even threw it… bringing Curtain Call seemed hardly worth it.</p>, <p>I massaged the back of my neck as I slowly walked toward the door.</p>, <p>The moment I reached for the doorknob, I let out a sigh.</p>, <p>“Ah, damn. Now that I think about it, this pattern means the hallway out here must be a total mess by now…”</p>, <p>I slowly turned the doorknob, and the door creaked open with an annoying squeak.</p>, <p>As the door opened, the first sensation that hit me was the smell.</p>, <p>The repulsive odor of blood. I had encountered the scent of blood numerous times while roaming through [Cthulhu World] in Paju.</p>, <p>I had been through the zombie-infested [K-3675 Secret Research Facility] and visited the underground parking lot that had become a ghoul’s den, where bodies were piled up like mountains. However, the stench wafting through here was more intense and unpleasant than anything I had previously encountered.</p>, <p>Visually, too, the sight was horrific. The third floor’s hallway was a scene of utter devastation.</p>, <p>The walls were cracked here and there, and pieces of human bodies were scattered all around.</p>, <p>The floor bore clear signs of blood that had flowed like rivers.</p>, <p>It was the aftermath of the armed uprising by the test subjects who had massacred the Helistic researchers present in the hospital.</p>, <p><em>Lunatics, all of them…</em></p>, <p>Given that these were researchers involved in human experimentation, they couldn’t exactly be called innocent victims.</p>, <p>Even so, the horrific scene created by the test subjects was truly abnormal.</p>, <p>A vicious slaughter and a party of ruthless madness had unfolded here.</p>, <p>Bodies mutilated in a manner that mocked dignity.</p>, <p>Corpses bearing an excessive number of wounds.</p>, <p>Entrails decorating the walls.</p>, <p>Heads displayed on tables.</p>, <p>There were even traces of a grotesque game resembling bowling with body parts.</p>, <p>The bodies had been toyed with as if they were mere playthings.</p>, <p>While not enough to trigger my [Madness of the Abss] trait, the sight was nauseating. What a bunch of lunatics.</p>, <p><em>No. Wait a moment.</em></p>, <p>Was this really not enough to trigger my trait?</p>, <p>No, the atrocity in this place was indeed horrific.</p>, <p>But it wasn’t shocking. My mind did not crumble from psychological shock, nor did my limbs shrivel from overwhelming fear.</p>, <p>Could it be that encountering mythical beings had numbed my emotions?</p>, <p>The notion of losing human emotions felt somewhat disturbing.</p>, <p>No, let’s not dwell on that now. After all, my current state might be more useful for survival.</p>, <p><em>Don’t think too much, Kim Shin-hwa. Just focus on surviving and returning to your original world.</em></p>, <p>Aside from that, I felt disgusted. Perhaps this sensation stemmed from memories and habits of my former self, but regardless, I felt revolted.</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong, that lunatic leader of the rebel test subjects. I felt like beating him up might improve my mood.</p>, <p>“Huuu…”</p>, <p>Though it wasn’t the best place for a deep breath, I paused and focused on stabilizing my breathing to calm my mind.</p>, <p>It wasn’t a moment for leisure, but rushing wouldn’t help either.</p>, <p>Before encountering Je Mu-gyeong, there was somewhere else I needed to stop by.</p>, <p>Among the four doors lined up along the corridor, it was the second one from the left.</p>, <p>A sign hung on the door reading:</p>, <p>[Pharmaceutical Warehouse]</p>, <p>That’s the place. There’s something I need to pick up there.</p>, <p><em>Ugh, it’s good to be prepared… but of course, a fuck*ng horror show was waiting in this room too.</em></p>, <p>The blood, entrails, and gruesomely dismembered bodies displayed in this wretched hallway were just the beginning.</p>, <p>[Cthulhu World] is a game filled with cosmic horror and madness.</p>, <p>This hospital was designed with that theme in mind.</p>, <p>And each room within it awaited with its own unsettling horrors.</p>, <p>And witnessing these horrors was enough to drive one to madness… It was quite the exciting place, in many ways.</p>, <p><em>But who would have thought I’d be experiencing these delightful elements firsthand.</em></p>, <p>It’s supposed to be fun because it’s a game, but in reality, it’s not fun at all.</p>, <p>It just makes me angry.</p>, <p>But then again, doing nothing changes nothing…</p>, <p><em>Ah… I’ve been here often, but it’s always hopeless.</em></p>, <p>I slowly opened the door.</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>Creaaak…</em></p>, <p>Just like it was written on the door, this room was a pharmaceutical warehouse.</p>, <p>Inside the dim room, you can see glass display cases built in layers.</p>, <p>[The room is dark and somewhat cold.</p>, <p>This is probably to preserve the medicines stored inside.]</p>, <p>Oh, what a surprise. After being quiet for a while, it suddenly started working.</p>, <p>Why didn’t it make any sound in the corridor earlier? There’s supposed to be designated text for the corridor as well.</p>, <p>Is it just slacking off? Or maybe… Ah, could it be because I didn’t enter in the set order?</p>, <p>Normally, one should first enter the corridor while coming up the stairs.</p>, <p>But this time, I entered through a window, so perhaps the message that should have appeared in the corridor didn’t trigger?</p>, <p>Given the game’s history of bugs and errors, I can’t be certain, but it feels like that might be the case.</p>, <p><em>Well, if not, no harm done.</em></p>, <p>[In the room, each glass display case is filled with bottles labeled with medicines and small specimens.</p>, <p>Each transparent bottle you see contains animal or human body parts, or strange creatures you have never seen before.]</p>, <p>“Hey, I can see things with my own eyes too.”</p>, <p>[The creature within is truly bizarre and horrifying. It is a grotesque monster, neither human nor beast, with four arms and each small hand has six fingers. Upon witnessing this entity, your mind is engulfed in an alien fear and terror.]</p>, <p>Oh dear, it’s exciting. Really exciting</p>, <p>[System: Attempting to resist the distortion with your mental strength stat. Mental strength check succeeded</p>, <p>Since I resisted the fear, no additional traits were triggered.</p>, <p>I raised my hand briefly to cover the mask’s eye sockets, then lowered it.</p>, <p>“Alright. Let’s put off the unpleasant feelings for later.”</p>, <p>There’s something here I want to take with me.</p>, <p>The things in the bottles all look similarly repulsive, but one stands out as particularly vile. It’s the strange creature mentioned in the message window earlier. The label on the bottle reads “Type D Biological Tissue Sample”, along with two words: “Dimensional Species”.</p>, <p>When I reached for the bottle, I could feel the tiny creature wriggling inside, even though it was soaked in chemicals and sealed in a glass bottle.</p>, <p>It was not a mistake. Part of the small creature’s grotesquely swollen head split open. And from the fissure, small round eyes emerged and they were looking at me. Although the eyes lacked emotion, I could sense an unpleasant and ominous intelligence in their gaze.</p>, <p>However, this bizarre scene did not last long. The creature soon closed its eyes again, as if it had lost interest. It looked to be peaceful as if dead or asleep.</p>, <p>“Tsk, this is why I didn’t like this place.”</p>, <p>The unnecessary horror elements kept repeating endlessly.</p>, <p>I packed two of such bottles, took several protective measures, and then carefully placed them in my backpack.</p>, <p>With that taken care of, before heading out…</p>, <p>“Maybe I should do some quick looting?”</p>, <p>Among the medicines here, there were some useful ones.</p>, <p>It would be best not to put myself in situations where these would be needed, but the upcoming encounter with Je Mu-gyeong would be troublesome. He wears a special artifact with high magic resistance, and stripping it would be more efficiently done with the medicines here than with magic.</p>, <p>“Let’s see… is this the one?”</p>, <p>Among the bottles, I picked up a blue one without a label.</p>, <p>[Valusia’s Blue Elixir (S-rank Catalyst): One of the potions used by the ancient serpent people. It contains a corrosively potent poison that can be deadly, so it’s dangerous to use without proper purification.]</p>, <p>Besides that, wouldn’t it be a good idea to bring a few more things with me?</p>, <p><em>Ah, this one releases toxic gas when it gets exposed to the air.</em></p>, <p>Naturally, it would be problematic if such items were to go off while in my possession.</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>I applied a hardening spell to the bottle. When needed, I could effectively use it like an improvised grenade by removing the hardening spell and throwing it.</p>, <p>I packed several into my backpack and kept a few within easy reach, then made my way back to the corridor.</p>, <p><em>I feel like a complete fool. Can’t I just set fire from outside?</em></p>, <p>Of course, that wasn’t an option.</p>, <p>The quest was far from over.</p>, <p>There were a few more miserable sights to endure.</p>, <p>Alright, it was time to confront Je Mu-gyeong, who was holed up in the surgery room…</p>, <p>I headed towards the surgery room located at the farthest end of the corridor.</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong was so engrossed in “surgery” that he rarely came out unless it was necessary.</p>, <p>The entrance to the surgery room, like everything else in the corridor, was soaked in blood and gave off a grim atmosphere.</p>, <p>Above the door, an electronic sign flashed “In Surgery” which only added to the eerie setting.</p>, <p>Even before Je Mu-gyeong and his test subjects had taken over, this place was far from where any standard surgeries were performed.</p>, <p>It was a site of grotesque procedures: extracting brains, dismembering humans, or reassembling the dismembered parts into some macabre form.</p>, <p><em>There is a whole bunch of shit going on in there that no one in their right mind will find normal.</em></p>, <p>I could simply launch a barrage of fireballs from outside the door and spare myself the sight of any more horrors…</p>, <p>Yet even though the minions on the first floor were expendable, Je Mu-gyeong was a different matter.</p>, <p>I needed the USB he possessed to access the secret underground facility I had discussed with Curtain Call.</p>, <p>Even during my time playing the game, rushing in with flashy explosions or lighting attacks led to many failed quests.</p>, <p>And there was something else, perhaps even more important than the quest itself, something that might hold value far beyond the promised reward of 120 million.</p>, <p>I wanted to talk to him.</p>, <p>Although the chances were slim, there was a possibility that Je Mu-gyeong held the clue to my return to my original world.</p>, <p><em>Well, realistically speaking, the likelihood of that is probably less than 5%…</em></p>, <p>No, it might even be less than 1%.</p>, <p>Yet, the chance was not zero. Among all the NPCs I had encountered so far, he alone held a possibility that none had. Oh, of course, except for those damned beings of the abyss.</p>, <p>Given such a circumstance, it would be foolish to simply eliminate him without attempting dialogue, right?</p>, <p>With that slim chance in mind, I had devised a plan to confront Je Mu-gyeong alone, ready to face the risks for the sake of a potentially pivotal conversation.</p>, <p>“So, let’s try having a chat.”</p>, <p>I used my magical power to push the door open to avoid touching the dirty door handle.</p>, <p><em>Creeeak…</em></p>, <p>The stench of rotting corpses mixed with chemical odors and the smell of blood wafted from the inside of the surgery room.</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong was a lunatic.</p>, <p>It’s ironic for someone like me who goes around wearing a mask to say this, but he was a lunatic obsessed with irrational behavior.</p>, <p><em>Squelch… squelch-squelch…</em></p>, <p>It was the unsettling sound of tearing flesh.</p>, <p>It was originally a horrific surgery room where crazy surgeries were routinely performed, but now it has transformed into a workshop for a lunatic.</p>, <p>Blood splattered up to the ceiling.</p>, <p>Bodies with their skin flayed lay in pieces.</p>, <p>And then there were the saws, hammers, large butcher knives, hooks, and chains.</p>, <p>The tools seemed more fitting for a slaughterhouse or butcher’s shop than a surgery room.</p>, <p>In fact, activities not much different from those were taking place here.</p>, <p>To be more specific, a monstrous figure with a huge frame was hunched over next to the surgery table while carrying out the ghastly task of ripping the skin off corpses.</p>, <p>His body was so majestic that you could feel the pressure even though he was hunched over.</p>, <p>His shoulders were so broad that it seemed as if one could seat a person on each and still have room to spare.</p>, <p>The creature was a monster created by [Ga-5060 Secret Research Facility].</p>, <p>The most remarkable failure among dozens of failed experiments.</p>, <p>It was Je Mu-gyeong.</p>, <p>“Hello?”</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong who had been deeply engrossed in his work beside the surgery table lifted his head to look at me.</p>, <p>He was draped in a hideous sackcloth that covered his body, head, and face.</p>, <p>The sackcloth that looked like what a medieval monk might wear, was more akin to a cape or raincoat than actual clothing.</p>, <p>“Your skills in making clothes are quite dreadful, aren’t they?”</p>, <p>It was a horrific garment he had fashioned himself using human skin he had peeled off.</p>, <p>Of course, this wasn’t skin crafted in any proper manner through tanning.</p>, <p>It was skin forcibly torn from bodies, stretched and pieced together into a patchwork. Some parts still had flesh attached and others were dripping with blood.</p>, <p>Moreover… his face was covered with a ghastly mask made from the peeled-off skin of another person’s face.</p>, <p>“Grrrrr…”</p>, <p>Although he was wearing human skin, what came out of his mouth was an animal-like growl.</p>, <p>Any ordinary person would lose their sanity just by witnessing this bizarre and horrific scene.</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated. The effect of intimidation has been nullified.]</p>, <p>However, this posed no significant issue for me. It’s not that I’m without weaknesses, but as long as I possess the [Madness of the Abyss] trait, nothing can inflict harm upon my mind or soul.</p>, <p>But there’s something off about Je Mu-gyeong… Even though he was always unhinged, he retained enough sanity to respond when spoken to.</p>, <p>That’s why I had planned to confront him alone and not with Curtain Call. There were things I needed to ask him, things that needed clarification.</p>, <p>Yet, my plan had gone awry.</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong now was far more deranged than anything depicted in the game.</p>, <p>Still, it might be worth trying to talk with him one more time…</p>, <p>“Hey, mask buddy.”</p>, <p>At that moment, his body tensed even more.</p>, <p>It wasn’t fear.</p>, <p>It was the movement of a beast gathering its strength to pounce on its prey.</p>, <p>The bloodshot eyes visible through the slits of the skin mask gleamed with intense madness.</p>, <p>“This is…”</p>, <p>Oh, he speaks.</p>, <p>“This is mine! It’s my face! I can’t give it to you!”</p>, <p>Ah… I see, I understand.</p>, <p>Who else but I could understand him? Aren’t we both mad in our own ways?</p>, <p>To be precise, Je Mu-gyeong suffered from an obsession with human skin. It was different from my obsession with masks…. Though his condition was worse than mine.</p>, <p>“Alright, you can keep that.”</p>, <p>“No! Nooooo!”</p>, <p>But why did he burst into a fit the moment we met?</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong slowly got up and screamed. His eyes flashed with madness and… fear?</p>, <p>“Ah! Aaaaah! This monster… monster! Do not look at me with those dreadful eyes! Do not gaze upon me with your four eyes! Demon from the abyss! You can’t touch me!”</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>Monster? Demon? Did he, like Jang Hyeon-deok, go mad at the sight of my mask in an instant?</p>, <p>“I need skin to wrap around me. I must be enveloped in skin imbued with their souls and spirits…! Pain and despair will protect me! The apostle of Yog-Sothoth promised to take me away!”</p>, <p>No, it wasn’t because of the mask.</p>, <p>The content of his words was too strange to be simply about the mask.</p>, <p>“I have seen it! We must journey to that distant realm, the cradle of life, the sanctuary of souls! Beyond the horizon lies a place that is our world yet not our world! A haven without veils, filled with the calm and quiet unknown, to which we must depart!”</p>, <p>Hold on. These words were something I never heard even in the game. What was he talking about?</p>, <p>A place that is our world yet not our world? A haven filled with the calm and quiet unknown?</p>, <p>“We must escape this twisted, ruined, decaying, and crumbling world! We must leave! We must set out on a journey! Urghhh!”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>White foam trickled from the corners of his mouth.</p>, <p><em>Shrrrrrr</em>…</p>, <p>[System: The ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ trait has been activated.]</p>, <p>Before I knew it, he was holding a vicious chain in his hand. So much for dialogue; was it straight into battle mode now?</p>, <p>The USB wasn’t the issue. I needed to figure out where he got this nonsense from and what had led him to spout such madness.</p>, <p>At that moment, Je Mu-gyeong started to move violently while swinging the chain with ferocity.</p>, <p><em>Whoooosh!!!</em></p>, <p>The chain flew through the air as if it were tearing through a wall of air itself.</p>, <p>“Holy shit!”</p>, <p>Crazy, was this the sound a chain was supposed to make?</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>Transparent protective circles formed at a speed faster than the incoming chains.</p>, <p>I already knew he was unreasonably strong. A single layer wouldn’t be enough to stop him.</p>, <p><em>Crack, crack, crack!!!</em></p>, <p>I managed to form five protective circles, but four of them were shredded like paper.</p>, <p>“Tch, can’t we just talk, mask to mask!”</p>, <p>From within the sackcloth wrapped around Je Mu-gyeong, two additional arms emerged.</p>, <p>A powerful body covered with bursting muscles.</p>, <p>Unlike other test subjects, his four arms were symmetrically and proportionately attached.</p>, <p>And each hand had six fingers.</p>, <p>This reminded me of the creature I had seen in the pharmaceutical warehouse, the type D biological tissue sample. He looked like that small creature. Well, It wasn’t an exact match, but it seemed like that monstrous creature could grow into something resembling Je Mu-gyeong’s current form.</p>, <p>It was inevitable.</p>, <p><em>If those little monsters were to grow up, they’d turn into Je Mu-gyeongs.</em></p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong was the most terrible failure and, paradoxically, the only success among the specimens created in the [Ga-5060 Secret Research Facility] disguised as an abandoned hospital.</p>, <p>And what I had secured in the glass bottle was a clone of Je Mu-gyeong. It might be an unpleasant term, but it wouldn’t be wrong to call it his offspring.</p>, <p>Anyway, talking was now out of the question.</p>, <p>I had thought it to be the most cost-effective strategy if it could succeed, but the worst outcome awaited me.</p>, <p>It was time to set aside any notion of dialogue and proceed with what I had originally intended to do.</p>, <p>I needed to seize the USB that was somewhere on him.</p>, <p>To do that…</p>, <p><em>Use only spells that won’t damage the USB while dealing with such an enemy?</em></p>, <p>I had assured Curtain Call that I could handle it alone, but it was no easy task.</p>, <p>Recklessly unleashing lightning or any other potentially explosive attack could destroy the program contained within the USB.</p>, <p>And that wasn’t the end of it.</p>, <p>The sackcloth he was wrapped in was not just for show.</p>, <p>It was an artifact created at the cost of mythical madness and exquisite ritual steeped in the lore of the Cthulhu Mythos.</p>, <p>As long as he wore it, Je Mu-gyeong would possess a strong resistance to magic.</p>, <p>This item was on a completely different level from the local area magic nullification that Leopard from earlier could barely produce.</p>, <p><em>There are degrees to handicap matches!</em></p>, <p>I decided to put some distance between us.</p>, <p>If I got caught by that monstrous mass of muscle, I would be instantly reduced to minced meat.</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>Dazzling patterns of light begin to bloom on my clothes.</p>, <p><em>Paaa—</em></p>, <p>I leaped backward.</p>, <p>A long trail of light followed my movement.</p>, <p>The gap between the creature and me widened and I quickly found myself outside the room.</p>, <p>The corridor wasn’t particularly spacious, but it was far better than the cramped surgery room, which was no place to fight an opponent like this.</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong was momentarily shaking with an uneasy expression before he charged at me while swinging his chains.</p>, <p>On the additional arms attached to his side, a large hammer and a saw somehow appeared.</p>, <p>“Ah, just give me a moment to regroup!”</p>, <p>[Lock]</p>, <p><em>Crash!</em></p>, <p>I used my magic to shut the door.</p>, <p>Then, I poured more magical power into reinforcing the door.</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Metal Heating]</p>, <p>A double barrier was set up on the surgery room door, which began to glow red-hot due to the intense heat forcibly applied to it. Could it hold for a minute? No, perhaps just 30 seconds?</p>, <p><em>Boom!!!</em></p>, <p>Damn it, shouldn’t he at least stop for ten seconds out of courtesy?</p>, <p>It wasn’t just the door; the walls surrounding the door were also torn apart.</p>, <p>Amidst hurling the walls and door, Je Mu-gyeong spouted bizarre words with a deranged expression on his face as if he had gone mad.</p>, <p>“I must escape this world… I must get out… Help me… Lend me that skin…!”</p>, <p>“Ah, yes, that’s exactly what I wanted to talk about! Um… but what did you say you wanted to borrow?”</p>, <p>“Skin! The skin! Give me that skin! Give me your skin!”</p>, <p>The sound of chains clattering filled the air as the iron hook flew towards me.</p>, <p>“Thunder… No! [Chains of Domination]!”</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>Seven strands of iron chains formed in all directions, each emitting a dazzling golden light as they seized Je Mu-gyeong’s iron hook.</p>, <p>“Ugh, quite heavy…!”</p>, <p><strong>Stop.</strong></p>, <p>The iron hook came to a halt in mid-air with a grating sound of metal. For a moment, Je Mu-gyeong seemed taken aback by the unexpected turn of events.</p>, <p>“Hey! Je Mu-gyeong! Skin man! Skin!”</p>, <p>Ah, I was so rushed that I couldn’t form a proper sentence. Before Je Mu-gyeong could say anything else, I managed to complete my thought.</p>, <p>“You know what it is! Tell me! What is needed to escape this world?”</p>, <p>That’s right, Je Mu-gyeong could know. Because…</p>, <p>“Yes… Yes… I know. I can tear through the veil that covers this world and set off beyond that distant sea of stars, to the deep, deep abyss that exists beyond that, to the calm and quiet unknown land beyond that!”</p>, <p>“Ah, well done! Yes, you can do it, Je Mu-gyeong!”</p>, <p>Yes, Je Mu-gyeong possessed a unique ability.</p>, <p>Originally, he had the ability to glimpse beyond the veil that enveloped the world of [Cthulhu World]. Helistic’s crazy scientists had infused his body with the DNA of various species and the fluids of abyssal beings, transforming Je Mu-gyeong into a being that was no longer human.</p>, <p>“They revealed it to me. Those who walk between dimensions and have the wisdom of the abyss and the power of the other world told me! They accepted me as one of their own, as part of their kin. They whispered to me the way to escape this world! A way to escape from this world where destruction is approaching, where even death itself will perish in the approaching abyss!”</p>, <p>So, what the hell is that supposed to mean?</p>, <p>The answer that came after such a long wait was… fu*k. It was just absurd nonsense.</p>, <p>“A mage who gained infinite wisdom, magic, and madness after gazing into the abyss. The only way is to skin that mage and wear his skin. That’s all there is to it!”</p>, <p>At that moment, Je Mu-gyeong’s form began to blur. The tension in the chains slackened. Oh, shit!</p>, <p>Before I could react, Je Mu-gyeong had completely vanished.</p>, <p>Reborn through the modifications of Helistic, Je Mu-gyeong became a monster who could hear the whispers from beyond the dimensions, tear through the veil on his own, and move to the other side of dimensions at will.</p>, <p>A dimensional species created by human hands. That is what Je Mu-gyeong is.</p>, <p><em>He hasn’t moved far.</em></p>, <p>However, Je Mu-gyeong who was merely a prototype, lacked the energy and magical power to freely leap between dimensions and depart for other worlds. I retrieved the magical power contained in the chains of domination and expanded my senses.</p>, <p><em>Behind the wall?</em></p>, <p>I detected his magical power along with the sound of clanging chains right beyond the wall behind my back.</p>, <p><em>Crack! Crunch!</em></p>, <p>Before I could do anything, Je Mu-gyeong burst through the wall behind me. He was charging at me with a creepy large saw that emitted a flashing light.</p>, <p>It was a headlong rush with a large saw leading the way.</p>, <p>“Aaah, piece of shit…!”</p>, <p>With a body boasting a mere agility of 8, it was an attack of absurd speed and force that was simply too fast for me to properly react.</p>, <p>To naively trust in a protective circle and face it head-on would be fatal!</p>, <p>[The unique effect of the L-rank accessory ‘Carcosa’s Mask’, ‘Dreamy Blur’, has been activated.</p>, <p>// Dreamy Blur: Automatically casts ‘Blink’ spell]</p>, <p>I felt a strange feeling of the mask covering my face pulling me away.</p>, <p>The space around me twisted. The magic imbued in the mask teleported me to a different location in an instant.</p>, <p>The activation of Blink, a top-tier survival spell that allowed for short-distance teleportation in dangerous moments, had saved me.</p>, <p>[Blink complete. Cooldown: 864,000 seconds]</p>, <p>His attack sliced through the air in vain.</p>, <p>In the next moment, I found myself appearing right behind Je Mu-gyeong.</p>, <p>With his intended target suddenly vanished, he lost his balance and stumbled forward.</p>, <p>It was an attack launched with tremendous force.</p>, <p>He could not overcome the momentum that pushed him onward and crashed into the wall….is what I thought would happen, but instead, he swung his four arms and pounded the ground.</p>, <p><em>Boooom!</em></p>, <p>This recoil stopped his charge in its tracks.</p>, <p>What kind of monster was this?</p>, <p>No, that’s not right. He didn’t move like this in the game. He wasn’t this strong, nor did he attack so recklessly.</p>, <p><em>Something’s different from the game.</em></p>, <p>It reminded me of my last encounter with Lee Chang-hyeok. In the game, Lee Chang-hyeok transformed into an absurd monster by opening the bag that couldn’t be opened within the game.</p>, <p>A strength and madness far different from his game settings.</p>, <p><em>This guy must have opened something that couldn’t be opened in the game, or seen something that couldn’t be seen in the game, right?</em></p>, <p>And then there were the other recent incidents: the ghoul shaman, Jang Hyeon-deok, and now Je Mu-gyeong alongside Curtain Call.</p>, <p>NPCs deviating from their game settings. It’s not certain, but Je Mu-gyeong’s complete breakdown probably occurred around the same time as the other NPCs.</p>, <p>“Je Mu-gyeong, you crazy bastard! Stop obsessing over your damn skin and tell me the real way! How can I escape this world?”</p>, <p>“You need to hammer a hook into the top of the head, carve a slit in the chest, and start from the mouth to peel off the skin. All these must be done while the subject is still alive.”</p>, <p>What are you saying? Are you going to skin me alive?</p>, <p>“What are you saying! Be reasonable, you lunatic!”</p>, <p><em>Whooosh!</em></p>, <p>With utter disregard for dialogue, he suddenly hurled a hammer at me. This damned bastard.</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p>[Spell Amplification: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Crash! Baang!</em></p>, <p>With no time to dodge or block, I launched an energy arrow enhanced with explosive power.</p>, <p>Thanks to my precise control over my magical power, the Arrow of Destruction exploded at the perfect timing and angle and managed to alter the trajectory of the hammer.</p>, <p>“Agh…”</p>, <p>Conversely, it could be said that barely altering its course was all I could manage.</p>, <p>But the hammer wasn’t the end of it. Before I knew it, he leaped forward with tremendous physical force, creating an impact that was enough to shatter the floor.</p>, <p><em>Boooom!</em></p>, <p>“Good grief…”</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong’s massive body, armed with a saw flew towards me. Wait, this timing is off; this could be dangerous. This attack carried even more destructive power than the previous charge. Blink was already used up. I had to choose the fastest spell I could activate despite the potential loss…</p>, <p>“Heaaaaaad!!”</p>, <p>At that moment, a bright red flash came out of nowhere and flew towards Je Mu-gyeong’s head</p>, <p>White hair stained and mottled with blood, a cool leather jacket that still managed to shine with a red gloss, and a zanbato sword larger than the giant saw that Je Mu-gyeong was holding.</p>, <p>It was Curtain Call. Just as her overhead strike was about to impale Je-mukyeong’s head, he grabbed the hammer lying on the ground and blocked her attack.</p>, <p><em>Claaanggg!!!</em></p>]\n",

            "[<p>Curtain Call’s habit of announcing her attacks may be because she had a strange obsession. However, the reason she was able to maintain her reputation as a promising fixer was because her opponents would often be cleaved in two as they clumsily defended her attacks.</p>, <p>Curtain Call demonstrated her incredible skill by slicing Je Mu-gyeong’s crude hammer vertically in two.</p>, <p>However, Je Mu-gyeong grasped the bisected hammer with both hands and swung it fiercely, managing to deflect Curtain Call’s assault. He then used his remaining strength to launch an attack on Curtain Call with his other two arms.</p>, <p>“Hwaaaap!”</p>, <p>Letting out a fierce battle cry mid-air, Curtain Call coiled her body and forcefully plunged her zanbato into the ground. She then yanked on the zanbato and launched both herself and her weapon through the air. Such movements showcased an uncanny strength far beyond what seemed physically possible for someone of her weight and height.</p>, <p>For a brief moment, the battle between these two monsters raged on.</p>, <p>Curtain Call made use of her small size and overwhelming strength as she started darting in all directions. She looked like a small whirlwind with a huge blade attached to it.</p>, <p><em>Clang-clang-clang-clang!</em></p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong managed to block Curtain Call’s attack with his chains, but the assault was far from over. Curtain Call spun around with renewed vigor and repeatedly struck Je Mu-gyeong’s chains. The zanbato she wielded was swung not so much to slice as it was hammered down like a blacksmith’s hammer pounding on an anvil, creating a shower of sparks as it clashed with the chains.</p>, <p>“Die, die, die, die!!! Bleed out all your blood and die!!!!”</p>, <p>However, their entanglement was short-lived. Je Mu-gyeong’s abilities were not limited to his immense strength and the four arms that moved at will.</p>, <p>Suddenly, Je Mu-gyeong’s figure blurred and then disappeared altogether.</p>, <p>With her weight shifted too much on the zanbato, Curtain Call swung at thin air, lost her balance, and her posture crumbled.</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong then emerged from a blind spot with his hammer already brandished in his hand and the huge hammer was now hurtling towards Curtain Call.</p>, <p>Holy shit. Stop it, brute!</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p>I launched a fireball towards Je Mu-gyeong in an attempt to protect Curtain Call. The sackcloth made from human skin provided Je Mu-gyeong with remarkable magical defense, but it wasn’t impervious to the impact.</p>, <p><em>Boooom!!</em></p>, <p>I was concerned that the explosion might damage the USB he possessed so the blast was intentionally contained. The explosion spread only as far as Je Mu-gyeong’s head and this alone was insufficient to inflict a fatal wound on him.</p>, <p>“It seems trying to extract any information through dialogue is now off the table.”</p>, <p>I had been foolish to even attempt dialogue. Wasting energy on such futile stuff was a mistake. It was time to give up and look for another way to clear the quest.</p>, <p>But how? The magical defenses of the sackcloth he wore remained intact, and until I could seize the USB he possessed, burning, crushing, or incinerating him was not an option.</p>, <p>And a single mistake would reduce me to just another set of dismembered remains scattered throughout this corridor.</p>, <p><em>Ah, dismembered remains?</em></p>, <p>There was a simpler way, after all.</p>, <p>…I had hoped to avoid resorting to such measures, but there seemed no other choice.</p>, <p>I conjured a temporary telekinetic force and pulled out an artifact from my backpack before I started conjuring a magic circle.</p>, <p>Dozens of sinister purple magic circles imbued with the malevolent power of the netherworld formed and started spreading a chilling mist of ominous energy in all directions.</p>, <p><em>Hssss…</em></p>, <p>[Plea of the Starving Dead]</p>, <p>An unpleasant sulfuric stench filled the air, accompanied by bell-like sounds that seemed almost hallucinatory.</p>, <p><em>Ding, ding,</em></p>, <p>The corpses strewn across the corridor began to twitch.</p>, <p>After absorbing my magical power, the artifact I had activated, the silver bell of the underworld defied the established laws and raised the dead scattered around.</p>, <p>Feed your hunger, you who died bearing grudges.</p>, <p><em>– Guoooo…</em></p>, <p><em>– Kuuuuuu…</em></p>, <p>Most of the bodies in the corridor began to stir.</p>, <p>Those crazy bastards had cut them into pieces so much that only a few of them had enough of their limbs intact to stand.</p>, <p>This spell wasn’t the one to conjure the “zombies” one might typically imagine.</p>, <p>Creating undead that moved under my command, like zombies, would require far more conditions.</p>, <p>These beings would not heed any command other than to exact retribution upon those who had killed them.</p>, <p>Moreover, the consumption of magical power was ridiculously inefficient and the duration was far too short.</p>, <p><em>But what does it matter? Right now, all I have is magical power.</em></p>, <p>[The unique effect of the S-rank magical tool ‘Silver Bell of the Underworld ’, ‘Pure Silver’s Madness’, has been activated.</p>, <p>// Pure Silver’s Madness: Grants ‘Mental Illness—Violence’ to summoned creatures and increases their attack power by 100%.]</p>, <p>Artificially raised corpses rushed towards their target, driven by immense hatred and hunger.</p>, <p>Those without legs crawled and those without arms charged forward using their teeth and skulls.

I had already seen Curtain Call moving.</p>, <p>“Heaaaaaad!!!”</p>, <p>It was unclear where the head was on the iron hook, but Curtain Call’s sword flew in like lightning and struck down the approaching hook, allowing me to complete the magic I had prepared.</p>, <p>“Arghhh!”</p>, <p>Dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of intestine strands had completely entwined around Je Mu-gyeong’s body.</p>, <p>Even with increased strength, could they stop him for more than 10 seconds? No, perhaps not even 5 seconds. He thrashed and flailed around like a freshly caught fish.</p>, <p>But before he could escape the entanglement of intestines… found it!</p>, <p>One of the intestines crawling over his body finally discovered the USB hidden within his grasp.</p>, <p>Swiftly, the intestines moved to snatch the USB from him.</p>, <p>Good, there were no more items left to take.</p>, <p>“Hey, have you had fun so far?”</p>, <p>Now, it was my turn.</p>, <p>The intestines that had been restraining Je Mu-gyeong’s movements began to snap.</p>, <p>But at this point, intestines or such were of no use to me.</p>, <p>[Cold Explosion]</p>, <p><em>Hiss! Crack!</em></p>, <p>Waves of ice magic exploded in all directions.</p>, <p>The blood and bodily fluids leaking from the corpses’ bodies instantly froze and turned into bright red blades of blood.</p>, <p><em>Crackle!</em></p>, <p>“I will strip away your wisdom, your very soul!”</p>, <p>Ah, seriously. What about my skin?</p>, <p>The ice magic I conjured devoured even his pouring blood before transforming it into crimson blades of ice. Despite the tightening grip of these icy blades piercing and slashing at his body, Je Mu-gyeong’s charge did not falter.</p>, <p>Truly, it was the charge of a madman.</p>, <p>I too did not stop but constructed a new magic circle. It was a blazing red magic circle made up of bright red runes.</p>, <p>[The unique effect of the S-rank accessory ‘Ring of Corrupted Flame’ has been activated. ‘Red Element Concentration’ and ‘Legacy of Fire Knowledge’ has been activated</p>, <p>// Red Element Concentration: Increases the effectiveness of all fire-type spells by 50%.</p>, <p>// Legacy of Fire Knowledge: Enhances understanding of ‘fire-type magic’.]</p>, <p>[Hellfire]</p>, <p>Whoooooooooosh!</p>, <p>Roaring flames burst forth like the breath of a dragon, twisting and forming into a massive whirlwind that surged toward him with ferocity.</p>, <p><em>Booooom!</em></p>, <p>But with a mere wave of his four arms, he pushed back the storm of heat.</p>, <p>Ah, that damned magic resistance!</p>, <p>[Ice Spear]</p>, <p><em>Crasssssh!</em></p>, <p>Spears of blood ice erupted from beneath his feet.

Crackle!</em></p>, <p>He was unable to dodge the sudden lightning strike.</p>, <p>“Argh…”</p>, <p>It was but a moment of stiffness, yet it created a fatal opening.</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>A magical hand that exerted telekinetic power threw an object that had been hidden until now.</p>, <p>It was Valusia’s Blue Elixir.</p>, <p><em>Whizzzzzz!</em></p>, <p>The bottle reached above his head, and at that precise moment, the magic was activated.</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p><em>Bang!</em></p>, <p>The bottle was hit by a bolt of netherworld energy and was easily shattered.</p>, <p><em>Ssssshhh…</em></p>, <p>[Valusia’s Blue Elixir (S-rank Catalyst): One of the potions used by the ancient serpent people. It contains a corrosively potent poison that can be deadly, so it’s dangerous to use without proper purification.]</p>, <p>A corrosive poison that was capable of effortlessly dissolving human skin was unleashed on him.</p>, <p><em>Chiieeeeeek—</em></p>, <p>The skin that covered his body began to melt away.</p>, <p>“Aaaargh! No! Stop! Don’t do this! My skin! I can’t be without my skin!”</p>, <p>Madness, confusion, terror, and despair filled his eyes.</p>, <p>Any sane person would have stripped off the skin tainted with the corrosive poison.</p>, <p>But even though the poison threatened to seep beyond the sin and into his very flesh, he did not do so.</p>, <p>A bitter feeling arose within me.</p>, <p><em>Perhaps I could end up like that too.</em></p>, <p>This madness and obsession were beyond my control.</p>, <p>The mask made of human skin that was covering Je Mu-gyeong’s face was now gone.</p>, <p>Although his bare body was revealed after losing the mask and sackcloth, I still couldn’t discern his features.</p>, <p>This was because the corrosive poison had melted away half of his face, along with the mask.</p>, <p>Anyway, the artifact that had been protecting him was now gone.</p>, <p>[Burning Spear]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p><em>Shiiiiiek—</em></p>, <p>Four spears created by condensing flames flew forward.</p>, <p>And it was at that moment that I saw it.</p>, <p>The look in his eyes changed.</p>, <p>“Uh… Aaah!”</p>, <p><em>Crack!!</em></p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong screamed as he intercepted the spears of flame.</p>, <p>He swung his saw and arm to knock two aside and twisted his body to dodge another, but it wasn’t perfect.</p>, <p><em>Crack.</em></p>, <p>The last spear of flame he couldn’t evade pierced through his body.</p>, <p>Even the hand that had swatted the spears wasn’t unscathed.

Ptui….”</p>, <p>Instead of answering, he spat out a clot of blood and then raised his saw.</p>, <p>“You have a hole in your stomach, and you still want to continue?”</p>, <p>“It is true that I momentarily lost control of my mind, but the knowledge I have come to understand is not false. This world is a hell on the brink of destruction. For those who cannot escape, what remains is a life worse than death. There is only the terrible despair of neither death nor life.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… I have something I want to ask about that.”</p>, <p>“Are you crazy, Kim Shin-hwa? Do you have no sense of the situation?”</p>, <p>The voice of Curtain Call rose up sharply. Oh, please. Anyway, I still have questions that need to be resolved.</p>, <p>But Je Mu-gyeong responded with a firm voice.</p>, <p>“All I want from you is your skin.”</p>, <p>Ah, this guy is really crazy. Still harping on about the skin?</p>, <p>He seemed to have broken free from his delirium, yet his obsession and madness had not faded.</p>, <p>He had gazed into the abyss in his own way.</p>, <p>“Let me tell you something, though… I know what you seek in the USB you took from me. What lies beyond will be of no help to you.”</p>, <p>What did he mean? Ah, I see. I understand now.</p>, <p>I realized why Je Mu-gyeong was waiting for me in a state of madness even more intense than what I had seen in the game.</p>, <p>“Je Mu-gyeong! You saw that book….in the basement, didn’t you?”</p>, <p>Among the hidden rewards available in this hospital was a grimoire.</p>, <p>I even remember the title clearly.</p>, <p>It was called “The Silent Scripture of the Dreaming Path”.</p>, <p>The message window at that time had described it as a book containing information about the afterlife and the world of dreams and how to achieve enlightenment.</p>, <p>The powers it conferred, and the madness it induced, were far more extreme than anything portrayed by the game’s lore.</p>, <p>It was unmistakable that the knowledge gained from reading that book had led to his current state.</p>, <p>“That book… I should not have read it… There is knowledge in this world that we do not need to possess, knowledge that is unnecessary for living in this world… From the knowledge in that book, I became aware of the power of dimensional species and heard the voices… coming from the abyss…”</p>, <p>This was a world in [Cthulhu World] that was completely different from the world I lived in.</p>, <p>In this place, there were only hideous truths and wisdom steeped in despair.</p>, <p>Premature enlightenment does nothing but shatter fragile minds.</p>, <p>Now, he is pleading with me to end his life.</p>, <p>If I refuse, I might find myself killed with my skin stripped away.</p>, <p>Perhaps, as he believes, flaying my skin might create a means to escape this world… But for now, it seems like a temporary comfort.</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong adopted a stance entirely different from before.</p>, <p>This must be his true posture for attack.</p>, <p>It was a stark contrast from the frenzied rush of a madman who relied solely on brute strength and momentum.</p>, <p>Perhaps, since my arrival here, the setting of the [Cthulhu World] has started to diverge from that of the game?</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong inciting the test subjects to rebel was within the scope of the game’s setting.</p>, <p>However, reading the grimoire in the meantime and gaining strength far beyond what was predetermined, along with an even more potent madness, was certainly beyond the intended scope of the setting.</p>, <p>Perhaps because he thought there was no need to say anything more, he changed his stance and stepped forward.</p>, <p><em>Thud!</em></p>, <p>His body flew away with a dull impact sound that made the entire building vibrate.</p>, <p>The assault continued with charge after charge, but this time it was utterly different.</p>, <p>His body was damaged, and he had but a single weapon left… yet I instinctively knew this attack was the most dangerous of them all.</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Spell Amplification: Multicasting]</p>, <p>[Frost Wall].</p>, <p>[Hardening]</p>, <p>Five layers of protective circles and a wall made of frozen blood collected from corpses block his path.</p>, <p><em>Baaaang!</em></p>, <p>But all of these defensive spells shattered laughably.</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>One must not remain in the same spot.</p>, <p>I had to move fast, faster still.</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Impact]</p>, <p>I executed a double jump in the expanse of thin air and then kicked off the wall to propel myself further.</p>, <p><em>Crash! Boom-boom-boom!</em></p>, <p>His attack flew to the spot where I was standing a second ago, if not a millisecond ago.</p>, <p>Any attempt to evade his blows based on mere sight was a sure path towards death.</p>, <p>By this time, the area was filled with my magical power.</p>, <p>Everything must be judged by the sensation of reading magical power, not by sight and hearing.</p>, <p>Even his formidable destructive power originated from his own magical power.</p>, <p>His will directed the flow of his magic; I needed to intercept and respond with my own spells at a speed that surpassed what he could realize through his will.</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p>I slipped in some offensive magic between leaps. I didn’t even have the time to strengthen the spells.</p>, <p>My painstakingly cast magic was effortlessly severed by a mere swipe of his saw as if cutting through air.</p>, <p>Still, I couldn’t stop. I had to scatter the simplest and quickest spells I could muster, with relentless speed.</p>, <p><em>Whooooosh!</em></p>, <p>Ice shards scattered in all directions.</p>, <p>Streams of lightning forked out in dozens of directions, followed by arrows of glowing magical power soaring through the air.</p>, <p>Yet, all those spells were swept away by a single monstrous wave of his saw.</p>, <p>Ice pillars were sliced in an instant, lightning was deflected, and a few arrows were simply taken head-on as he charged forward.</p>, <p>It seemed like an endless exchange, but the first to tire was not me, but Je Mu-gyeong.</p>, <p><em>It’s humanly wrong to fight this long with a gaping hole in your stomach.</em></p>, <p>He had to pause momentarily to vomit the blood that was welling up in his mouth.</p>, <p>Three seconds? No, it must have been about a second.</p>, <p>That was enough.</p>, <p>[Fireball]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p>A huge fireball was hurtled towards him.</p>, <p>It was too big to fend off. In the end, he chose to dodge… but it was all according to plan.</p>, <p>As he evaded, a second fireball was already on its way to where he had moved.</p>, <p>Launched right after the first, it completely cornered him. There was no escape!</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>The huge fireball exploded around him.</p>, <p>Fierce flames and a blast.</p>, <p>[Earthquake Strike]</p>, <p><em>Rumble… Boom!</em></p>, <p>It was a spell designed to shake the ground and cause it to collapse.</p>, <p>This was the third floor, where stable ground was non-existent.</p>, <p>The floor, which had repeatedly been forcibly frozen and burned, was already at its limit.</p>, <p>Unable to withstand the vibrations, the floor cracked open.</p>, <p>Collapse!</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p>“Kuaaaaaa!”</p>, <p>The floor gave way, and rocks fell with it, and the massive figure of Je Mu-gyeong plummeted to the second floor.</p>, <p>Phew… There was nothing I needed on the second floor. It wouldn’t matter if it all burned down.</p>, <p>[Burning Spear]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Strength Increase]</p>, <p>A large magic circle formed horizontally in the air, facing the hole through which he had fallen.</p>, <p>To subdue him, an incredibly powerful attack was necessary.</p>, <p>From the large magic circle, with a diameter of 2 meters, a spear of absurd proportions was launched.</p>, <p>It was more akin to a pillar or a tower than a spear, such was the scale of the magic.</p>, <p><em>Rumble-rumble…</em></p>, <p><em>Whooooooooooosh!</em></p>, <p>A pillar of flame struck him, unleashing an immense amount of fire in all directions.</p>, <p>The entire second floor was engulfed in flames.</p>, <p>The erupted flames then moved according to my will and condensed into a whirlwind of fire.</p>, <p>Everything trapped inside was reduced to ash, leaving not even a trace behind.</p>, <p>Standing on the third floor, I was blasted by fierce hot winds. The heat was so intense that even my [Flame Resistance] couldn’t fully block it.</p>, <p>It felt like an eternity of death had passed.</p>, <p>Now, there was nothing left on the second floor.</p>, <p>Everything caught in the massive whirlwind of fire was burned to dust, leaving behind only small embers and ash swirling like dust.</p>, <p>A strangely shaped scorch mark lay where Je Mu-gyeong previously stood, which remained to indicate his demise in this place.</p>, <p>“Phew… This was no easy feat.”</p>, <p>The issue wasn’t the power.</p>, <p>I had perfectly controlled the heat and flames to prevent the building from catching fire.</p>, <p>It was a surreal level of control that transcended the limits allowed to second-order mages.</p>, <p>I think I’m more exhausted because of that… Next time, it would be better to fight outdoors if possible.</p>, <p>The remaining enemies were now…</p>, <p>[Achievement Unlocked!

            "[<p>“What’s going on, Kim Shin-hwa? Why are you like that?”</p>, <p>It was Curtain Call who said that.</p>, <p>From her perspective, it must have seemed odd for me to stand still while gazing into the empty air. And with a mask on, it would have been impossible to guess what I was thinking.</p>, <p>“No, wait. Just give me a moment.”</p>, <p>“You look like you’re seeing a hallucination.”</p>, <p>I doubted she could see my expression under the mask, but Curtain Call’s observation was so spot-on that I hesitated for a moment before mumbling a response.</p>, <p>“Well… it’s not that. It’s because I’m a mage.”</p>, <p>There were many things about mages that warriors didn’t grasp, so that should suffice. Sure enough, Curtain Call seemed to contemplate this for a moment before nodding her head in agreement.</p>, <p>“Right, because you’re a mage. I’ll wait.”</p>, <p>[How long can your previous knowledge protect you? As long as the beings from the abyss are watching, the day may come when that very knowledge turns into a curse. Yet, you might overcome even such obstacles.</p>, <p>Remember, time is running out!]</p>, <p>…Go ahead, pour on the scorn. Well, the message displayed isn’t entirely incorrect. Someday, the knowledge I’ve relied on might indeed become a curse. That’s all the more reason to understand how this world is changing and where it is heading.</p>, <p>Turning my head, I saw Curtain Call waiting with a look of boredom on her face.</p>, <p>This one is also a puzzle I need to solve… But for now, we are allies, albeit temporarily, as there was still some unfinished business we have to do.</p>, <p>“It’s over now.”</p>, <p>“Really? What were you saying?”</p>, <p>…Does this woman know something?</p>, <p>“Who said what?”</p>, <p>“Weren’t you talking to the friend in your head?”</p>, <p>I almost misunderstood her but it turned out to be a different conversation.</p>, <p>“I can’t claim my mind is entirely sound, but I’m not mad in that way, so don’t worry.”</p>, <p>“Is that so? How boring.”</p>, <p>“Sorry for making you wait, but we need to get moving. The manager of Helistic might barge in at any moment.”</p>, <p>“We’re off to extract data from the lab, right?”</p>, <p>“Exactly.”</p>, <p>“I’m not cut out for that sort of thing, so I’m counting on you.”</p>, <p>“It’s not a big deal.”</p>, <p>“Yeah, yeah. Let’s go, come on.”</p>, <p>Curtain Call responded with a lack of enthusiasm and picked up her magic sword.</p>, <p>To prepare for any contingencies, I created a magical alarm and attached it to the window, and I was surrounded by protective spells as we moved.</p>, <p>The building, already in disarray from the stir caused by the test subjects, became even more dreadful with the marks of battle left by Curtain Call and me.</p>, <p>Fireballs, tidal waves, lightning strikes, earthquakes, and even holes in the floor—some of which went down to the first level. Through one such hole, the crushed wreck of a car was visible.</p>, <p>The third floor was littered with completely torn bodies.</p>, <p>“You’ve really turned this place upside down, Kim Shin-hwa.”</p>, <p>“Well, I’m at a loss for words.”</p>, <p>Even I had gone so far as to turn them into zombies, and I extracted their organs to use them as weapons, which made the chaos on the third floor even more horrific than when I first entered this place.</p>, <p>Everywhere, there were gruesome clumps formed by a mixture of charred black fluid, flesh, blood, and viscera.</p>, <p>All of this was my doing, but I had indeed gone to extreme lengths.</p>, <p>It was astonishing that the building was still standing intact.</p>, <p>Before long, we reached the office of the laboratory director which was located in the most secluded corner of the third floor.</p>, <p>As this room housed some of the most crucial and sensitive information in the building, it was secured with a specially reinforced security system, unlike other parts of the hospital.</p>, <p>“Only this wall is still in good condition?”</p>, <p>“The inner side of this wall is reinforced with metal. It’s like they’ve created a sort of bomb shelter.”</p>, <p>“Then, is it possible that the director is hiding here?”</p>, <p>“No. Since the face skin that Je Mu-gyeong was wearing belonged to the director, that’s unlikely.”</p>, <p>“Ah, that face was the director’s?”</p>, <p>“Yes.”</p>, <p>Moreover, this room was equipped with its own power supply and server and it was completely isolated from the outside.</p>, <p>If only this room remained intact, the dual contract quest could proceed without any issues.</p>, <p>The door was locked, but at this point, that was merely a trivial thing.</p>, <p>I didn’t even pause in my stride towards the door before casting a spell.</p>, <p>[Unlock]</p>, <p><em>Click.</em></p>, <p><em>Creaaaaaaak….</em></p>, <p>Unless magically sealed, there was no door I couldn’t open.</p>, <p>And even if it was magically sealed, it would only be a matter of time before it could be bypassed. It wasn’t a significant obstacle.</p>, <p>“What? It doesn’t open with that USB?”</p>, <p>“No, the USB is needed to access the main computer.”</p>, <p>“This is unnecessarily complicated. What’s all this about?”</p>, <p>The director’s office was a very typical and outdated setup.</p>, <p>There was a large leather sofa, a bookshelf filled with volumes, and a desk with a computer on it.</p>, <p>There were bloodstains and books scattered randomly around the place. A large executive chair that had been beside the desk was now tipped over and pushed to the far corner.</p>, <p>The traces of Je Mu-gyeong’s visit were all clear to see.</p>, <p>However, compared to other areas of the hospital, it could be considered relatively tidy.</p>, <p>There was no real need to investigate this room further.</p>, <p>Unless one was specifically interested in undeniable evidence of Helistic’s involvement in the facility or the research processes of the test subjects, there wasn’t much else to see.</p>, <p>Helistic was a corporation of mad scientists researching eternal life, immortality, and the supernatural potential of humans.</p>, <p>Well, anyway!</p>, <p>I set the overturned executive chair upright and took a seat.</p>, <p>“Phewwwwwwww.”</p>, <p>How much does this chair cost? It’s incredibly cushy.</p>, <p>The marshmallow-like cushion enveloped my hips, while the ergonomically curved backrest tenderly supported my back and waist.</p>, <p>“Ah…”</p>, <p>As I surrendered to the comfort of this large, luxurious chair, my tension naturally dissolved… and my eyes began to close…</p>, <p>“Kim Shin-hwa, what are you doing? Are you dumb?”</p>, <p>“Ah, please. I’m not as resilient as you.”</p>, <p>I casually responded and plugged the USB into the computer.</p>, <p>It served as a sort of data key…</p>, <p>Upon inserting it into the computer, the dedicated program was automatically activated.</p>, <p>The specified program window opened on the monitor, and a message appeared.</p>, <p><em>– This program can only be operated by personnel with specified security clearance.</em></p>, <p><em>– Please enter the password if you seek authorization.</em></p>, <p>The password could only be discovered by solving a certain puzzle hidden on the second floor.</p>, <p>Even though I was a stagnant water who had cleared the same game numerous times, I couldn’t possibly memorize a password meant for one-time use in such a place.</p>, <p>Moreover, the password was… M1g0’5WI+I1573I2.</p>, <p>Before acquiring such abilities in this world, it would have been a password impossible to memorize even if asked.</p>, <p>However, thanks to an intelligence stat of 30, I could recall every minor sentence and text I had seen in the game.</p>, <p>Therefore, I was able to effortlessly enter the 17-character password which was a random jumble of special characters, numbers, and letters.</p>, <p><em>– Authorization granted.</em></p>, <p>The program starts running with that robotic message.</p>, <p><em>Whirrrrr…</em></p>, <p>“What’s that?”</p>, <p>“It’s not a big deal, so don’t worry and just wait.”</p>, <p><em>Whirrrrr…</em></p>, <p>You could feel the slight feeling of floating that you often experience in an elevator, along with a slight vibration sound that echoed throughout the room.</p>, <p>Magic could unlock any door no matter how securely it was sealed.</p>, <p>However, there was no spell to operate an elevator that worked exclusively with a dedicated program.</p>, <p>This director’s office was, in and of itself, a huge elevator.</p>, <p>The only way down to the basement was through this.</p>, <p>The elevator moved at a slow pace while continuing its descent.</p>, <p>The basement was not merely the depth of a single room.</p>, <p>If it were that shallow, it would have been easier to simply break through the floor with magic rather than go through all this trouble.</p>, <p>But this elevator was currently descending nearly ten meters underground, which was too far for my detection spells to feel.</p>, <p><em>Creaaaak…</em></p>, <p>The movement of the director’s office came to a halt.</p>, <p>Now, if I were to get up and walk out the door… that would be it… that would be it… but my behind just wouldn’t lift from the seat.</p>, <p>“Ugh…”</p>, <p>I wanted to stay seated a little longer, but this was not the time.</p>, <p>Haaah… Moreover, considering what awaited me outside, this was no time to indulge in such trivial stuff.</p>, <p>In the basement awaited an event even more unsettling than anything I had seen on the third floor.</p>, <p><em>Creak…</em></p>, <p>I opened the door of the director’s office.</p>, <p>A scene completely different from the first floor of the hospital I had just seen unfolded before me.</p>, <p>The basement was dark. Lighting fixtures were installed, but knowing they wouldn’t turn on, I felt no need to tamper with them.</p>, <p>[Dancing flames]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh—</em></p>, <p>A cluster of light flickered and danced into existence from the tips of my fingers.</p>, <p>The vast expanse of the basement revealed itself.</p>, <p>The size… appeared to be roughly 300 square meters.</p>, <p>Inexplicable machinery and boxes of goods were haphazardly piled up inside.</p>, <p>Normally, they should have been neatly arranged according to standard… but it seems that Je Mu-gyeong’s condition became erratic and he caused a ruckus here.</p>, <p>Most of what met the eye here consisted of familiar equipment in the world of the game, or rather even outside it in the real world. However, I couldn’t help but notice the occasional presence of strange devices that simply couldn’t exist in our reality.</p>, <p>Special devices monopolized by large corporations operating in secret in the darkness of [Cthulhu World]. They are not the mainstream computers available to the public but are real computers crafted by stealing alien technologies.</p>, <p>Upon encountering these mysterious devices, Curtain Call remarked with a look of astonishment on her face.</p>, <p>“What are these… tacky toys?”</p>, <p>A sharp critique indeed.</p>, <p>Just because these computers were fashioned using alien technology and are ahead of their time doesn’t mean their design is futuristic and sleek. The unveiled computers and mechanical devices bore a clunky and outdated appearance, reminiscent of what one might expect in a 60s or 70s sci-fi animation.</p>, <p>With their analog dials resembling clocks, brightly colored oversized buttons, inscrutable antennas, and thick glass domes, they seemed like relics from another era.</p>, <p>Even if viewed with the utmost generosity, these designs would not have emerged post-1990s.</p>, <p>“It might seem strange, but this is the result of downgrading alien technology to a form that humans can handle.”</p>, <p>[Remarkable Achievement Unlocked!

            "[<p>But meeting the Mi-go was out of the question today.</p>, <p>At the moment when Je Mu-gyeong and his friends initiated their rebellion, the Mi-go had already escaped from this laboratory.</p>, <p>However, it was possible to encounter something else.</p>, <p><em>– Who… is…?</em></p>, <p>An eerie voice filled the air.</p>, <p>“Who’s there?!”</p>, <p>“Hold on Curtain Call.”</p>, <p><em>– Who is it…?</em></p>, <p><em>– Why… is it… so dark…?</em></p>, <p>“Kim Shin-hwa, what… is that?”</p>, <p>“That… is an assistant of the Mi-go.”</p>, <p>The assistant of the Mi-go was the sole survivor among the researchers of this hospital.</p>, <p>Though it was debatable whether this could still be considered survival.</p>, <p>I didn’t know its name. In the game, it was simply referred to as “Migo’s assistant”.</p>, <p>The assistant of the Mi-go spoke to me.</p>, <p><em>– What on earth… has happened?</em></p>, <p>“You’ve been deceived by the Mi-go.”</p>, <p><em>Bubbling… Bubbling…</em></p>, <p>There was nothing in the room that bore a human shape.</p>, <p>Only a large glass tube was placed on the desk.</p>, <p>It was a glass tube connected to a mechanical device of avant-garde design.</p>, <p>Inside the glass tube was a living human brain.</p>, <p>The very thing often joked about… a “brain in a jar”.</p>, <p>This was “Mi-go’s assistant”.</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated. The mental distortion has been nullified.]</p>, <p><em>Bubbling…</em></p>, <p>The sound of bubbling emanated from the glass tube.</p>, <p>A strangely modulated human voice flowed from the speaker connected to the machine.</p>, <p>The emotionless voice continued to pose questions to me.</p>, <p><em>– Why… can’t my body… move?</em></p>, <p><em>– Where are… the others?</em></p>, <p><em>– I want… to go home…</em></p>, <p>The Mi-go often engaged in such perverse acts for the sake of their research.</p>, <p>They would open a human’s head, extract the brain, and imprison it in what they called a “Mi-go Brain Cylinder”.</p>, <p>This wasn’t something they did to just anyone… Typically, they reserved this grotesque form of “kindness” for humans who caught their fancy.</p>, <p>This was, in a manner of speaking, a gift from the Mi-go.</p>, <p>Why consider this a gesture of goodwill or a gift?</p>, <p>Who could possibly understand?</p>, <p>With a culture and philosophy utterly alien to humanity, trying to comprehend their actions was futile.</p>, <p>If I were to enlighten this brain about its predicament, instead of driving it to madness, it would impart to me the madness and wisdom of the Cthulhu Mythos.</p>, <p>And if I coax this brain well, I may be able to find out the truth about what happened here.</p>, <p>But neither was of any real use to me. I had already experienced both paths in the game.</p>, <p>“Kim Shin-hwa, kill it!”</p>, <p>Suddenly, Curtain Call cried out.</p>, <p>“Just a moment.”</p>, <p>“Ah. Kill it now!”</p>, <p>“Wait.”</p>, <p>Instead, I turned off the life support system beneath the glass tube.</p>, <p><em>– Are you… still… nearby?</em></p>, <p><em>– Hello…? Hello…?

It leaves behind a bad taste. If you go through events that are hostile to Helistic, you will have several more opportunities to confront the Mi-go race. When those times come, perhaps there will be an opportunity to shake off this foul mood.</p>, <p>Curtain Call and I moved further into the Mi-go’s laboratory and soon discovered a special area.</p>, <p>The first thing that caught our eye was a large surgery table.</p>, <p>This was no ordinary surgery table.</p>, <p>Each part of the table was equipped with restraints for the hands, feet, and torso.</p>, <p>At the head of the table, there were ominous rotating saw blades, drills, and mechanical arms whose purpose was difficult to discern.</p>, <p>“What is this bizarre thing?”</p>, <p>“It’s a rather sophisticated surgery table where lying here, those mechanical arms would automatically move to decapitate and extract the brain.”</p>, <p>How many had been decapitated here?</p>, <p>“Is this all there is to this place? Just this horrendous stuff?”</p>, <p>“You wanted to come here, and now all you have are complaints.”</p>, <p>“I thought there would be more things to kill.”</p>, <p>What kind of remark was that?</p>, <p>“I’m bored now, so I’ll be by the elevator. Kim Shin-hwa, grab what you need and come quickly.”</p>, <p>“Hmm, alright then.”</p>, <p>There wasn’t anything here that could possibly interest Curtain Call anyway. What I needed was that book, the one that drove Je Mu-gyeong mad.</p>, <p>Je Mu-gyeong had behaved entirely differently in the game.</p>, <p>It was surely that book that had changed him.</p>, <p><em>I need to escape this world.</em></p>, <p>It wasn’t strange for me who was an outsider to this world to harbor such thoughts, but why would Je Mu-gyeong who was a being of this world come to think the same thing?</p>, <p>And then there was that final message sent telepathically by the Mi-go researcher.</p>, <p>All the secrets and clues must be connected to that grimoire.</p>, <p><em>I’ve found it</em></p>, <p>I found an old manuscript with a red cover in a bookshelf of avant-garde design nearby.</p>, <p>[The Silent Scripture of the Dreaming Path</p>, <p>Category: Grimoire</p>, <p>Author: Unknown</p>, <p>Year of Creation: 16th Century</p>, <p>Language: Tibetan</p>, <p>This book deals with the principles of life and death and the secrets of reincarnation. It concretely describes the afterlife and the realm of dreams and outlines the path to enlightenment.</p>, <p>Further research is required to ascertain the true value of the book.]</p>, <p>The message window displayed correctly.</p>, <p>Originally, pressing the [Research] button would automatically conduct the research… but now it seems I must examine it myself.</p>, <p>Given the book’s age, the paper was incredibly fragile.</p>, <p>The cover was in relatively good condition, which led me to believe that someone from a later generation might have rebound the cover.</p>, <p>I carefully opened the book while taking great care not to tear the fragile paper.</p>, <p>As I turned the pages, I noticed thin sheets riddled with holes…</p>, <p>Wait a minute? The yellow color was the paper, and the black color was the letters.</p>, <p>“But I can’t read the writing…?”</p>, <p>[The Silent Scripture of the Dreaming Path</p>, <p>Language: Tibetan]</p>, <p>No matter how intelligent one might be, it’s impossible to immediately read a language that one has never encountered before.</p>, <p>How did Je Mu-gyeong manage to read this? Did he know Tibetan?</p>, <p>I soon found the answer.</p>, <p>It was because he had discovered an artifact that granted him the ability to decipher languages.</p>, <p>However, it was an item I could not use.</p>, <p>I picked up a small flask that I found on the shelf.</p>, <p>Inside the flask was a grotesque creature the size of a thumb, wriggling with tiny cilia.</p>, <p>It had such a horrible shape that the best I could do was describe it as a creature that resembled a Grima.</p>, <p>[Language Assistance Parasite (B-rank Implant): An implant designed to facilitate fluency in various languages. It contains 78 languages currently used on Earth and 8 extraterrestrial languages.</p>, <p>A parasitic organism created using Mi-go technology. This can be directly inserted into the brain using a specialized surgical device.]</p>, <p>Despite the high efficiency of this artifact, which allows for the mastering of dozens of languages quite easily, there are side effects, such as bursts of madness or a significant reduction in humanity.</p>, <p>By placing my head on the surgical table over there, I could have this alien Grima implanted into my brain.</p>, <p>Since it wasn’t my real life, I often went ahead with such implants in the game… but, fu*k.</p>, <p>My mind was already in a precarious state as it was; I had no desire to further complicate matters by embedding a grima into my brain.</p>, <p>“Tsk, should I manually decipher Tibetan somehow?”</p>, <p>It might take some time, but with my current intelligence, it wouldn’t be too difficult a task.</p>, <p>Ultimately, I decided to set aside the immediate examination of The Silent Scripture of the Dreaming Path and shoved it into my backpack.</p>, <p>It was disappointing not to have the answers right away, but there were more things to gather here.</p>, <p>I checked a few more books gathered on the bookshelf.</p>, <p>Even though finding a research journal directly left by the Mi-go would have been incredibly helpful, no such thing existed.</p>, <p>Perhaps due to their different physiological structure from humans, they didn’t leave behind anything resembling a research journal.</p>, <p>“Yet, they somehow managed to collaborate with humans to create experimental subjects…”</p>, <p>The Mi-go was a race that was very proud when it came to their technology.</p>, <p>It was classified as taboo to teach their technology to other races, such as humans.</p>, <p>To the point where they would send assassins after anyone who dared to steal their technology.</p>, <p>But they still go and collaborate with human corporations like this…. which meant that they had a goal big enough to override their taboos.</p>, <p>While there were no direct documents from the Mi-go, it wasn’t true that there was nothing of use.</p>, <p>“Was this written by human researchers?”</p>, <p>It was a note written by someone’s hand about the test subjects… Among them, it contained information about the experiments conducted on Je Mu-gyeong.</p>, <p>The author of these notes was likely either killed by the test subjects or had their brains harvested by the Mi-go.</p>, <p>Although not of the caliber of magical books, these documents still held value in the context of the game.</p>, <p>I tossed those experimental notes into the cart and turned my attention to the other books.</p>, <p>Most of the other books revolved around biological knowledge or human modification.</p>, <p>Being involved with Helistic kept leading me to accumulate such materials.</p>, <p>Combining these materials with the [Secret Knowledge: Creation of Life] trait I acquired last time could lead to incredible achievements.</p>, <p>The knowledge of creating life was a trait I had never acquired throughout my journey in [Cthulhu World], making it difficult to decide how to make use of it.</p>, <p>I made sure to collect all the books that seemed useful.</p>, <p><em>Ah, there is one more thing I need to grab.</em></p>, <p>Aren’t there gamers who can’t rest until they’ve rubbed against every wall and opened every box in sight? I’m one of those gamers. It’s a time-consuming habit, but it’s the only way to uncover certain information.</p>, <p><em>It was around here somewhere…</em></p>, <p>I slid my hand into a small nook hidden among ordinary-looking mechanical devices….and pulled…</p>, <p><em>Click.</em></p>, <p><em>Right.</em></p>, <p>There was a very small secret box here. It was more akin to a secret shelf, but I reached inside and pulled out a small stone hidden within.</p>, <p>It was a smooth shiny stone about 5cm in diameter.</p>, <p>On one side, a star-shaped magic circle was engraved into the middle of the object amidst the emerald glow. It felt more like an artifact of magic than a product of technology.</p>, <p>[Guardian Amulet of the Ancient God (B-rank Magical Tool): a protective amulet with the power to drive away malevolent forces and weaken beings from the abyss. Blessed with the protection of an ancient deity.]</p>, <p>Despite the grand description of its power to weaken abyssal beings, the effect of this Guardian series varied significantly by rank. Since it was B-rank, it was more likely to fend off minions of the abyss rather than directly influence the beings themselves.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, it could still be harmful to the Mi-go.</p>, <p>However, it seemed the Mi-go had humans insert this amulet into a device to extract the ancient deity’s energy contained within.</p>, <p>As a result, its magical power was depleted, rendering it unable to perform at its full capacity.</p>, <p>“Still, it’s a thousand times better than having nothing at all.”</p>, <p>If all else fails, it could serve as a material or a catalyst for other artifacts.</p>, <p>I packed up the items I had gathered and headed toward the elevator.</p>, <p>“It’s time to head back.”</p>, <p>As I approached the elevator, I saw Curtain Call leaning against the wall. Her gaze was fixed on something… The brain container of the Mi-go assistant who had died earlier.</p>, <p><em>That’s quite an indescribable scene in its own right.</em></p>, <p>I wondered what she was thinking.</p>, <p>“Curtain Call, it’s time to go back.”</p>, <p>“I’ve killed a lot, Kim Shin-hwa.”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>“I think I’ve killed about 50 people. Right?”</p>, <p>There were 58 subjects here, including Je Mu-gyeong. Considering the ones I subdued, it’s possible that the number of subjects Curtain Call ended could be around that.</p>, <p>“What are you trying to say?”</p>, <p>“We need to kill more… only then can I fulfill my wish.”</p>, <p>A wish? What kind of psychopath talk is that?</p>, <p>It reminded me of my recent encounter with Jang Hyeon-deok and the [King in Yellow]. They had mentioned a wish. In [Cthulhu World], the mention of “wishes” seldom bodes well.</p>, <p>It implies something is broken, someone will die, or something will become twisted—if it hasn’t already. It is a word that is only mentioned in such situations.</p>, <p>I moved closer to Curtain Call and spoke.</p>, <p>“What kind of wish do you want to fulfill?”</p>, <p>“Well? That’s not what’s important. The fact that it’s being fulfilled is.”</p>, <p>“Curtain Call, I’m not quite sure what you’re getting at…”</p>, <p>“Did Kim Shin-hwa kill for no particular reason?”</p>, <p>“No, there was a reason.”</p>, <p>Or perhaps there was no reason not to kill.</p>, <p>“Can’t you hear the voices?”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>“The revelation that commands us to kill. You think people are killed without such a thing?”</p>, <p>“Who… says such things?”</p>, <p>Curtain Call looked at me with wide eyes and smiled.</p>, <p>“The [All-Mother].”</p>, <p>“Ah.”</p>, <p>That one was a familiar name.</p>, <p>This was the nickname of [The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young], the abyssal being that turned Lee Chang-hyuk into a mutant.</p>, <p>The monstrous power and bizarre madness of Curtain Call, a surreal force that can only be called a mutation. I understood where it all came from. Curtain Call was a cultist who received the blessing of the [The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young].</p>, <p>A dangerous and horrifying cultist who praises the great goddess by repeating slaughters in accordance with her revelations.</p>, <p>However, for some reason, it seemed that the blade was only directed at entities associated with the corporation named Helistic.</p>, <p>For the time being…. I decided to keep a closer watch on her… And that day I parted ways with Curtain Call without further conversation.</p>]\n",

Yet there were no places where such artifacts could be found for that purpose in the vicinity of Paju.</p>, <p>“If I wanted to find something with a similar effect, I’d have to go at least as far as Gangwon Province…”</p>, <p>Considering the small size of the Korean Peninsula, any destination could be reached within a day. However, apart from the physical distance, the psychological distance was quite far, and the idea of leaving my cramped and vulnerable studio apartment to travel such a distance was unsettling.</p>, <p><em>I fear some unexpected and bizarre quest might appear while I’m away…</em></p>, <p>Thus, the plan for a long journey was postponed until the security of my base could be firmly established.</p>, <p>“Tch, does that mean I’m utterly at the mercy of the nightmares sent by those abyssal beings…”</p>, <p>No, when I think about it, there is no reason to insist on finding an artifact that is already complete.</p>, <p>Last time, I had a rough time after meeting the [King in Yellow] in Tanhyeon, but as a result, a new ability was added to Carcosa’s mask.</p>, <p>[Madman’s Dexterity: You can unlock the hidden abilities of an artifact or attempt modifications to bestow other powers.

Failure in the check will result in a random mental illness afflicting your mind.]</p>, <p>Originally, it was a rare trait that only alchemists, technomancers, or craftsmen classes could possess.</p>, <p>Of course, it wasn’t possible for me to just insert any ability I desired into any artifact, but enhancing the power of something with a similar effect was certainly worth a try.</p>, <p>Beyond merely warding off nightmares, a few artifacts and abilities came to mind that could prove useful. With some luck, I might even be able to create an artifact that could improve health or strength.</p>, <p>“Indeed. I should have thought of this sooner.”</p>, <p>Alright, I’ve made up my mind. Today, I need to go out, even if it’s a bit of a stretch.</p>, <p>When I tried to get up, I heard a creaking and cracking sound coming from my body.</p>, <p>“Ugh… Lying down and resting isn’t always the best approach…”</p>, <p>While I’m out, it might be a good idea to drop by Vasilisa to check on the latest news of Helistic and, if I’m lucky, to check out Curtain Call.</p>, <p>“Ah, but first, I need to eat something.”</p>, <p>I carefully navigated through the room cluttered with various items, artifacts, and treasures scattered around like trash and made my way to the cramped kitchen.</p>, <p>When I opened the refrigerator, I was greeted by biological tissue samples from the laboratory and flesh samples that were a by-product of life creation magic nestled among the chilled groceries.</p>, <p>Jars floated with bizarrely shaped pieces of flesh. Some were adorned with dozens of eyeballs, others sprouted unpleasant hair, and some formed organs resembling fingers larger than their own bodies. To the average person, this sight could induce not just a loss of appetite but outright distress. However, it had no effect whatsoever on my psyche.</p>, <p>Among the flesh samples, I found a half-eaten head of cabbage, a split carrot, and some sausages.</p>, <p>“I guess I could whip up a sausage and vegetable stir-fry.”</p>, <p>I cooked and then ate my meal in the cramped confines of my home where only the bare minimum space for survival remained.</p>, <p>After finishing my meal and stepping outside, I noticed the sun was already setting.</p>, <p>It had been over two months since I last saw the sun properly.</p>, <p>Isn’t it said that a lack of sunlight can lead to health issues?</p>, <p>Originally, I had started wandering the streets at night because wearing a mask during the day was troublesome.</p>, <p><em>But that problem has already been resolved.</em></p>, <p>By using second-order magic, I could either overlay an illusion on my mask or completely hide my presence before moving around.</p>, <p>Despite this, I still found myself moving through the darkness and hiding in the guise of this bizarrely shaped mask.</p>, <p>Now, I might use the excuse of a reversed sleep pattern, but that’s not the real reason. I had an inexplicable aversion to overlaying illusions on my mask.</p>, <p><em>It seems like my mask obsession is unconsciously applying a psychological brake here…</em></p>, <p>Because it was a feeling of aversion that was difficult to explain properly, it wasn’t easy to think of a way to fix it. Likely, I’ll continue this way until the current situation leads to a bigger problem.</p>, <p>While I was lost in these thoughts, I eventually arrived at Vasilisa.</p>, <p>Vasilisa remained a place where the extraordinary unfolded in the usual ways.</p>, <p>The sight of rugged mercenaries and scarred muscled fixers sitting face-to-face, sipping on iced Americanos and caramel macchiatos, was enough to make one’s head spin.</p>, <p><em>Do these guys have nothing better to do than lounge here all day while sipping their coffees?</em></p>, <p>And at Vasilisa’s counter, a peculiar barista with a large monitor for a head was polishing cups. Today, Curtain Call was also seated nearby.</p>, <p>This place was neither a pub nor a traditional bar. Yet, Curtain Call seemed to naturally take a seat in front of the counter while chatting away with Orb as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>, <p>“Hey, Curtain Call.”</p>, <p>“Ah, Kim Shin-hwa has arrived? Hey Orb, did you know I went to Gamaksan with Kim Shin-hwa last time?”</p>, <p>Curtain Call’s gaze lingered on me for about a second, perhaps? After a brief acknowledgment that hardly qualified as a greeting, her attention shifted back to Orb. It seemed futile to try and engage in conversation this way.</p>, <p>As I pondered whether to attempt another approach or wait for a better opportunity, Tudor, who had been chatting with a customer further inside, gestured for me to come over.</p>, <p><em>That’s right, I didn’t come here for Curtain Call today.</em></p>, <p>I sighed and left Curtain Call who was preoccupied with Orb behind before I walked over to Tudor.</p>, <p>“I was just talking about you; good timing.”</p>, <p>“About me?”</p>, <p>Tudor flashed a sly smile and nodded towards the person sitting next to her.</p>, <p>“Ah, so you’re the new face mage that Tudor has been boasting about lately?”</p>, <p><em>A gangster…?</em></p>, <p>The thought “Is he a gangster?” came to mind. And not without reason. Given this middle-aged man’s rough-and-tumble appearance.</p>, <p>His shirt was provocatively unbuttoned at the top with four buttons undone and the elaborate tattoos peeking through the fabric.</p>, <p>Outdated large sunglasses, a beard covering his chin, and a scar around his mouth.</p>, <p>He was a familiar face. Like most people I had recently met, he was a character from the game [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>“I wanted to see the person who had neatly taken care of what our guys couldn’t handle. Fortunately, I got the chance. My name is Ko Gyeong-soo, from W.G.S.”</p>, <p>Go Kyung-soo maintained his swaggering demeanor as he handed me his business card.</p>, <p>This old-fashioned card bore his name and the company’s name in gold lettering.</p>, <p>W.G.S.</p>, <p>Wild Guns Security.</p>, <p>On the outside, it was a private security firm offering security and bodyguard services.</p>, <p>But in reality, it was a mercenary group called Wild Guns and a private military company (PMC) that specialized in deploying firepower and suppressing bases. Not that it did anything particularly remarkable. It was more like an expanded version of the typical muscle-for-hire you’d find in the real world.</p>, <p>And Ko Gyeong-sop nicknamed Wild Dog.</p>, <p>He was the leader of these thugs-for-hire.</p>, <p>I informed Ko Gyeong-soo with an indifferent expression on my face.</p>, <p>“I don’t really have a business card or anything like that.”</p>, <p>“Kuhuhu… Well, it doesn’t matter. If I need to contact you, I can always go through Tudor. Do you have any idea how much this lady has been boasting in the industry thanks to you?”</p>, <p>“I’m aware she’s been quite diligent.”</p>, <p>“If you ever crave the real thrill that Vasilisa can’t provide, feel free to reach out. We could use someone like you, coug—”</p>, <p>Tudor abruptly jabbed Ko Gyeong-soo’s thigh with the menu.</p>, <p>“Oh dear, Mr. Ko Gyeong-soo, were you about to say it’s time to head home?”</p>, <p>“No, this woman… If exchanging business cards is off-limits, why bother boasting then?”</p>, <p>“That’s jealousy for you. I allowed the exchange of business cards, but I won’t tolerate any further flirting.”</p>, <p>Ko Gyeong-soo was an NPC performing a role similar to Tudor’s.</p>, <p>While the broker Park Kwang-lim I met previously wasn’t worth considering, Ko Gyeong-soo was a different case.</p>, <p>He was an NPC worth contemplating a deal with, depending on the situation.</p>, <p>He was as trustworthy as Tudor and there were quite a few quests that could only be accessed by dealing with him.</p>, <p>If you signed a contract with him, you would be provided with basic weapons and could exclusively engage in more direct combat missions. It was less about being a fixer and more about becoming a mercenary.</p>, <p>The difference with Tudor was that he also led a military organization and was actively involved in its operations. This allowed for a different kind of interaction than with Tudor.</p>, <p>They might find themselves competing for the same target or even engaging in direct combat as enemies.</p>, <p>His team was large, indiscriminate, and willing to dabble in any affair that could be settled with guns and explosives.</p>, <p>If one chooses not to deal with him, they might end up facing him as a competitor or enemy.</p>, <p><em>I’ve killed Ko Gyeong-soo in the game… was it three times? No, four times before.</em></p>, <p>What would happen this time?</p>, <p>Ko Gyeong-soo tossed the ice cubes from his glass into his mouth and crunched them noisily.</p>, <p>“Have you received any messages from Cure?”</p>, <p>What was this sudden, out-of-the-blue remark about?</p>, <p>“Cure?”</p>, <p>“It seems you haven’t received any communication from them yet? I’m talking about Cure Biotech. Hmm… it’s the rival company of Helistic.”</p>, <p>“No, I’m aware of that. But what does Cure have to do with me?”</p>, <p>Ko Gyeong-soo hummed thoughtfully and scratched his beard for a moment before continuing.</p>, <p>“Cure mentioned something about a basement.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>There was nothing special about the abandoned hospital or the Ga-5060 secret research facility.</p>, <p>Of course, one might argue that evidence of human experimentation and artificial dimensional species was significant, but these paled in comparison to what was hidden in the basement.</p>, <p>While other artifacts could somehow be restored and replicated by other corporations, the items in the basement were one of a kind.</p>, <p>Although there were double or triple layers of security, honestly, the fact that the task of recapturing such a place was entrusted to an external fixer was enough to make one suspect that there was some kind of conspiracy.</p>, <p>Therefore, it was understandable that questions about the basement would be posed to me and to Ko Gyeong-soo of the Wild Guns, who had somehow gained access to the secret research facility.</p>, <p><em>But why is Cure, not Helistic, asking these questions?</em></p>, <p>Cure Biotech is a multinational bio company that is conducting research similar to Helistic. In terms of scale, Cure Biotech is larger.</p>, <p>Cure Biotech was the pioneer in the first place. But Helistic, which adopted the technology of extraterrestrial beings, grew at an incredible rate, and even though it was a latecomer, it became so large that it could easily contend with Cure Biotech.</p>, <p>In the game, Helistic generally played a much more significant role than Cure. The depiction of Cure in the game was mediocre at best. There were hardly any notable NPCs associated with Cure, and the quests related to them were nothing special.</p>, <p>“I just cleared out what I could see and left. I didn’t come across any basement.”</p>, <p>There was no need to discuss the basement with Ko Gyeong-soo.</p>, <p>“Well, what does it matter? Sometimes, when those who have no stake in the matter start snooping around, unexpected and dangerous situations can arise… Take care of yourself.”</p>, <p>“I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>, <p>Ko Gyeong-soo briefly lifted his glass, only to set it down with a hint of disappointment upon realizing it was empty.</p>, <p>“Well, now that I’ve seen all there is to see, I should be on my way.”</p>, <p>He rose from his seat with a grunt.</p>, <p>The gold watch on Ko Gyeong-soo’s wrist made a loud clanging sound as it collided with the gold bracelets.</p>, <p>“And mage friend. You said your name was Kim Shin-hwa, right? Keep my business card safe and give me a call whenever you think of it… Whether it’s just to share a man-to-man bond or if you’re passing by our office and feeling hungry, perhaps for a meal…”</p>, <p>Ko Gyeong-soo attempted to make his offer once more but changed his tune upon hearing Tudor’s growling.</p>, <p>Then he left the cafe, saying something along the lines of, “If I stay here any longer, the Tudors will beat me to death.”</p>, <p>“It was merely a business partnership visit.”</p>, <p>Tudor clarified the reason behind Ko Gyeong-soo’s visit.</p>, <p>“Despite his abrupt departure and manner of speaking, he was essentially saying they’re short-staffed and could use a mage’s help when the situation arises.”</p>, <p>“I see.”</p>, <p>Though it might seem off from Tudor’s explanation, this was precisely why I chose Tudor over Ko Gyeong-soo.</p>, <p>Tudor had extensive connections with other brokers, not just in Paju but in other cities as well, where her influence was significant.</p>, <p>While not frequent, opportunities to take on unique quests from other brokers through Tudor did present themselves.</p>, <p>The terms and fees might differ from dealing directly with the brokers, but such differences were manageable.</p>, <p>“Well, whether Ko Gyeong-soo asks or not, if it’s not the right fit for you, I’ll block it on my end.”</p>, <p>Tudor assured me and led me to her office.</p>, <p>As soon as I sat down in the office, I posed a question to Tudor.</p>, <p>“Did Helistic give you any trouble?”</p>, <p>In reality, since the money could be transferred directly to my account, there was no actual need to visit Vasilisa.</p>, <p>The reason for my visit to Vasilisa today was out of curiosity about how Helistic’s aftermath was handled.</p>, <p>“Indeed, there was a bit of a fuss with Helistic coming around while you were away.”</p>, <p>“Was there any particular issue?”</p>, <p>“There were a few inquiries, but I managed to settle most of them on my own. A lot of the responses I gave were made on your behalf, though…”</p>, <p>“On my behalf?”</p>, <p>“Well, I gave you a smartphone, but you never picked it up!”</p>, <p>Tudor raised her voice for a moment, not in anger but with a playful tone.</p>, <p>“What to do? We just conducted a virtual interview with our Mr. Kim Shin-hwa. But Helistic was satisfied after all so the reality doesn’t matter.”</p>, <p>“There was a reason I couldn’t respond.”</p>, <p>I had simply been sleeping, but there was no need to say that.</p>, <p>“Hmm, well, whatever.”</p>, <p>Tudor said this as she pulled out a file folder.</p>, <p>“If you’re curious about what I answered to Helistic’s questions, take a look at this.”</p>, <p>The file folder in Tudor’s hand floated up and flew towards me.</p>, <p>It seemed she had prepared this in advance, anticipating that I might ask such a question.</p>, <p>“Thank you.”</p>, <p>“Don’t mention it.”</p>, <p>Pleased with my sincere gratitude, Tudor responded with a very elegant smile.</p>, <p>Occasionally, Tudor would flash such a stunning expression that it left me speechless.</p>, <p>Perhaps some of the guests at Vasilisa frequented the café day in and day out just to catch a glimpse of that smile, even if just once.</p>, <p>As I looked through the documents, I realized that there was no mention of the basement in Helistic.</p>, <p><em>It’s a highly secure matter.</em></p>, <p>If you want to keep something secret, it’s best not to talk about it at all.</p>, <p>Instead, what caught my eye was the repeated mention of the computer in the director’s office of the research lab.</p>, <p>“It seems like it was treated as a solo mission?”</p>, <p>The records were documented as if Kim Shin-hwa, that is me, had responded and not Tudor.</p>, <p>The emphasis she placed on “on my behalf” earlier must have meant something along these lines.</p>, <p>Thanks to this, Helistic could be under the impression that I am exceptionally polite, kind, and efficient in handling affairs.</p>, <p>“In reality, the content was based on what I heard from Collie.”</p>, <p>“But why use my name instead of Curtain Call?”</p>, <p>“Oh? Is that a problem?”</p>, <p>“Not really. Just curious.”</p>, <p>“Didn’t I tell you I’d be leveraging your name for business? You need to become more famous.”</p>, <p>“Since I’ve left the method to you, I can’t really complain.”</p>, <p>“Moreover, Collie has a somewhat ambiguous relationship with Helistic… actually, it’s at the level of being blacklisted. We’ve been accepting requests from Helistic under an alias.”</p>, <p>“If it weren’t for me, Curtain Call wouldn’t have been involved in this at all.”</p>, <p>“Hehe, that’s right. But I think you satisfied your curiosity.”</p>, <p>Was this a win-win situation? If one were to twist the perspective, it could be said that Tudor had been played. Nevertheless, Tudor spoke plainly. She wasn’t saying it was all fine, but she had no complaints. After all, it was a relationship where both parties used each other to a reasonable extent. As long as no lines were crossed, she had no intention of making it an issue.</p>, <p>“Right. I guess there’s nothing more to say about this.”</p>, <p>And it seemed there was no need to read the documents any further.</p>, <p>Even if I had responded to those inquiries myself, I would have likely replied with some fabricated truth, so having someone else handle it was indeed a relief.</p>, <p>In fact, what had been documented was much more sophisticated and perfect than what I had in mind.</p>, <p>“What’s this about ‘Cure’?”</p>, <p>“It’s exactly what Ko Gyeong-soo mentioned. They didn’t say it outright, but they were curious if there were any basements or secret rooms in the abandoned hospital.”</p>, <p>“Was the basement ever public information?”</p>, <p>If there were rumors going around that there was a basement there contrary to Helistic’s belief, that would be understandable.</p>, <p>“No. ‘Cure’ was the first to mention the basement.”</p>, <p>Tudor’s expression became contemplative for a moment before he continued.</p>, <p>“Lately, ‘Cure’ has been unusually quick on the uptake. It seems they might have secured some sharp source of information, doesn’t it?”</p>, <p>A source of information… There was nothing of the sort in the game. Could this be another deviation from the game’s original storyline?</p>, <p>“It’s even more puzzling that Ko Gyeong-soo was asked such a question.”</p>, <p>“Puzzling?”</p>, <p>“Yes. The Wild Guns had no survivors, remember? It doesn’t make sense for them to ask questions that only someone in the know could answer unless they’re fools, which they are not.”</p>, <p>“Maybe they’re not curious about the basement itself… Perhaps they want to spread the rumor that they know something about it?”</p>, <p>Tudor nodded her head in agreement.</p>, <p>“That’s what I believe.”</p>, <p>Contained within were mechanical devices and grimoires that modern technology couldn’t replicate.</p>, <p>Moreover, Helistic’s researchers had conducted experiments using the bodily fluids from the [Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young] which induced madness and created dimensional species with the power to traverse between dimensions.</p>, <p>Which could it be? Was “Cure” interested in the super-scientific devices, the Black Goat, human modification, dimensional species, or the grimoires?</p>, <p>One might typically assume that as a competitor, Cure would be most interested in the information on human modification that Helistic had pioneered…</p>, <p><em>But… that seems too simplistic an approach.</em></p>, <p>It appeared that the need to decipher the contents of the grimoire had just increased.</p>, <p>“Now, I have nothing more to convey. I might have ended up passing on Wild Guns’ wink on their behalf had you arrived later… but thankfully, that wasn’t necessary.”</p>, <p>“Are you close with Ko Gyeong-soo?”</p>, <p>Tudor let out an exasperated sound. They seemed to be quite close.</p>, <p>Such personal relationships were not something one could ascertain in the game, making this revelation rather interesting.</p>, <p>“I helped him get settled when he was younger. Ko Gyeong-soo was a diligent child, eager to please, so I took a liking to him. But even after he became independent, he kept hovering around, which was quite bothersome.”</p>, <p>I knew she was quite old because she was a witch, but it felt slightly strange to hear her talk this way with her young appearance.</p>, <p>Ko Gyeong-soo was in his early forties. If Tudor had been helping him since he was a child, just how old could she be?</p>, <p>“I see.”</p>, <p>“Now, let’s move on to the matter of settling accounts, shall we? As previously discussed, the total comes to 120 million. Curtain Call took 50 million, leaving 70 million. Any objections?”</p>, <p>“No objections to the 70 million.”</p>, <p>“Shall I transfer it to your account as usual?”</p>, <p>“Mhmm.”</p>, <p>The balance in my account totaled 180 million.</p>, <p>With this, my savings reached 250 million, and if I included the cash piled up in my room, it would roughly amount to 300 million.</p>, <p><em>I’ve never earned this much in my original world…</em></p>, <p>“Keep in mind that I stopped Helistic from trying to lower the price.”</p>, <p>“Was there such a story?”</p>, <p>“It’s always like that when it comes to corporate requests. But you’re all set if you just trust me. It’s not for nothing that I’m called a capable broker.”</p>, <p>I casually acknowledged Tudor’s self-praise.</p>, <p>“Right. I’ll be counting on you in the future as well.”</p>, <p>“Good. Speaking of which, how’s your condition? I’m hoping you can start taking on work again soon.”</p>, <p>“How soon are we talking?”</p>, <p>“Hehe… could you start right away if I said ‘immediately’?”</p>, <p>“You don’t seem to be in such a hurry to say that.”</p>, <p>“Ah, you’re quick to catch on.”</p>, <p>“If it were urgent, you wouldn’t be wasting time with Ko Gyeong-soo.”</p>, <p>“Well, that’s true. Here, take a look at this, my dear. These are all tasks with some leeway in their schedules, so feel free to choose at your leisure.”</p>, <p>Tudor slowly pulled out a thin file and extended it towards me after making her statement.</p>, <p>When I glanced at the file, I saw a concise summary of the quests listed one by one on one or two pages. The organized documents in the file seemed to total around 100 pages. Even if we estimate generously that there was one quest every two pages, that still amounted to 50 quests.</p>, <p>“The content seems quite substantial, doesn’t it?”</p>, <p>“This only goes to show that there are many tasks out there that cannot be resolved unless by a mage of your caliber.”</p>, <p>“Hmm.”</p>, <p>At a glance, none of the requests appeared to be simple.</p>, <p>These were requests that had accumulated over days and months and remained unresolved. Just like the last time we visited the abandoned hospital on Gamaksan, there were consecutive instances where other fixers or mercenary groups had rushed in and been completely wiped out.</p>, <p>“It seems they are all challenging tasks.”</p>, <p>“Of course, the compensation for such requests is substantial. The page you’re looking at right now, for instance, guarantees over a billion if you can settle it cleanly.”</p>, <p>“That sounds interesting.”</p>, <p>“Umm…”</p>, <p>Suddenly, Tudor emitted a noise resembling a groan and hesitated before speaking.</p>, <p>“My dear, perhaps it’s time we got a bit more honest with each other, don’t you think?”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Tudor was still smiling, but the emotion hidden behind that face was quite complicated. It seemed slightly tinged with anger, yet it was different. It was certainly the most serious expression Tudor had shown in recent times.</p>, <p>“What is it?”</p>, <p>“Ever since before the last request of Gamaksan, both your reputation and expectations have been on the rise. Yet, you still seem so indifferent, which makes it difficult for a broker like me.”</p>, <p>Then she waved her hands dismissively with an exaggerated gesture.</p>, <p>“Ah… it’s tough. It seems that even raising the financial stakes isn’t enough to entice you.”</p>, <p>“I’ve never complained about the compensation though.”</p>, <p>Tudor narrowed her eyes and shook her head.</p>, <p>“I like you. You’re reliable, and I expect that you can achieve even greater things than what you’ve shown so far.”</p>, <p>“But?”</p>, <p>“But it doesn’t seem like you’re very satisfied with the work. Even if you take the money reluctantly this time, if we can’t guarantee something better next time, it’ll just lead to mutual frustration.”</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>“What do you think? I’d prefer if you had a wish I could fulfill, or at the very least, a desire I could understand. But even if not, I think it’s time you showed a bit of what’s on your mind.”</p>, <p>“A wish…”</p>, <p>It reminds me of what the shadow created by the [King in Yellow] had said last time. Of course, that doesn’t mean Tudor is attempting that kind of temptation with me now.</p>, <p>It’s simply a suggestion to make the terms of our deal more concrete.</p>, <p>It was then I realized what this scene was about.</p>, <p>Though it was depicted differently in the game, it seems my relationship with Tudor has progressed to level 2.</p>, <p>After this event, the range of services available to me will expand.</p>, <p>“As I’ve said before, it’s always good to have more money.”</p>, <p>“And?”</p>, <p>Yes, that’s a valid point. Money is good. In the short term, what I desire is safety, a few conveniences, and the financial means to acquire a limited amount of resources.</p>, <p>However, having already secured the money necessary for immediate needs, what comes next? What lies beyond is something that money can’t solve.</p>, <p>But converting a dialogue that in the game progresses naturally with the click of a button into carefully chosen words is no easy task.</p>, <p>“I want something that’s harder to obtain with money than money itself.”</p>, <p>“Such as?”</p>, <p>After thinking for a moment, I decided to be direct. Going around in circles would only lead to the mutual frustration Tudor mentioned.</p>, <p>“Now that I have money, I’m interested in a grimoire of at least A-rank difficulty or even an artifact of S-rank or higher.”</p>, <p>I wasn’t sure if Tudor was surprised but her eyes widened.</p>, <p>“Do you need magical knowledge? But with your skills and talents, you could undergo formal training under a proper mage or attend a magical institution in another region… Why involve yourself in these messy affairs in Paju?”</p>, <p>“I’m not interested in modernized magic theories. I need something more primal.”</p>, <p>Tudor’s words began veering off in an unexpected direction, so I interrupted her.</p>, <p>“Something primal?”</p>, <p>“Abyssal beings, demons, great old beings, outer gods, or rulers from different worlds. I’m seeking information related to beings known by such names.”</p>, <p>“Ah, so you need something in the form of a grimoire or an artifact that’s associated with such beings? Yes, indeed, those aren’t things one can simply acquire with money alone.”</p>, <p>Ordinary grimoires containing conventional magical theories or artifacts of less than A-rank could be purchased with money.</p>, <p>However, what I needed went beyond that.</p>, <p>S-rank artifacts or grimoires containing information about abyssal beings couldn’t be obtained through ordinary means.</p>, <p>Without the right connections, power, and various other factors, acquiring them was impossible, and many of them could bring significant harm to their owners just by being in their possession.</p>, <p>In other words, if the client was just a nouveau riche with nothing but money to show, I wouldn’t want to fulfill this request even if I could.</p>, <p>“The grimoire I’m referring to is of that nature. Or, you could introduce me to someone who can take me to the black market or something deeper.”</p>, <p>When the conversation reached this point, Tudor’s smile brightened up. It was clear she wasn’t hiding her joy.</p>, <p>“Good, good. If you had mentioned this earlier, I could have been more proactive in helping you.”</p>, <p>“Well, there wasn’t a particularly notable situation to speak of.”</p>, <p>This development was likely an event that emerged due to an increase in Tudor’s trust and intimacy levels.</p>, <p>Although I couldn’t be certain, mentioning this earlier would probably have been in vain. That capricious witch might have intentionally arranged a request that had nothing to do with my wishes or completely forgotten about them.</p>, <p>However, at this moment she seemed happy, if nothing else. From the next task onward, I could anticipate rewards beyond mere financial gain.</p>, <p>“So, it seems there’s nothing immediate for you to introduce to me. Still, take this file with you.”</p>, <p>“I’ll give it a read.”</p>, <p>“Do that. And if anything catches your eye, let me know. Besides, you wouldn’t want to find yourself short on funds if you gained access to the market later, would you?”</p>, <p>“That’s also true.”</p>, <p>With that, my conversation with Tudor concluded.</p>, <p>When I was about to leave Vasilisa, Tudor followed me to the entrance, making small talk all the while.</p>, <p>It was rare for Tudor to personally see someone off, which seemed to stir a subtle sense of jealousy among the regulars lounging around the cafe.</p>, <p>“I’ll contact you as soon as I find something that fits the bill, so make sure to answer your phone this time. And don’t get distracted by other brokers in the meantime, alright?”</p>, <p>Tudor repeated her warning not to get sidetracked several times as if something was bothering her.</p>, <p>Was she worried because she could see the business cards of other brokers trickling in, or was it perhaps her witch’s intuition hinting at some impending crisis?</p>, <p><em>No, that’s just foolish speculation.</em></p>, <p>If there was truly something amiss, she would have mentioned it, given her straightforward nature.</p>, <p>“Well, I have no plans to deal with anyone else for the time being… so I’ll come right over when you call.”</p>, <p>When I completely left Vasilisa and looked around, the sun had completely set and it was dark.</p>, <p>The dilapidated and gloomy buildings around added a chilling atmosphere.</p>, <p>“Alright, it’s time to address the real purpose of my outing today.”</p>, <p>I slowly made my way toward the Geumchon Market. I trusted Tudor to find the request I wanted without needing further explanation. It might take some time, but it was a move I would have to make anyway. There was no harm in preparing in advance.</p>, <p>My destination for the moving preparations was Geumchon Market.</p>, <p>The sun had already set, and it was time for the streetlights to illuminate the surroundings.</p>, <p>The key places in Geumchon Market, like the street vendors and market alleys, had closed for the day and the proprietors had gone home. Even if I had arrived earlier, my visit to this neighborhood wasn’t for the shops that cater to Paju’s daytime needs.</p>, <p>I headed towards the Geumchon Pawnshop located on one side of Geumchon Market.</p>, <p>As I climbed up the old and creaky stairs of Geumchon Pawnshop, a pawn shop filled with all sorts of items from various eras revealed itself.</p>, <p>And Jeong Ye-eun who was the pawnshop’s sole part-timer greeted me with a strange noise.</p>, <p>“Hic! How can I help you?”</p>, <p>She was still wearing her dark green school gym clothes with an apron from the “Geumchon Traditional Market Prosperity Association”.</p>, <p>I thought she might have been fired last time… But seeing her holding a duster, it seems she’s still managing to work here.</p>, <p>“Are you still working here?”</p>, <p>“Oh, yes. You’re still wearing a mask, I see. Oh! That’s the mask you bought from our shop last time, isn’t it?”</p>, <p>Jeong Ye-eun animatedly pointed at my mask as she spoke.</p>, <p>“Well, yes. How about the old man?”</p>, <p>“He’s inside. Grandpa!”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek, an old man with a hunched posture, walked out from inside the pawn shop.</p>, <p>His face was lined with wrinkles, but there was a certain drive in his firm expression.</p>, <p>“What’s it? Ah… the masked one, you’re back again?”</p>, <p>“Yes. Like last time, I have some things I want to get rid of, and some things I need.”</p>, <p>I took out four magic stones from my bag and placed them on the counter.</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek’s eyes widened.</p>, <p>These were items extracted from the golden dancers guarding that strange historical site in Tanhyeon.</p>, <p>The purity was remarkable, with not a single impurity marring their clear luster and their size was considerable.</p>, <p>Magic stones of this level were difficult to come by even in Paju.</p>, <p>“What’s this…? Where did you pick up something of such high purity? Did you cross the Imjin River when I wasn’t looking?”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek grumbled as he fumbled for his glasses.</p>, <p>It was the same peculiar pair I had seen before with several small lenses attached to them.</p>, <p>Taking one of the magic stones in hand, Jeong Eun-taek switched the lenses of his glasses to examine it closely.</p>, <p>“Oh sh*t… it’s genuine. Did you bring this here intending to take all the cash in the shop?”</p>, <p>“Grandpa, but why cross the Imjin River? Monsters appear in Paju too, don’t they? Haven’t you heard about the werewolf sighting in Gwangtan? It’s been only about two months!”</p>, <p>Jeong Ye-eun subtly joined the conversation.</p>, <p>If they were referring to the werewolf sighted in Gwangtan two months ago… could it possibly be about Lee Chang-hyuk? It seems like the details have been somewhat distorted.</p>, <p>“No, whether it’s a werewolf or whatever, there are no monsters in Paju that could produce magic stones of this caliber.”</p>, <p>“Ah…”</p>, <p>“It’s not like it’s a gold rush. Fixers and monster hunters have been invading and turning Paju upside down for over 20 years now. What do you think is left?”</p>, <p>It was a valid point. Based on the setting of [Cthulhu World], there was a tremendous event known as the [Great Collapse] that happened around 20 years ago, during which monsters from the Cthulhu mythos massively emerged in various parts of the world.</p>, <p>At that time, the place that ironically saw the most monstrous influx in Korea, specifically on the Korean Peninsula, was North Korean territory. Of course, other parts of Korea also witnessed the appearance of cultists following the abyssal entities, monsters, surreal beings, and aliens, but compared to North Korea, which had practically vanished, it was almost laughable.</p>, <p>The situation was so severe that Gangwon Province and the northern part of Gyeonggi were on the verge of devastation due to the monsters crossing the demilitarized zone and moving southward.</p>, <p>But that’s somewhat of an old story now. In the game timeline of [Cthulhu World], most issues have been resolved by now. Today’s Paju is suffering from too many treasure hunters, fixers, and criminal organizations relative to the reduced number of monsters.</p>, <p><em>Well, if we follow the game’s storyline, this is just a temporary lull before the main story leads to a second Great Collapse and the onset of doom.</em></p>, <p>And in none of the endings I experienced was there a route where this world was safely protected, and all the monsters were driven away.</p>, <p>In the meantime, Jeong Ye-eun briefly wore a thoughtful expression on her face before she suddenly exclaimed.</p>, <p>“Ah!”</p>, <p>It seemed she had arrived at the conclusion her grandfather was leading her towards.</p>, <p>“Ahjussi, does that mean you actually went to North Korea?”</p>, <p>“No.”</p>, <p>This time, Jeong Eun-taek who was nearby raised his voice with a disapproving expression on his face.</p>, <p>“What? So, are you saying there are this many monsters in Paju capable of producing something like this?”</p>, <p>Hmm… failing to answer this properly could lead to trouble.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“No. I just got it by taking down a smuggler. It probably came from China.”</p>, <p>It’s a complete lie but a somewhat plausible explanation. China with its vast territory hasn’t fully resolved its issues yet. In fact, during gameplay, there are opportunities to visit several places in China. However, following such quests, catastrophic events like the collapse of Beijing or the descent of a calamity tend to occur… It’s generally better to avoid going there if possible.</p>, <p>“Speaking of which.”</p>, <p>I quickly continued the conversation to divert attention before anything more troublesome could be said.</p>, <p>“How much for these?”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek looked skeptical but soon dismissed it with an indifferent remark.</p>, <p>“It doesn’t really matter. 10 each, so 40 in total.”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>These items could easily fetch 120 million if priced generously. Even with a discount, slashing the price to 40 million is outrageous.</p>, <p>“I’d give more if I had the money. But business isn’t easy these days, with the peace and all.”</p>, <p>It was common for players to engage in wordplay like this in the game and nonchalantly throw around figures in the hundreds of millions, so it wasn’t really surprising.</p>, <p>“I’m making a considerable concession here. Just give me 100 million flat.”</p>, <p>“I told you, I don’t have the money.”</p>, <p>“Do you really not have any money?”</p>, <p>“Yes, really.”</p>, <p>He was getting more and more shameless.</p>, <p>“Well, then it shouldn’t matter. I was planning to buy some things anyway, so you’ll have money soon enough.”</p>, <p>“Huh, really? What are you buying?”</p>, <p>I pulled out a piece of paper from my pocket and handed it to Jeong Eun-taek. I had already listed the items I needed.</p>, <p>When Jeong Eun-taek read the list, his already wrinkled face crumpled even more.</p>, <p>“What’s this? Planning to perform a ritual or something?”</p>, <p>“Well, something of the sort. I’ll buy all of this, so just deduct it from the value of the magic stones and give me 100 million in cash.”</p>, <p>“What are you saying? That sounds like highway robbery!”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek had every right to be outraged.</p>, <p>The items I just requested amounted to roughly 50 million won in value.</p>, <p>150 million for four magic stones was on the expensive side even if their purity was high. However, considering the cost of the items, it seemed Jeong Eun-taek would still make a decent profit.</p>, <p>When he realized this belatedly, Jeong Eun-taek’s expression softened.</p>, <p>“You know, this is the same pattern as last time…”</p>, <p>Indeed, the last time I had disposed of other items here, the bargaining followed the same pattern. He seemed to have realized that he had fallen into the same trap again.</p>, <p>“It was you who started this pattern in the first place, wasn’t it?”</p>, <p>“Hmm… Ah, really… planning to clean me out, huh? Just wait.”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek carefully collected the magic stones and went into the inner room where the safe was located while grumbling something along the lines of “I’ve been played!”</p>, <p>And as if she had been waiting for her grandfather to leave, Jeong Ye-eun approached me closely and started a conversation.</p>, <p>“Ahjussi, Ahjussi.”</p>, <p>“Yes?”</p>, <p>“Do you also catch ghosts? Are you a shaman?”</p>, <p>“No.”</p>, <p>“But why do you perform rituals?”</p>, <p>“I don’t do rituals.”</p>, <p>“You said earlier you were going to perform one, didn’t you?”</p>, <p>“I mentioned doing something similar, but when did I say I’d perform a ritual?”</p>, <p>“Hmm… Really?”</p>, <p>Jeong Ye-eun’s expression quickly shifted to one of boredom.</p>, <p>“There’s a ghost coming out of my house every night these days. I’m trying to catch it.”</p>, <p>“Ah, really?”</p>, <p>Ye-eun’s eyes sparkled when I said that. She seemed unexpectedly interested in this topic, which wasn’t evident from our usual interactions in the game.</p>, <p>“Mhmm.”</p>, <p>“But if you’re not a shaman, how do you catch ghosts?”</p>, <p>“It’s similar to catching bugs. You lay down some bait and sticky traps, and the ones meant to die will die, and the ones meant to leave will go… For the tougher ones, just wrap them up in the sticky trap and throw them outside.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… Really?”</p>, <p>This time, she looked skeptical. It looked quite similar to the suspicious expression that Jeong Eun-taek often made which was perhaps because they were related by blood.</p>, <p>When I shared this observation with Ye-eun, she erupted into a furious shout and started thrashing about wildly.</p>, <p>“Hey… if you keep that up…”</p>, <p><em>Crash! Bang…</em></p>, <p>The items behind Jeong Ye-eun tumbled down.</p>, <p>Just when I thought today would be quiet…</p>, <p>Fortunately, things were more organized than last time which prevented a domino effect of disaster.</p>, <p>“Ugh!”</p>, <p>The situation would have remained under control had Jeong Ye-eun not panicked and jumped.</p>, <p><em>Crash, shatter, clatter!</em></p>, <p>I was wrong. Eventually, the commotion escalated to the level of things breaking and getting utterly destroyed.</p>, <p>“Hey, Jeong Ye-eun!”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek burst out with a shout.</p>, <p>“No, Grandpa, this is…”</p>, <p>“Ah… What’s the problem with you… When are you going to get rid of that…”</p>, <p>Jeong Ye-eun tried to dodge Jeong Eun-taek’s wrath with a look of utter defeat, but it seemed an impossible task.</p>, <p>After that, Jeong Eun-taek’s nagging and Jeong Ye-eun’s excuses continued for a long time. When will you ever get your act together? I might as well run the shop by myself. You take your allowance diligently, but why do you always cause such chaos? Ah, Grandpa, give me a break. The real problem here is the mess; things are bound to fall when you pile them up like this!</p>, <p>Not wanting to interrupt their heated exchange, I waited a bit longer, but their argument seemed endless.</p>, <p>“Sir, I should be heading back now.”</p>, <p>“Guh… Yes, go ahead. Off you go.”</p>, <p>Really, this old man… Where was I supposed to go?</p>, <p>“…You need to pay for the magic stones and the items first.”</p>, <p>“Ah, right. Ugh… Jeong Ye-eun! You clean all this up!”</p>, <p>“Ah, Grandpa! How can I clean this up all by myself!”</p>, <p>“I don’t care, girl! Our guest needs to leave!”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek screamed a few more times and then quietly entered the room.</p>, <p>Jeong Ye-eun cast a pleading look my way, but all I could offer in response was a sympathetic gesture.</p>, <p>No matter how much I thought about it, it couldn’t have been my fault. Right?</p>, <p>“Cough!”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek emerged sooner than expected.</p>, <p>Large silver trays piled high with bundles of cash. Why would anyone stash money like that?</p>, <p>Let’s see…</p>, <p>Despite claims of having only 40 million, there were exactly 100 million stacked up.</p>, <p>“You said you only had 40 million, how did you manage to find more?”</p>, <p>Of course, the claim of having only 40 million was nothing more than a shallow trick to lower the price.</p>, <p>In the dangerous back alleys of Paju, could a grandfather who relied solely on his stashed cash for business truly not have a mere 100 million in cash? Inside, there must be hundreds of billions, if not trillions, in cash.</p>, <p>“Hmph.”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek merely snorted at my remark and fumbled with other items he had brought along.</p>, <p>Indeed, that’s the kind of wealth one needs to make money in business.</p>, <p>While Jeong Eun-taek was busy, I took a closer look at the bundles of cash.</p>, <p>“Here. These are the items you asked to be prepared.”</p>, <p>Large chunks of wood, a few boxes, water bottles, and items wrapped in black plastic bags.</p>, <p>“This is a wall-hanging tree… And this water bottle seems to contain purifying water, doesn’t it?”</p>, <p>It was just water in an unlabeled plastic bottle.</p>, <p>Purifying water and wall-hanging trees, as materials, don’t have any significant effects on their own, but when infused with magical power, they can offer great additional effects.</p>, <p>“Yes, that’s right. I received it from the shaman’s house the day before yesterday. It’s not something we always have in stock, so you’re in luck.”</p>, <p>“Good timing.”</p>, <p>“And that large box over there.”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek casually pointed to one of the boxes I was holding.</p>, <p>“This one?”</p>, <p>“Yes, that one. Inside it is a Myeongdu.”</p>, <p>“Ah.”</p>, <p>Myeongdu is a mirror used by shamans during rituals and divinations.</p>, <p>Even though I lacked spiritual abilities and couldn’t use it for divination, imbuing it with certain magic could turn it into a protective amulet against possession.</p>, <p><em>Of course, this wouldn’t prevent the beings of the abyss from creeping into my mind…</em></p>, <p>Perhaps, if done correctly, it could prevent a nightmare or two.</p>, <p>“Thank you.”</p>, <p>“Hmph. Is that all you needed with this?”</p>, <p>“No, there’s one more thing.”</p>, <p>“What now?”</p>, <p>“I’d like to go to Thousand Gold Temple (Cheongeumdang).”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek who had been displaying an annoyed expression on his face until now suddenly contorted his face. After maintaining an ambiguous expression in silence for a moment, he finally spoke up just as his granddaughter Ye-eun began to sense something was amiss.</p>, <p>“…And what makes you think you have the right?”</p>, <p>“I might not have the right, but you could grant it to me, couldn’t you?”</p>, <p>Jeong Eun-taek frowned deeply and then sighed before responding.</p>, <p>“You work under Tudor, don’t you? Did Tudor tell you about this?”</p>, <p>“No, I’m not even under Tudor to begin with.”</p>, <p>“Grandpa, what’s Thousand Gold Temple that you’re reacting like this?”</p>, <p>Jeong Ye-eun was unable to contain her curiosity and asked.</p>, <p>“Thousand Gold Temple is… well, it’s not something you need to be concerned about.”</p>, <p>“Oh, come on, what’s it about?”</p>, <p>“Tell that damned witch Tudor not to bother, as it won’t yield anything.”</p>, <p>“I told you; Tudor hasn’t told me anything.”</p>, <p>“Then who did? Kwang-lim?”</p>, <p>Why is Park Kwang-lim’s name coming up now? If left alone, it seemed like the names of all the brokers in Paju might come out of his mouth.</p>, <p>I tapped my mask idly with my finger before pulling out another item I had brought with the magic stones to show them.</p>, <p>“If you’re reluctant to introduce me, it’s fine. You could just dispose of this for me. If you do, there won’t be any need for me to go to Thousand Gold Temple.”</p>, <p>“What’s this? As if there’s anything in Paju I can’t dispose of…”</p>, <p>What I held in my hand was a very small metallic scale.</p>, <p>Although it has now faded to black, you can still guess its original color if you look closely. It was an object that originally glowed with a magical golden color. This was a scale taken from the body of a golden dancer.</p>, <p>After he examined the scale closely, Jeong Eun-taek recoiled in shock.</p>, <p>“Ah, damn it! You crazy bastard!”</p>, <p>With that, he began to make protective gestures, as if to ward off evil and pulled Ye-eun behind him.</p>, <p>“Ah! Grandpa, why are you doing this?”</p>, <p>“Tell me the truth. Have you crossed the Imjin River?”</p>, <p>“I told you, no.”</p>, <p>“Where else could such a cursed item come from, if not from beyond the Imjin River!”</p>, <p>It had actually come from Tanhyeon located just below the Imjin River. But there was neither the need nor the reason to divulge such information.</p>, <p>“Grandpa, what is that thing?”</p>, <p>“Ye-eun, just stay quiet for a bit!”</p>, <p>Following Jeong Eun-taek’s stern command, Ye-eun shrank back.</p>, <p>“It just so happened that, in my travels, I came across an opportunity to acquire it.”</p>, <p>“Well… it’s your life; ruin it if you want. Who am I to stop you?”</p>, <p>“So, what do you say? Can you write me a recommendation letter?”</p>, <p>“Recommendation letters aren’t just handed out randomly. Besides, there are no openings right now.”</p>, <p>“An opening will come up soon enough. Please put me on the waiting list.”</p>, <p>“Come back in about a week, or better yet, give it two or three weeks. I’ll ask around for you in the meantime.”</p>, <p>“Alright.”</p>, <p>“I can’t guarantee there will be an opening even then.”</p>, <p>“That’s fine. It seems like the best way I can help is by leaving, so I’ll be on my way now.”</p>, <p>“Come again!”</p>, <p>“What are you so excited about?”</p>, <p>“Shouldn’t I say goodbye to the guests when they leave?”</p>, <p>“Is this really the time for that? Oh, wait a minute? This is really broken. Oh dear… How much was this worth…”</p>, <p>Leaving behind the impending quarrel between the two, I hurried out of the pawnshop.</p>, <p>Now, my bag contained items purchased from the pawnshop and 100 million won.</p>, <p>As Jeong Eun-taek had said, there are things that couldn’t be achieved if it wasn’t the right time. Fortunately, I managed to get everything I needed in one go, eliminating the need for a second trip.</p>, <p>While the number and bulk of my possessions had increased, their weight was significantly lighter than that of the magic stones.</p>, <p>The term “magic stones” sounds grand, but in terms of weight, they were essentially no different from chunks of rock.</p>, <p>However, psychologically, the burden felt heavier now.</p>, <p>Including what was already in my bank account…</p>, <p><em>400 million won?</em></p>, <p>In truth, considering the value of the items I had stashed away in my room, this amount wasn’t significant.</p>, <p>If I were to sell all the items I had collected so far, including high-rank artifacts like the Butcher’s Hook, I might have to start counting my wealth in units of 1 billion or even 10 billion won.</p>, <p>If I were still the peaceful Kim Shin-hwa, living in the real world, this amount would have been enough for me to declare my financial independence.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The problem was that I, who possessed this money, was a mage trapped in the crazy world known as [Cthulhu World]. To survive in this world, a vast amount of money was necessary. And when I considered the funds needed for upcoming expenses and various plans, it was clear that this was by no means a large sum.</p>, <p>Moreover, the ludicrous amounts of money could only be reached by handling everything as ideally and safely as possible.</p>, <p><em>It was only because these were magic stones that I could dispose of them without any fuss.</em></p>, <p>For most other items, getting their true value was out of the question, and disposal was often impossible.</p>, <p>Cursed golden scales harvested from the body of the golden dancers. These should have been shared with Jang Hyeon-duk, but he just waved his hands and refused. It was understandable, given the nature of the items.</p>, <p>Where and how could one possibly dispose of such a cursed object?</p>, <p>As could be seen from Jeong Eun-taek’s reaction, ordinary people could face a disaster from possessing even a single scale, let alone disposing of it.</p>, <p>While there might be other methods in different regions, in Paju, there was only one place where such items could be disposed of.</p>, <p>The Thousand Gold Temple</p>, <p>Unlike Jeong Eun-taek’s Geumchon pawnshop, which was clumsily operating as a secret store that wasn’t so secret, the Thousand Gold Temple was a true secret shop. It operated on a membership basis, and access was impossible without an existing member’s recommendation.</p>, <p>I didn’t expect to gain immediate entry. After all, there was a certain level requirement to receive a recommendation from the Thousand Gold Temple’s members. I brought up the Thousand Gold Temple to Jeong Eun-taek today merely to understand how this abstract concept of level restriction worked in practice.</p>, <p><em>Well, I can’t say I wasn’t impatient…</em></p>, <p>Though I was told to wait, it ultimately amounted to a refusal.</p>, <p>Returning 2-3 weeks later would likely result in another excuse and a request to wait.</p>, <p><em>I guess I’ll have to talk to him again after I eventually reach level 30, which is the entry requirement.</em></p>, <p>Currently at level 25, I wasn’t far off.</p>, <p>I had hoped to rid myself of these cursed items sooner rather than later…. but it seemed it would take a bit more time judging by the situation.</p>, <p>After a rare outing, I headed straight to the fridge to stow away the groceries I had picked up on my way back.</p>, <p>Having stayed indoors for a week or more, the brief venture out had been enough for me, and I had no desire to go outside again for some time.</p>, <p>Using my magic, I levitated the items in my backpack into the air.</p>, <p>“Let’s see…”</p>, <p>First, the folder Tudor had handed me.</p>, <p>While I intended to read it at some point, there were other things I wanted to do first. So, with a light gesture towards the folder, it fluttered like wings and settled on a shelf in the corner of the room with a rustle.</p>, <p>As for the other items I had bought from the pawnshop… Various odds and ends floated in mid-air. A water bottle, fragments of a date tree struck by lightning, a stone with strange markings, a few synthetic rubies, a skein of silk thread, a bundle of talismans of uncertain origin, a ritual knife that seemed like it could belong to a shaman, and even a mirror said to ward off possession.</p>, <p>I was about to start the process of transforming these random items into something more valuable.</p>, <p>“Then I guess I’ll have to clear my desk.”</p>, <p>The desk was already overrun with an assortment of items. Things I had brought from the Helistic laboratory, crumpled pieces of paper with magic circle sketches, metal shards, stone fragments, fragments of masks from Tanhyeon, and pieces of the golden dancer’s body.</p>, <p>“I left it untouched while lying around and it has turned into a complete mess.”</p>, <p>Well, moving on to the next task. I summoned my magical power to sweep up the clutter piled on my desk…</p>, <p>Hmm…</p>, <p>“Where should I put this away?”</p>, <p>Indeed, a home must have ample storage space. In the end, I sighed and stacked it in the corner with the other random items.</p>, <p><em>Crash.</em></p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>Scratch that about stacking. The pile I added to toppled over, including the previously piled clutter. The room quickly became a mess. It now looked like the pawnshop after a mishap caused by Jeong Ye-eun.</p>, <p>“I’ll clean it up later…”</p>, <p>Ignoring the hellish scene that seemed as if it were conjured by a demon with OCD, I placed an item on the desk.</p>, <p><em>Clack.</em></p>, <p>[Myeongdu (B-rank accessory): A tool used by shamans or sorcerers for divination or rituals.</p>, <p>Premonition Eye: Increases the effect of the unique trait ‘Divine Energy’ by 30%.</p>, <p>Pasa Wall Head: Blocks the effect of ‘Possession’ with a 60% chance.</p>, <p>Usage Restriction: For those without the unique trait ‘Divine Energy’ it is merely an old antique.</p>, <p>For those without ‘Divine Energy’ special measures are required to use it.</p>, <p>※ Upgradeable]</p>, <p>Shall we get started?</p>, <p>I focused my mind and unleashed the power contained within [Carcosa’s Mask].</p>, <p><em>Whirr…</em></p>, <p>[The unique effect of the L-rank accessory ‘Carcosa’s Mask’, ‘Madman’s Dexterity’, has been activated.</p>, <p>// Madman’s Dexterity: You can unlock the hidden abilities of an artifact or attempt modifications to bestow other powers.

Failure in the check will result in a random mental illness afflicting your mind.]</p>, <p>A sticky, yellowish energy flowed out of the mask. Although it’s out of my line of sight, my ability to sense magical power allowed me to infer its shape and movement.</p>, <p>My head was likely now enveloped in wriggling, undulating yellow tentacles.</p>, <p>Right now, I was in a state where even if someone called me a monster I would have had no words to retort with. Had someone been by my side, they would have surely experienced a terrible horror and dismay at my appearance.</p>, <p>From the mask, translucent yellow tentacles began to caress the Myeongdu placed on the desk.</p>, <p>And then there was another.</p>, <p>[Guardian Amulet of the Ancient God (B-rank Magical Tool): a protective amulet with the power to drive away malevolent forces and weaken beings from the abyss. Blessed with the protection of an ancient deity.]</p>, <p>It was an item I had taken from the abandoned hospital on Gamaksan Mountain. Despite its grandiose description, it was a weak item that was incapable of shielding me from the voices and nightmares that sought to invade my mind.</p>, <p>However, I added a few more items to it. Pieces of wood, high-purity magic stones, golden dancer scales, and even purified water…</p>, <p><em>Whirrrrrr….</em></p>, <p>The ominous yellow light that emanated from the mask began to engulf the entire room. The items I had prepared started to orbit around the Myeongdu which seemed to be pinned in mid-air.</p>, <p>Each item had an ordinary appearance that could be found in a market or an antique store, but now that they received golden magic and began to shine brilliantly, none of the items could be called ordinary.</p>, <p>I summoned more magical power, and Carcosa’s Mask exerted its surreal influence over each object floating above the desk according to my will.</p>, <p><em>Bang!!</em></p>, <p>An explosion-like flash obscured my vision, and the physical structures composing the items I had prepared began to disassemble and decompose. Then, they became entangled as one and started to transform into a new object with a new shape and capabilities.</p>, <p>Fragments of profound wisdom and the laws that constitute the universe began to form in my mind. How insignificant and trivial is the wisdom and knowledge that humanity has accumulated over the years? The great golden master, the indescribable one, the king in yellow who exists on the other side of a distant galaxy bestows upon me deep and deep and deep wisdom. I heard the sound of a golden horn made from curses and poisonous flames trapped underground…</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated. The effects of madness have been nullified.]</p>, <p>“Ah, that was close…”</p>, <p>I thought I had lost my mind for a moment there. It seems the penalty effect associated with the Madman’s Dexterity trait was triggered and it nearly plunged me into a state of madness. This is typical of advanced traits in [Cthulhu World]; rarely are there simply useful traits. The more strong the effect, the more it consumes the user’s mind and destroys the soul.</p>, <p>“So, the Madness of the Abyss trait is actually quite useful, after all.”</p>, <p>The Madness of the Abyss trait forcibly inhabits my mind, resolving all mental issues except for two specific forms of madness. This means that the great beings from the abyss can’t exert their influence over me beyond sending occasional nightmares and minor annoyances from afar.</p>, <p>And now, even those nightmares have come to an end.</p>, <p>[Ancient God’s Mirror (A-rank Accessory): An item imbued with the influence of an ancient god and crafted for communication with divine beings.

I checked the magical power and resources consumed in the enhancement of the artifact.</p>, <p>It didn’t strain my mind too much, but it did consume a significant amount of magical power.</p>, <p>There was also some unexpected physical exhaustion involved…</p>, <p>“Hmm… It seems it’s not something I can use twice a day.”</p>, <p>While I could force it up to three or four times, it wouldn’t be a healthy choice.</p>, <p>Using it just once a day would be sufficient anyway.</p>, <p>“Alright.”</p>, <p>I had become capable of altering, fusing, and enhancing artifacts. If I start to use this ability properly, I could reach a point where mundane financial concerns are irrelevant. The limitation of only being able to use it once a day isn’t really a constraint.</p>, <p>I could transform materials worth a few tens of millions into artifacts worth hundreds of millions, or even billions.</p>, <p>The item I’ve created now is excessively luxurious for just helping me sleep.</p>, <p>I currently possessed abilities that any mage would not find disappointing, yet I couldn’t escape the inherent constraints that came with being a mage. However, I realized that if I started to actively use my artifact enhancement ability, I could transcend those limitations.</p>, <p>Of course, this wasn’t something that could be achieved without any cost. To manifest the desired enhancements, it was necessary to have certain materials on hand in advance. The challenge was that some of these materials couldn’t easily be acquired with money alone.</p>, <p>“Well, Tudor will handle that somehow.”</p>, <p>It seemed that engaging in any other activity for the rest of the day would be difficult. I reached out toward the folder that had been shoved onto a shelf.

            "[<p>Five days passed again.</p>, <p>Although I had resolved three days ago to avoid going out for a while, I found myself frequently venturing outside over the past five days.</p>, <p>I even managed to go out during daylight hours for the first time in a long while, and while my sleep schedule wasn’t quite normal, I was able to adjust it significantly.</p>, <p>This was all thanks to the “Ancient God’s Mirror”, which had effectively shielded me from the nightmares that had been tormenting me.</p>, <p>“Really, there’s nothing like a good night’s sleep.”</p>, <p>Of course, it was evening now, and I was lying in bed as before… But no, it wasn’t quite the same as before. Now, in addition to lying down, I was engaging in another activity.</p>, <p><em>Flap, flap, flap—</em></p>, <p>Although I remained lying down, several books, a notebook, sheets of paper, a pen, and ink were levitating before my eyes.</p>, <p>With a simple gesture, the pages of the book turned.</p>, <p>Another gesture, and droplets of ink that floated as if in zero gravity flew towards the notebook before forming letters. It was as if I had taken notes, but a page’s worth of notes and checklists were completed at the speed of a printer printing them out.</p>, <p>“What’s that word again…?”</p>, <p>My health stat remained at 7 points, but there had been significant changes since my sleep improved.</p>, <p>The fog that had been clouding my mind seemed to dissipate, bringing back a sense of clarity, and my brain started functioning properly, not just in life-threatening situations but in everyday activities.</p>, <p>From the moment I regained my physical and mental composure, I dedicated myself to translating and interpreting the [Silent Scripture of the Dreaming Path].</p>, <p>Until then, I had only used my intelligence for magical purposes, which paradoxically made me less aware of its practical implications. However, once I started applying my intelligence in a practical manner, I began to comprehend the true significance of having an intelligence stat of 30.</p>, <p>The text I was deciphering was in Tibetan, and not just any Tibetan, but a form from the 16th century used in a magical tome. Resources readily available on the market were of little help.</p>, <p>Yet, with just a dictionary borrowed from the library and a few reference materials, I was able to grasp the writings of a certain mad monk who lived in Tibet in the 16th century.</p>, <p>However, this understanding was not complete. The author of the Silent Scripture of the Dreaming Path wrote it based on experiences undergone in a trance-like state. Perhaps during meditation or near-death experiences? I’m not entirely sure if my translation of this part is accurate, but the book was evidently completed based on these profound experiences.</p>, <p>Therefore, the text was filled with oddly connected logic, utterly absurd content, and ambiguous sentences that seemed like the ramblings of a madman. It appeared that a considerable amount of time would be necessary to fully understand the content and make use of the information contained in the book.</p>, <p>However, there were clearly useful aspects as well.</p>, <p>Despite being an old system created before the 16th century, the rituals and magic described in the book were authentic.</p>, <p>“That’s enough for now.”</p>, <p>[System: Your understanding of the Silent Scripture of the Dreaming Path has increased. You have acquired the unique magic ‘Absorption’.]</p>, <p>I was a powerful and unique primal magic that couldn’t be acquired through the [Spell Mastery] trait. In just about a week, I had managed to learn some of these spells.</p>, <p>As my interpretation and understanding of the book deepened, the number of spells I could use would also increase.</p>, <p>“Should I call it a day?”</p>, <p><em>Flap, flap, flap—</em></p>, <p>Thebooks, notebooks, and scraps of paper flew towards the desk.</p>, <p><em>Let’s put this on the desk… but there’s no room left.</em></p>, <p>The already cramped room had become even more chaotic over the course of three days. On the desk lay a pile of broken odds and ends, while the floor around the desk was littered with wooden shards bearing the marks of scorching as if they were discarded trash.</p>, <p>I straightened my back strongly, stretched out both hands toward the desk, and focused my mind.</p>, <p>The size, shape, and weight of piled objects are detected at high speed. And the quick spatial recognition ability gained as a by-product of my magical talent conjured up the optimal arrangement and repositioned the items on the desk.</p>, <p><em>Swoosh… thud, click, click-click!</em></p>, <p>“Ah, that’s better now.”</p>, <p>But if I let my guard down again, it would soon turn into a hellish mess. Since tidying up wasn’t difficult for me, I tended to mess things up again.</p>, <p>When I was about to get up, a strange sound emanated from a corner of the room.</p>, <p><em>Turrrrr—</em></p>, <p>Is that my phone?</p>, <p>I slowly walked in the direction of the refrigerator, and the smartphone flew by itself and stuck to my ear. Since I have overflowing magical power, there’s no need to move much.</p>, <p>There was no need to check who was calling. I had given my number to only two people, and at this hour, there could only be one of them.</p>, <p><em>– Hey dear, how’s it going? Did I call too late?</em></p>, <p>It was Tudor.</p>, <p>“No, I was just about to have dinner.”</p>, <p>I said that and opened the refrigerator. In the past few days, the number of pieces of flesh stored in the refrigerator has increased significantly. This was all thanks to my practice with life-creation magic. There were also numerous glass bottles filled with a specially prepared preservative.</p>, <p>It was time to find separate storage for these, or there’d be no room for food.</p>, <p><em>– You’re having dinner at this hour? Then I guess I don’t need to apologize for calling late.</em></p>, <p>“It doesn’t matter at this time.”</p>, <p>– Yeah, I thought you might be nocturnal.</p>, <p>Tudor giggled joyfully for a moment before continuing.</p>, <p>– Dinner… So, can you drop by Vasilisa after you eat? I don’t know where you live, but if it seems like it’ll take a long time, I can send Orb to meet you.</p>, <p>“What’s up? Is it urgent?”</p>, <p><em>– There’s a request that suddenly came in and it matches the criteria you mentioned last time. But this one is time-sensitive, unlike the usual cases.</em></p>, <p>“It’s not so far away, so there’s no need to send Orb. I’ll be heading to Vasilisa’s place, um…”</p>, <p>I pulled a carton of milk from among the pieces of flesh in the refrigerator. Looks like I’ll have some cereal before I leave.</p>, <p>“…I’ll be there in 30 minutes.”</p>, <p><em>**</em><em>*</em></p>, <p>The value of the items stored in my house is becoming alarmingly high. The number of protective spells I’ve had to place around the house has reached a somewhat exhausting level.</p>, <p>It’s getting to the point where I needed to think of a better security solution since the current method was inconvenient.</p>, <p>After setting up the security spells, I killed some time wandering the back alleys of the Geumchon neighborhood before making my way to Vasilisa.</p>, <p>Tudor was a reliable broker, but I couldn’t place the same trust in the various fixers coming and going through Vasilisa’s doors. Upon seeing my face—or rather, my mask—Tudor didn’t bother with greetings and immediately pulled me into her office.</p>, <p>“You said it would take 30 minutes, and you arrived right on time.”</p>, <p>“As I mentioned earlier, I live nearby.”</p>, <p>“Ah, I see. How are you feeling? You’ve been laying low these past few days. Are you ready to start right away?”</p>, <p>“How soon are we talking?”</p>, <p>“Tonight, or maybe tomorrow during the day?”</p>, <p>“Is it urgent? Similar to the previous task at Munsan Apartment?”</p>, <p>“Well, it’s urgent. Not for me, but for the client.”</p>, <p>That meant it was urgent, didn’t it? The fact that she could joke in such a situation made me wonder if it wasn’t as serious as I initially thought.</p>, <p>As I hesitated, Tudor gave me a slight mysterious smile and continued.</p>, <p>“Urgency aside, there are some details you need to be briefed on, so listen up.”</p>, <p>“What is it? Let’s hear it.”</p>, <p>“It’s about the Triad.”</p>, <p>“The Triad?”</p>, <p>The naming might have evoked associations with the Triad, which was a renowned criminal organization in China but it bore little relation to it.</p>, <p>A criminal organization that exerts extensive influence in the back alleys of Paju in a narrow sense and in the darkness of Korea more broadly…. It was essentially what one might refer to as the mafia.</p>, <p>Given that this was within the realm of [Cthulhu World] where monsters from other dimensions, mutants, and those with supernatural abilities could be used as human resources, the harm they could inflict was on a completely different scale from anything in the real world.</p>, <p>“Last time, it was about building connections with a large company, and now it’s ending up with the mafia?”</p>, <p>“This matter is more than that. If you handle it well, you might establish some very impressive connections for yourself.”</p>, <p>“You’re making it sound complicated. What’s it all about?”</p>, <p>“I’m not sure how much you know about the Triad but it’s an organization run by three leaders.”</p>, <p>The conversation seemed to be going in circles. It was fine to strategically pretend to be ignorant of the political situation in Paju, but it became problematic in situations like this.</p>, <p>It seemed like Tudor kept giving grandiose explanations because of her desire to convey to me how great this event was.</p>, <p>“I’m aware of that much. I even know that the names of those three leaders are Jeok-du, Heuk-wang, and Cheong-ho.”</p>, <p>“Ah, right, you’ve been in Paju for about two months now…”</p>, <p>“Yes. So, there’s no need to explain the Triad to me.”</p>, <p>“Okay. Then let’s get to the main point. One of the three heads of the Triad, Cheong-ho’s daughter, has been kidnapped.”</p>, <p>“His daughter?”</p>, <p>“Yes. There’s a bold and skilled crazy guy who infiltrated the house of a man at the top of the underworld and kidnapped his daughter. The request is to catch this person.”</p>, <p>Twenty years ago,</p>, <p>Ever since it became known that monsters descending from North Korea carried magic stones, treasures more valuable than gold, people from all walks of life flocked to Paju, as well as to Gangwon and northern Gyeonggi provinces.</p>, <p>Among them were criminal organizations, wearing the badge of the mafia… and among these, three of the most powerful joined forces to form the Triad.</p>, <p>If Korea had still boasted the dense public authority of its past, perhaps it could have contained them. However, in the aftermath of the Great Collapse, Korea was too preoccupied with dealing with Cthulhu monsters to pay any mind to the mafia.</p>, <p>Thus, in the shadows of Paju and across South Korea, the Triad grew by devouring the abnormal and crazy interests that were moving rapidly in the darkness of Paju and the Republic of Korea.</p>, <p>It had become a huge criminal organization that could no longer exist in the reality of South Korea.</p>, <p>As such, even within the realm of [Cthulhu World] it was one of the significant forces to reckon with.</p>, <p><em>Of the various possible destruction endings, 20% involve the Triad, either directly or indirectly…</em></p>, <p>This was a request that could place one in a position to bestow a personal favor upon one of the three heads of the Triad. Though Tudor had planned to abandon it due to the lack of a suitable person, it seemed she was inwardly hoping that I would take it on.</p>, <p>The quest proceedings were swift, and soon a quest acceptance message appeared above my head.</p>, <p>[You’ve accepted the quest!</p>, <p>&lt;Search Quest: The Tiger’s Daughter&gt;</p>, <p>The daughter of the Cheong-ho, one of the three heads of the Triad, has been kidnapped by someone. Locate Jeong Hyun-ah and ensure her safety.</p>, <p>! Time Limit: Jeong Hyun-ah will die in (2) hours !</p>, <p>Reward: 450,000XP + Cheong-ho’s Trust + 300,000,000 Won + Bonus depending on mission performance</p>, <p>Failure: You will have a hostile relationship with the Triad.]</p>, <p>The compensation was 300 million won.</p>, <p>If efforts were made to increase the bonus, it was possible to receive up to 540 million won, as I recall.</p>, <p>However, more important than earning an extra sum of money was gaining the trust of Cheong-ho, who held a 30% stake in the Samdoo Association.</p>, <p>Securing his trust would grant me access to restricted infrastructures such as black markets dealing in genuine grimoires or exclusive places like the Thousand Gold Temple.</p>, <p><em>It might require a bit of luck, but if things go well, there would be no need to rack my brains over translating ancient Tibetan texts from the medieval period.</em></p>]\n",

            "[<p>A strange city where individuals suffering from madness and living at the fringes sought to transform their lives by defeating surreal monsters, while corporations wielding technologies that didn’t exist in reality amassed vast wealth.</p>, <p>In the darkness of such a city where no one is crazier than the other, Cheong-ho was one of the three bosses of the underworld who was gaining more notoriety than anyone else.</p>, <p>Cheong-ho was a man surrounded by grand rumors.</p>, <p>Claims of his cruel hands, his ridiculous tendency for violence, or his incurable madness… Listing them all would make for trivial tales.</p>, <p>But aside from such rumors, his love for his daughter seemed genuine at least. As soon as Tudor contacted him, a sleek black luxury sedan swiftly arrived at the entrance of Vasilisa.</p>, <p>It had been less than three minutes since Tudor had hung up the phone.</p>, <p>“You arrived quickly.”</p>, <p>An old man in a suit seated in the driver’s seat responded in a calm voice,</p>, <p>“I was the closest member available.”</p>, <p>It appeared that the nearest available person in their network was mobilized to escort me from Vasilisa.</p>, <p>“The chairman’s house is not far from here.”</p>, <p>“I see.”</p>, <p>“Yes, we should arrive in about 30 minutes, but given the circumstances, I hope you’ll understand if we speed a bit.”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho’s home was a luxurious country house located on the outskirts of Paju.</p>, <p>However, it wasn’t the kind of tranquil setting one might expect for a wealthy retiree to enjoy their later years. In fact, it was more fitting to call it a mansion than a country house.</p>, <p>As soon as we entered the road, the car began to gradually accelerate. Since it was late at night and the roads were empty, the elderly driver seemed to push the speed to its limits. Nevertheless, because the ride was so comfortable and it was a heavy vehicle, there was no major discomfort.</p>, <p>The driver humbly introduced himself as just another member of the organization and revealed his name to be Chae Tae-won.</p>, <p>And I knew his name before he introduced himself.</p>, <p>This implied that he held enough importance in the [Cthulhu World] to make a name for himself and he possessed skills worth remembering.</p>, <p>Of course, depending on how things unfolded, there might never be a need to call his name again, or we could end up in a tiresome cycle of conflict until his dying day.</p>, <p>With his lean build, tall height, and neatly combed hair, along with the composed lines of age on his face, he looked more like a bank president or a high-ranking corporate executive than a field member of an organization.</p>, <p>In reality, his duties weren’t much different from those confined to a desk. That’s because Chae Tae-won was a branch chief managing a branch of the Triad.</p>, <p>In essence, he wasn’t the kind of person one would expect to be performing the role of my chauffeur.</p>, <p>Tudor had jokingly said, “It’s urgent. Not for me, but for the client,” and the client was really in a hurry.</p>, <p>And although the old driver didn’t show it, the situation was really urgent.</p>, <p>This was information that only I knew and that others couldn’t know.</p>, <p>[! Time Limit: Jeong Hyun-ah will die in (2) hours !]</p>, <p>Regrettably, I was entangled in an annoying timed quest. I hoped for minimal disruptions, but the time left was dreadfully short. Any slight mishap could lead to failure, regardless of my capabilities.</p>, <p>And should I fail, the consequence would be…</p>, <p>[Failure: You will have a hostile relationship with the Triad.]</p>, <p><em>Ah, damn it, how troublesome! Why did I have to get stuck with such a quest…!</em></p>, <p>It took about 8 minutes to reach our destination. The car soon began to slow down as it seemed we were almost there.</p>, <p>“Things might get a bit chaotic upon arrival. I ask for your understanding in advance.”</p>, <p>Even though I was wearing a mask, a hoodie, a backpack, and was even carrying a skateboard, Chae Tae-won’s polite attitude didn’t waver one bit. It seemed a waste to simply dismiss him as a gangster.</p>, <p>“I have a rough idea of what’s happening.”</p>, <p>The place was usually guarded by dozens of organization members at all times, but now, the boss’s family had been kidnapped. Likely, hundreds of underlings from the organization had swarmed the place which created a sea of people.</p>, <p>“No, it’s not what you think.”</p>, <p>“…? Then what is it?”</p>, <p>“The police will be there.”</p>, <p>“Ah.”</p>, <p>It reminded me of the situation at the abandoned hospital on Gamaksan Mountain. Due to the dynamic real-time active quest system, the details could vary slightly each time even when undertaking the same quest.</p>, <p>In Gamaksan Mountain, the Wild Guns gang led by Ko Kyung-soo had shown up which resulted in the test subjects being armed with firearms while waiting for me.</p>, <p>This time, the quest involving the boss’s daughter had a low chance of attracting additional NPCs. And with particularly bad luck, a truly troublesome situation could arise.</p>, <p>And the surroundings were really, really, really chaotic.</p>, <p>At the entrance of a large mansion encircled by a high wall, burly gangsters clad in black suits were blocking the way.</p>, <p>Facing off against these gangsters were dozens of police officers. It seemed there had already been a scuffle, as the individuals at the forefront of both groups were in disarray with torn clothes and disheveled hair.</p>, <p>On one side:</p>, <p>“Get lost, now!”</p>, <p>“Bring a warrant!”</p>, <p>“Do you even know where you are!”</p>, <p>On the other side:</p>, <p>“Move aside! Move!”</p>, <p>“Ah, open the door!”</p>, <p>“Do you all want to be arrested?!”</p>, <p>“This is obstruction of official duty!”</p>, <p>Such a scene was not common in Paju.</p>, <p>If this spectacle were to be summarized in a single sentence, it would go something like this:</p>, <p>“It feels more like they’ve come for a raid than to catch a kidnapper.”</p>, <p>Upon hearing my words, Cha Tae-hyun seemed to be struck with a headache so he briefly lowered his head and rubbed his temple with one hand.</p>, <p>“It seems someone is out to give the chairman a hard time.”</p>, <p>“That appears to be… that person over there.”</p>, <p>A woman holding a loudspeaker burst forth from among the police. Navigating through such a dense crowd was no easy feat, but as she pushed through the officers, dozens of burly men were swept aside and parted ways to the left and right.</p>, <p>Ah, this was the worst of the worst.</p>, <p>The NPC who only showed up when luck was at its absolute worst, the nemesis of all the wannabe outlaws in Paju and the town’s most insane civil servant.</p>, <p>It was Yang Seo-ho.</p>, <p>Yang Seo-ho brought the loudspeaker to her lips and bellowed at the gangsters from the Triad right in front of her.</p>, <p>“Ah! Ah! Members of the Triad gang!!!!!”</p>, <p>Though the loudspeaker was no artifact, her shout carried a physical force beyond mere sound.</p>, <p>And when her voice erupted, the gangsters blocking the entrance were visibly shaken and staggered backward.</p>, <p>“We are the righteous and benevolent police, here to find your boss’s daughter!!!! Stop your nonsense and cooperate with us at once!!!”</p>, <p>She was really a crazy woman.</p>, <p>It seemed there was at least one among the Triad with a semblance of courage. A giant man that was easily twice the size of Yang Seo-ho emerged and he was stomping his feet as he walked forward.</p>, <p>“Why do you barge in here causing trouble when we’ve done nothing wrong?”</p>, <p>Though the giant seemed poised to throw a punch at Yang Seo-ho any moment, his body tensed with a surge of energy, and he managed to maintain a look of basic decency on the surface.</p>, <p>On the other hand, Yang Seo-ho, a defender of law and justice, shoved the loudspeaker towards her face and yelled.</p>, <p>“So, you see, we’re here to help find your boss’s daughter, got it? Why don’t you just scram?!!”</p>, <p>Such behavior was nothing short of barbaric and devoid of even the slightest semblance of decency.</p>, <p>The giant man who had initially spoken with restraint clutched his ears at Yang Seo-ho’s shout and staggered back before his face flushed red with anger as he retorted loudly.</p>, <p>“So, I’m telling you, we don’t need you! If you want to enter, bring a warrant!!!”</p>, <p>“I have no intention of laying a finger on your boss, as long as he is a citizen of this great Republic of Korea, and that applies to his daughter as well!!! What I’m after are the kidnappers, so open the door right now!!!”</p>, <p>“What kind of nonsense is this!!! Bring a warrant!!!”</p>, <p>“What’s with you, bastard!!”</p>, <p>Well… I’m not particularly inclined to side with Yang Seo-ho, but there’s really no need to doubt her sincerity. She genuinely doesn’t care if the person in question is a mob boss or a despicable serial killer as long as they are a legal citizen of South Korea with the right to walk on its land.</p>, <p>The reason she was pushing so hard, even at the risk of abuse of her authority, was solely because the target of her pursuit and the kidnapper of Cheong-ho’s daughter was an “illegal alien”—a being from another world.</p>, <p>However, her inflexibility and aggressive approach were only deepening misunderstandings as time passed.</p>, <p>This wasn’t the time to be hiding in Chae Tae-won’s car.</p>, <p>I turned to Chae Tae-won who looked troubled and started the conversation.</p>, <p>“It doesn’t seem like this… situation will resolve easily.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… we’re short on time too…”</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won’s voice trailed off for a moment before he made up his mind and continued.</p>, <p>“I’ll step in and find a way to clear the path.”</p>, <p>“No, no. Wait a moment.”</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won stepping in didn’t guarantee that the way would be cleared. With time already running short, the last thing I wanted was to waste more of it.</p>, <p>“I’ll make my way in through the back on my own.”</p>, <p>“The back door is likely to be in a similar state.”</p>, <p>“Perhaps, if the chairman would allow it, I might quietly climb over the wall.”</p>, <p>“No, I couldn’t possibly ask that of a guest…”</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won looked even more disheveled than when he had watched Yang Seo-ho’s tantrum.</p>, <p>The issue here went beyond mere courtesy to a guest. Regardless of the circumstances, if I were to climb over the wall of the chairman’s house, it would be a matter of pride for the Triad, and Chae Tae-won could face internal embarrassment for failing to perform his duties.</p>, <p>But was I really going to continue wasting time like this?</p>, <p>“We’re running out of time, aren’t we?”</p>, <p>“Hmm… Alright. But please, just wait a moment.”</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won quietly reversed the car. He moved it far enough away so that the gathered police officers couldn’t see, then got out of the car and began to make a call on his smartphone.</p>, <p>It seemed he was either seeking permission…. or at least trying to ensure that no one would be startled by my entry.</p>, <p>The call was brief. Chae Tae-won soon returned to the driver’s seat and his face somehow seemed years older upon his return.</p>, <p>“I’ve relayed the message that you shouldn’t be alarmed by Kim Shin-hwa-nim’s entry.”</p>, <p>“Then I may proceed.”</p>, <p>“Yes, but please be cautious not to enter through a risky area… Do you see where the branches extend over the wall there?”</p>, <p>“I see it.”</p>, <p>“Could you make your entrance near that tree? We’ve arranged for someone to meet you on that side.”</p>, <p>“No problem.”</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won turned his head for a moment and seemed to sigh quietly. After a brief pause, he suddenly changed the subject.</p>, <p>“The chairman is deeply concerned.”</p>, <p>In response to such remarks, silence often serves better than an awkward reply.</p>, <p>“And more than concerning the chairman, I ask again for the young lady’s sake. Unlike us, she’s an innocent girl with no fault of her own.”</p>, <p>“Well, since I’ve accepted the job, I have no intention of doing it half-heartedly.”</p>, <p>“Thank you.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>After getting out of Chae Tae-won’s car, I relaxed my wrists and ankles for a moment and lightly stretched, then put the skateboard I had brought with me on the ground.</p>, <p>There was no need for explosive auxiliary propulsion.</p>, <p>[Agility of the Fox]</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>The black hoodie I wore began to shimmer with intricate patterns of light. The magic circle which was designed more for practicality than visibility or symmetry appeared as a random and chaotic scatter of doodles or graffiti.</p>, <p>The spell to compensate for my lack of agility and to aid in posture control was complete. I stepped onto the board and rolled my feet with ease. In response, the board surged forward with fierce acceleration.</p>, <p>Then came the [Leap].</p>, <p>A silver magic circle that resembled a crack formed on the seemingly ordinary board. And without any other precursor, the board shot into the air as if bouncing off the ground, and with it, I too soared quietly through the cold night air before effortlessly vaulting over the high wall.</p>, <p><em>Whoosh, thump!!</em></p>, <p>The surrounding scenery changed rapidly.</p>, <p>Beyond the wall that frustratingly obstructed my view lay a meticulously maintained garden, the sort one might expect to find in an old mansion.</p>, <p>There, three burly figures in black suits stared at me with shocked expressions.</p>, <p>For a moment, they seemed to have forgotten what to say… Ah, perhaps they didn’t expect someone like me to show up?</p>, <p>“I came here through Vasilisa’s mediation. Aren’t you going to lead the way?”</p>, <p>“Wh-What did you say?”</p>, <p>One of the big men blurted out in disbelief. Clearly, they were unprepared. Just as I was about to speak again, a bald gangster who seemed to hold a slightly higher rank among these similarly imposing men, shouted at his subordinate who had spoken out of turn.</p>, <p>“Ah, no, wait! Make way!”</p>, <p>He then bent slightly towards me with an awkward smile.</p>, <p>“We’ve been expecting you. Please excuse our surprise.”</p>, <p>“Ah, yes.”</p>, <p>“Please come this way.”</p>, <p>Without much talk, I followed him while holding the still-shining board at my side.</p>, <p>Cheong-ho’s house was a vast and splendid mansion; its size was difficult to gauge at a glance.</p>, <p>But just like the chaotic situation outside, the interior was… quite a mess.</p>, <p>First of all, a large cabinet had fallen over.</p>, <p>It must have been a cabinet for storing dishes, but as expected, the dishes that had been stored inside the cabinet were spilled out and smashed to pieces.</p>, <p>Looking at the fragments, they were luxurious plates that appeared to be more for decoration or collection purposes than actual plates for use.</p>, <p>The room was in disarray, with items that could be thrown scattered and smashed all over the place. What must have been a living room filled with luxurious decorations now resembled the aftermath of a rampage by a crazed gorilla with eight flailing arms.</p>, <p>I passed by the servants of the mansion standing outside the living room while muttering helplessly to each other and stepped inside. There, amidst the chaos that matched the disorder of the room, stood a figure that could only be described as deranged.</p>, <p>He was wearing what could be called a formal suit, though its buttons were torn off and the stitching on the left shoulder was completely ripped open. Remarkably, he still wore shoes amidst the chaos.</p>, <p>Even though he looked like a madman, this man in his early fifties was Cheong-ho, one of the three leaders of the Triad.</p>, <p>The scene suggested a brawl with kidnappers, but that was not the case. As if he had guessed what I was thinking, the burly man who had guided me whispered in my ear.</p>, <p>“This was not the work of kidnappers, but our chairman himself.”</p>, <p>“You’re saying the person who trashed the house and beat up the chairman was the chairman himself?”</p>, <p>“Yes, he couldn’t contain his anger…”</p>, <p>It seemed clear enough. Cheong-ho who had his daughter kidnapped right in the middle of the day at his mansion must have been unable to accept the fact and lashed out in a frenzy.</p>, <p>“Who are you?”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho roughly swept his disheveled hair back and looked this way.</p>, <p>As he did so, the large scars crossing his forehead and the area around his eyes that were previously hidden by his hair were revealed.</p>, <p>Now that I took a closer look at him, I could see longer horizontal scars engraved across his body beneath the torn shirt. They looked almost like brutal stripes.</p>, <p>“He is the fixer who came through Vasilisa’s mediation.”</p>, <p>The burly man who was guiding me responded.</p>, <p>“A mage?”</p>, <p>“That’s right.”</p>, <p>“…Ah, this is driving me crazy. Is he any good?”</p>, <p>After seeing this reaction twice in a row, I began to miss the gentle and polite Chae Tae-won. While I was thinking about the polite Chae Tae-won, Cheong-ho slowly began to approach me, all the while glaring at me with bloodshot eyes.</p>, <p>Ah, I remembered that a disastrous event could unfold here if I didn’t handle this situation carefully.</p>, <p>“Let’s stop this, shall we?”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>“Aren’t we in the middle of a crisis? This isn’t some old martial arts film. Wouldn’t it be better to focus on finding your daughter instead of wasting time testing me by attacking?”</p>, <p>“Huh… this bastard…”</p>, <p>However, Cheong-ho didn’t halt his advance. The air became prickly due to the threateningly elevated magical power and killing intent he radiated. Sounds of people collapsing could even be heard from behind. Yet, it wasn’t enough to affect me significantly.</p>, <p>I could stand there forever without any reaction, but that seemed like it would take an eternity. I had no choice but to slightly increase my magical power and slightly push away his own magical power. At that moment, a vein throbbed on Cheong-ho’s forehead and he began to seriously gather his magical power.</p>, <p><em>This won’t do.</em></p>, <p>I extended my magical power and influence in earnest and pushed it against the magical power rising from his body. I could potentially twist his magical power core entirely… but since he was a client, I opted to create a wave of energy opposing his before starting to neutralize the rampant magical power he had summoned.</p>, <p>My magical power control flowed effortlessly, without the need for strain or focus. Even though I was manipulating not my own but my opponent’s magical power, I managed it with perfect precision… But, honestly, this whole ordeal was starting to get on my nerves.</p>, <p>In a moment of impulse, I unleashed my magical power in an instant, grabbed his magical power, and twisted it.</p>, <p>“Aaaaagh!”</p>, <p><em>Thud.</em></p>, <p>Cheong-ho fell back and his face was ashen with shock. Judging by his expression alone, one might think I had twisted his nose or ear rather than his magical power.</p>, <p>“Wh-what are you?!”</p>, <p>“Just as I was introduced earlier, I am a mage and a fixer brought here through Vasilisa’s mediation.”</p>, <p>“No, fu*k, not that! How did you do that just now!”</p>, <p>“Seriously… I came here upon hearing that the chairman’s family had been kidnapped. If I am at the wrong place, then I shall take my leave.”</p>, <p>“N-No, wait! Just a moment! I’m sorry! I apologize! Please, find my daughter, my Hyun-ah! I’ve been out of my mind worrying about my daughter, and I was rude to you!”</p>, <p>I seriously considered turning back or causing a scene, but for the sake of what was to come, I decided to hold back.</p>, <p>“If in the future you want to ask for more than what was proposed in the request, be prepared to offer corresponding compensation.”</p>, <p>“Ah, I understand, I understand! I promise I won’t do it again! I’m truly sorry!”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho who was still seated on the ground approached me in a semi-kneeling position as if pleading.</p>, <p>Seeing an elderly man, who was respected as a legend in his field, rolling on the ground and begging me was… well, satisfying in a way, but also distasteful and somewhat awkward.</p>, <p>“Enough with the pleading; I’d like to discuss the job now.”</p>, <p>Yet, Cheong-ho couldn’t quickly rise to his feet, and it was only after a bit of a commotion, with his subordinates helping him up, that we could start a normal conversation.</p>, <p>Or so I thought. It was premature to call it normal. Cheong-ho, seemingly overtaken by urgency again, began to blurt out his words in a disorganized rush.</p>, <p>“Please, you must find my daughter! She’s been kidnapped! Those damned brutes…! How could they, in broad daylight, and from her own room…! How could this happen when she had over 40 guards?!”</p>, <p>“I can’t understand a thing you’re saying…”</p>, <p>At my response, Cheong-ho started hitting his own head in frustration.</p>, <p><em>Thump! Thump thump thump! Bang! Crack!</em></p>, <p>It wasn’t a sudden turn to self-harm. That’s just how he was. After a while of beating himself up, Cheong-ho finally managed to articulate his thoughts more coherently.</p>, <p>“What can I do for you? I’ll help in any way I can. If you need more people, I’ll provide them; if you need a down payment, I’ll give it.”</p>, <p>“I’d like to see your daughter’s room first.”</p>, <p>“Ah, right. This way, please.”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho’s daughter, Hyun-ah’s room was on the second floor. If my memory serves me correctly, Hyun-ah was a high school student. The room’s interior seemed fitting for her age; though not as messy as Cheong-ho’s living room had been, it was still quite a mess.</p>, <p>What stood out the most was the completely shattered window.</p>, <p>“My daughter, Hyun-ah, what has she done to deserve this?”</p>, <p>Well, the daughter herself wasn’t to blame. However, had she not been Cheong-ho’s daughter, she likely wouldn’t have been kidnapped.</p>, <p>I slowly approached the window. This quest, being time-sensitive, had several fixed clues placed around, unlike other quests where the clues varied according to a few patterns. Naturally, the perpetrator and the location of the kidnapping changed according to these variations.</p>, <p>Players are meant to gather the clues scattered around the room within a limited time, like in an escape room game, to deduce where Hyun-ah was taken.</p>, <p>“It was an inside job.”</p>, <p>“What did you say?”</p>, <p>It might seem trivial, but the shards of the broken window were scattered outside, not inside. This meant it wasn’t an outsider who had broken the window.</p>, <p>I could have slowly revealed each clue one by one while putting on a grand display of deduction, but the thought of doing so felt embarrassingly over the top, so I simply cut to the chase.</p>, <p>“There must have been people who disappeared amidst the chaos.”</p>, <p>“How could this be… Are you saying there’s a kidnapper among my men? What could they possibly gain from this!”</p>, <p>Hmm… That part is rather cumbersome to explain.</p>, <p>“Anyway, I will soon locate your daughter using magic, so please be patient.”</p>, <p>Though it would actually be my memory, not magic, that would find her, the result would be swift either way.</p>, <p>Among the items scattered randomly on the floor, I picked up a piece of paper that stood out due to its unusual shape. It looked like a book cover, but there was no book, just a single cover page.</p>, <p>Fortunately, among the possible locations for the kidnapping, this one was nearby.</p>, <p>“I’ve got it.”</p>, <p>“What did you say? Where is it? Just tell me the location, and I’ll handle the rest!”</p>, <p>Well, that’s one approach. If I just take my fee and leave… I’d be off the hook easily, while Cheong-ho and his men would rush in and cause chaos and havoc, which would eventually lead to Jeong Hyun-ah’s death.</p>, <p>In the long run, this approach would likely cost me Cheong-ho’s trust and any chance of earning additional bonuses based on the success of the mission.</p>, <p>I wasn’t enduring this unpleasant situation and engaging in conversation with Cheong-ho just to earn a quick buck.</p>, <p>“Having too many people involved won’t do any good. Your daughter will end up as a hostage.”</p>, <p>“Please…! Then what should I do?”</p>, <p>I paused to pull up the quest window and check the remaining time.</p>, <p>[! Time Limit: Jeong Hyun-ah will die in (2) hours !]</p>, <p>“The task is to find and safely return your daughter, so I’ll bring her back. All I need is someone to drive the car.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>(TN: Changed Blue Tiger to Cheong-ho. It was a name after all. I just keep overthinking stuff. Sorry, it has been corrected in every chapter.)</p>, <p>“Besides, with the police spread out like that outside, how do you plan to mobilize people?”</p>, <p>From the first floor, the outside was out of sight because it was hidden behind the fence but now we were on the second floor. The situation outside the fence was visible through the shattered windows.</p>, <p>“Jeong Cheong-ho-sshi! We are here for you! Please open the door and cooperate with the management bureau!”</p>, <p>The amplified voice of Yang Seo-ho resonated loudly through the loudspeaker.</p>, <p>A quick glance revealed that the bulky gangster blocking Yang Seo-ho was… lying down. He wouldn’t have laid down because he suddenly didn’t want to stand, so it seemed like Yang Seo-ho must have knocked him down when I wasn’t looking.</p>, <p>That’s one hell of a woman.</p>, <p>“I-I understand. Then… I will assign someone to the task.”</p>, <p>Then Cheong-ho suddenly started frantically searching himself while muttering, “Where did it go? Hey, where is it?” as he urged his subordinates. Time was running short, and this was frustrating.</p>, <p>“Are you looking for the smartphone that was rolling around on the living room floor, split in half?”</p>, <p>“Ugh, it seems I threw it away earlier. Hey, give me the phone, the phone!”</p>, <p>“It would be good if you could assign Chae Tae-won-sshi to the task. He’s still around and can move immediately.”</p>, <p>“Oh, Tae-won? Alright.”</p>, <p>[! Time Limit: Jeong Hyun-ah will die in (1) hour !]</p>, <p>A new message window popped up in front of me, updating the remaining time for Jeong Hyun-ah’s life. It seems an hour has already passed due to various human interferences.</p>, <p>While checking the situation outside, I reached out for a few drops of blood left among the shattered glass fragments. The blood had already dried completely after several hours.</p>, <p>It’s not a big problem. I summoned magical power to impart additional properties to the bloodstain, and as I did, the dried blood began to wriggle and move slightly like a living amoeba. The bloodstains gathered into one spot and became a single drop of blood.</p>, <p>[Binding]</p>, <p>I created a very small barrier to pick up the drop of blood. Then, I activated a new spell to extract information contained in the blood.</p>, <p>[Insight]</p>, <p>The blood’s owner is… a female, about 18 years old. Fortunately, it seems to be Jeong Hyun-ah’s blood. Additionally, if desired, I could obtain various physical information such as the blood owner’s unique characteristics, stats, food preferences, etc., but that’s not necessary right now.</p>, <p>I could deduce Jeong Hyun-ah’s location based on the information provided by the quest but in case of any unexpected situations, this blood could be used to pinpoint her exact whereabouts.</p>, <p>“There’s no time. Please make the call.”</p>, <p>I hurriedly dashed down to the first floor, grabbed the board I had left outside, and threw it towards the fence before leaping over it.</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>It was urgent, very urgent.</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>I conjured telekinetic mid-air force to pull the board towards me, dragging it under my feet. When I landed, I mounted the board and headed straight for Chae Tae-won’s car.</p>, <p>“Have you received a call from the chairman?”</p>, <p>“Not yet, but… please get in.”</p>, <p>It was only after I got into the car that Chae Tae-won’s phone rang. It was a call from Cheong-ho. The chairman sure was taking his time.</p>, <p>“The location isn’t far. Please head towards the publishing district.”</p>, <p>“The publishing district?”</p>, <p>“Yes, you know, the place where all those bankrupt publishers from about ten years ago are clustered. She’ll be in one of those warehouses.”</p>, <p>A book cover had been found in Jeong Hyun-ah’s room. It was the cover of a book that had never been distributed because the publisher went bankrupt before its official release. Normally, the regular route is to reach the publishing district only after wandering around using the cover as a clue.</p>, <p>“Understood.”</p>, <p>“We’re short on time… I’d appreciate it if you could speed up a bit.”</p>, <p>At my request, Chae Tae-won flashed a brief smile.</p>, <p>“Then… I will speed up for a moment.”</p>, <p><em>Screeech!! Vrooooom!!</em></p>, <p>Chae Tae-won’s car suddenly burst forward with much more energy than before. The abrupt start followed by a series of sharp turns almost made me lose my balance and fall from the back seat. Had it not been for the posture-correcting spell I had applied earlier to prepare for the leap, I would have surely fallen.</p>, <p>It won’t take long to reach the publishing district from here. Roughly 20 minutes? No, perhaps only 10 minutes.</p>, <p>The car we were in completely disregarded the road traffic laws and sped through at an incredible speed.</p>, <p>Overtaking vehicles, ignoring lanes…</p>, <p><em>Thump-thump-thump-thump.</em></p>, <p>The sound of the lane dividers hitting the car could be heard.</p>, <p><em>To drive this fast in such an expensive car.</em></p>, <p><em>Whooooosh.</em></p>, <p>“But…”</p>, <p>It was only after we had reached a somewhat clearer stretch of road that Chae Tae-won, who had been driving with a serious expression on his face, suddenly spoke.</p>, <p>“I’m not sure of the young lady’s current condition, but do you think just the two of us, Mage-nim and me, will be enough?”</p>, <p>“Aaah, the kidnappers?”</p>, <p>“Yes. While many officers are currently tied up, there are also teams scattered in and around Paju searching for the young lady. We could get in touch with them… or, alternatively, there are other members from the Triad.”</p>, <p>Indeed, if Cheong-ho were to mobilize his forces in earnest, he could potentially gather hundreds of men. It’s a matter of pulling together manpower from the other heads of the Triad.</p>, <p>But there is no need. The reason I refused Cheong-ho’s support was to monopolize any rewards from dealing with the kidnappers and to maximize the ransom. I wouldn’t have accepted this request in the first place if I intended to finish it with just basic help and guidance.</p>, <p>“It’s alright.”</p>, <p>“Um… but still…”</p>, <p>“I have someone else to help.”</p>, <p>Saying this, I fumbled with the backpack I had placed on the seat next to me. I could feel something wriggling inside the backpack.</p>, <p>Soon, we arrived at our intended destination.</p>, <p>It’s the area once known as the Paju Publishing District. Of course, ever since Paju changed, the incentive to operate a business in this area vanished. Ironically, in a city overrun by monsters and outlaws, land prices soared.</p>, <p>Small factories and companies in Paju moved south in search of safer and cheaper locations, and the vacancies were filled by the assets of large, suspicious and wealthy companies that could withstand the city’s dangers or utilize the resources it provided.</p>, <p>The same goes for the publishing district. Although the citizens of Paju still refer to it as such, not a single business related to publishing remains.</p>, <p>“Please stop here.”</p>, <p>What normally would have been a 20-minute drive took us just over 10 minutes, thanks to the speeding and reckless driving.</p>, <p>I felt a bit queasy from the ride, but I quickly regained my composure and surveyed the surroundings.</p>, <p>Several buildings clustered together caught my attention. Some of which seemed to be in operation and some of which were not.</p>, <p>More precisely, there were factories that appeared deserted yet strangely continued to produce something.</p>, <p>There were also mysterious secure warehouses whose contents and owners were unknown.</p>, <p>And then there were buildings that had become the homes of bizarre tribes of indeterminate origin.</p>, <p>Although not a completely wild hazard zone like Tanhyeon, it was a gathering place for elements that were even more dangerous and unsettling.</p>, <p>“It might be best not to get too close. It could be troublesome if we’re spotted by lookouts.”</p>, <p>Getting caught by someone on watch could provoke an unpredictable response.</p>, <p>I explained this to Chae Tae-won as we parked the car a safe distance from the warehouse.</p>, <p>From here, we were out of sight from anyone inside the warehouse.</p>, <p>“I’ll come with you.”</p>, <p>Hmm… Chae Tae-won? What should I do?</p>, <p>“Well, alright. But I’ll go ahead to scout first. I’ll signal you, so follow at your own pace.”</p>, <p>“Let’s do that.”</p>, <p>Leaving Chae Tae-won in the car, I stepped out first.</p>, <p>Time for a deep breath. Ah, I feel queasy.</p>, <p>Then, I activated the enchantments I’d prepared:</p>, <p>[Hazy Presence]</p>, <p>[Fox’s Agility]</p>, <p>[Cat’s Elegance]</p>, <p>[Eagle Eye]</p>, <p>If it were a situation where it couldn’t be used, that would be one thing, but if it could be used, there was no reason not to.</p>, <p><em>I have an abundance of magical power anyway.</em></p>, <p>I habitually checked the amount of magical power in my mana core.</p>, <p>The magical power hadn’t decreased in the slightest.</p>, <p>It wasn’t my first time embarking on a quest.</p>, <p>However, since this was a quest with a lot of randomness, I couldn’t let my guard down.</p>, <p>Had the situation been more relaxed, I would have engaged in conversations with NPCs or conducted some preliminary research to understand what awaited me or what traps might be present. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the chance to do so.</p>, <p><em>It doesn’t seem like a typical criminal would be waiting.</em></p>, <p>The appearance of Yang Seo-ho was a precursor. Illegal aliens. Not just the undocumented immigrants who had crossed over from foreign countries, but beings from other dimensions that had infiltrated Earth through supernatural barriers were expected to appear.</p>, <p>While it was unlikely that an enemy I couldn’t handle at my current level would appear, the presence drawn by the [Feast’s Offering] trait could introduce unpredictable variables. Once these beings became involved, whatever awaited me could escalate into a problem beyond my ability to manage.</p>, <p>That’s why…</p>, <p><em>There’s no such thing as being too prepared as a mage.</em></p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Distortion Field]</p>, <p>[Detection Jamming]</p>, <p>After applying several protective measures to myself, I moved towards the warehouse.</p>, <p>I leaned against the wall of another unrelated warehouse for cover and checked the entrance.</p>, <p><em>There’s a surveillance team in place.</em></p>, <p>A man and a woman were seated amongst the scattered waste materials at the entrance of the warehouse.</p>, <p>Their demeanor suggested they were taking an easy break after finishing some work, but what kind of work could possibly be done in an abandoned warehouse with no owner in sight?</p>, <p><em>But their attire and physique hardly fit that of criminals, let alone manual laborers?</em></p>, <p>At best, they might pass for office workers enjoying some break time.</p>, <p>Their appearance seemed somewhat out of place for the situation they were involved in.</p>, <p>It looked like they were resting leisurely after finishing work, but what would they do in an abandoned warehouse without an owner in the first place?</p>, <p>I summoned my magical power to inspect the inside.</p>, <p><em>The warehouse interior has exactly 60 sources of magical power.</em></p>, <p>Although there was one particularly strong source of magical power, the rest were rather trivial.</p>, <p><em>Outside… wait, what?</em></p>, <p>Something was off.</p>, <p>Standing at the entrance of the warehouse… that surveillance team.</p>, <p>I could only see two humans outside, but I detected four sources of magical power.</p>, <p><em>What’s this now?</em></p>, <p>Was something hiding?</p>, <p>[Invisibility Detection]</p>, <p>Even with the ability to detect invisible entities, nothing was caught. It wasn’t a case of something being camouflaged or hidden.</p>, <p><em>Tch, no choice then.</em></p>, <p>Expanding my detection range any further would be too risky.</p>, <p>If there is someone with significant skill, a mage, or a detection device, my location might be revealed….</p>, <p><em>You can’t stick your head into a hole when you don’t know what’s inside it.</em></p>, <p>[Magical Power Detection], [Temperature Detection], [Soul Detection], [Vitality Detection], [Sound Detection], [X-Ray Vision]…</p>, <p>I activated a variety of detection spells at the same time.</p>, <p>Only then did I begin to understand the situation.</p>, <p><em>As I suspected, they’re illegal aliens.</em></p>, <p>Though they appeared to be one person to the naked eye, they were not.</p>, <p>Other life forms with alien magical powers were inhabiting their bodies.</p>, <p><em>The [Parasites].</em></p>, <p>They were also known as “body snatchers”.</p>, <p>Like the Mi-go, these aliens were monsters that began appearing around the world at some point.</p>, <p>They burrow into human brains, consume them….and then take full control of the bodies.</p>, <p><em>Yang Seo-ho would be delighted to hear about this.</em></p>, <p>These creatures are among the “illegal aliens” as defined by the immigration bureau.</p>, <p>The influx of creatures from another world was concerning, but these particular ones had seamlessly infiltrated our midst and their numbers were multiplying like cockroaches. Consequently, they were almost archenemies of the immigration bureau.</p>, <p>Nonetheless, there was one thing that offered some relief.</p>, <p><em>As long as I don’t make any loud noises, I shouldn’t be discovered right away.</em></p>, <p>They weren’t particularly adept at magic or endowed with exceptional detection abilities.</p>, <p>However, they possessed other troublesome skills that did not warrant immediate concern for the moment.</p>, <p>Having assessed the situation, there was no need for further hesitation.</p>, <p>I activated the magic with both hands together.</p>, <p>[Living Flesh]</p>, <p><em>Ziiiip…</em></p>, <p>That was the sound of the zipper on my backpack opening.</p>, <p>Through the parted zipper, a nauseating pink mass began to squirm out.</p>, <p><em>Gulp… Gulp… Splat…</em></p>, <p>“Alright, today’s assistant is ready for action.”</p>]\n",

Mental strength failed.]</p>, <p>The fragile human psyche could easily shatter at the mere exposure to such horrific sights and sounds.</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated.]</p>, <p>Of course, I was an exception.</p>, <p>Though without my unique trait, I would have succumbed to madness and distortion right here.</p>, <p>The creatures attempted to extend their bizarre ganglions in place of limbs.</p>, <p>These ganglions contained a potent hypnotic substance capable of robbing the target of their physical freedom and will.</p>, <p>But… right now!</p>, <p>Cha Tae-won emerged from behind the parasites and spun his body with incredible speed.</p>, <p><em>Woosh!</em></p>, <p>A fierce kick flew towards the parasites with a terrifying sound that cut through the air.</p>, <p><em>Crack!</em></p>, <p>A sturdy shoe sole reinforced with metal plates. The alien life form, which had evolved to shed most of its defenses in favor of parasitizing other creatures’ bodies, was reduced to mush and sent flying with a single kick from Cha Tae-won.</p>, <p>At that very moment, my magic activated.</p>, <p>[Rope Manipulation]</p>, <p><em>Whoooosh!!</em></p>, <p>The nearest rope. It was a spell I had always used for intestines, not rope, but today I cast it against something other than intestines. Of course, that didn’t mean that intestines were rope either.</p>, <p>The magic was triggered on the ganglions of the parasite, which were now mushy and flying in the air. My rope manipulation spell swiftly took control of the dead parasite’s tendrils, sending them flying in an unexpected direction.</p>, <p>Toward the other parasite that had not been hit by Cha Tae-won’s attack.</p>, <p>“Don’t, don’t come here!”</p>, <p>It was futile.</p>, <p><em>Shwalala!</em></p>, <p>The ganglions of dozens of tendrils began to entangle the creature chaotically.</p>, <p>Soon, the two parasites were knotted together so tightly that they couldn’t be separated by normal means.</p>, <p>“Ah, was my assistance unnecessary in this situation?”</p>, <p>“It seems so… but your help was appreciated. Thank you.”</p>, <p>“Don’t mention it.”</p>, <p>“Re-release meee!!”</p>, <p>The last scene was a chilling scream from the parasite entwined with the corpse of its comrade. The creature struggled to free itself from the tendrils of its fallen ally, but the more it moved, the more deeply it became entangled and intertwined.</p>, <p>“Are you having fun?”</p>, <p>“Can’t you untangle this now? If you don’t free me immediately, I’ll kill you all!!!”</p>, <p>Although beings from other worlds tend to look down on humans, these creatures were particularly arrogant.</p>, <p>“Are you dumb? Do you think we’ll release you just because you ask?”</p>, <p>“You bastard!!!”</p>, <p>Its screams were so loud that I had to check if the [Sound Refractor] I had set up at the entrance of the warehouse was still functioning properly.</p>, <p>These small ones sure had powerful lungs.</p>, <p>The act of parasitizing and dominating a human body was just the beginning for them. They continually sought out humans of higher status to take over their bodies. Eventually, they planned to infiltrate the bodies of the ruling class and manipulate humanity from behind the scenes.</p>, <p>“You pathetic humans! You’re nothing but livestock to us! We feed on you; we ride upon you. Killing me now is pointless! We will continue to multiply, and you will never be able to find us all! Someday, the bodies of your family, your friends, and your lovers will fall into our hands. When that day comes… Urk! Urgh!!”</p>, <p>The noise was truly unbearable. I moved a tendril still under my control to silence the creature’s mouth. Despite this, it writhed vigorously in an attempt to escape.</p>, <p>It had almost become like a tightly balled-up skein of yarn at this point.</p>, <p>“Do you realize that the more you squirm, the less likely you are to get free?”</p>, <p>“Mmph, mmph, mmph!”</p>, <p>Given that its bronchial tubes were somewhat similar to a human’s, it would inevitably suffocate to death if I just left it alone.</p>, <p>I stopped paying attention to the guy who could no longer make a sound and activated the detection spell again. There are exactly 60 magic power sources detected inside.</p>, <p>Since two sources of magical power constituted one body, the actual number of parasites inside was…</p>, <p>“There are 30 more of these guys inside.”</p>, <p>“I see…”</p>, <p>Cha Tae-won spoke with a hint of confusion in his expression. It seemed he had managed to maintain his calm upon witnessing the grotesque parasite, but the sight had still visibly shaken him.</p>, <p>“I’ve encountered monsters before, but never anything like these. What on earth are they?”</p>, <p>“They’re ones of the illegal aliens that the management bureau is looking for. The difference is that they are real aliens, not foreigners.”</p>, <p>“Do you know how to deal with them?”</p>, <p>“There’s nothing particularly remarkable about it. Once you kill one, smash the head and the main body will emerge. If you come into contact with its tendrils, you could be hypnotized or even have your body taken over. Be careful not to touch them.”</p>, <p>“You make it sound so simple. Is this why you refused backup?”</p>, <p>Bringing too many people along carelessly could have led to chaos if any of them had been taken over in an instant.</p>, <p>Moreover, if I ended up attacking members of the Triad whose bodies had been taken over, I could be wrongly accused.</p>, <p>“I wasn’t entirely sure, but I suspected these creatures might be here. Yang Seo-ho wouldn’t have acted without good reason.”</p>, <p>“I see. Wait a moment. Then, could it possibly be they who have kidnapped the young lady?!”</p>, <p>Indeed.</p>, <p>Since there’s one creature per human head, the numbers wouldn’t add up if there were an even number of hosts.</p>, <p>Including the kidnapped Jeong Hyun-ah, the magical power sources that must be detected within the warehouse should be an odd number.</p>, <p>“Right now, a coming-of-age ritual is likely taking place inside that warehouse.”</p>, <p>“Coming-of-age ritual? What’s that?”</p>, <p>“It’s a ritual where a juvenile who is yet to possess a human body is granted a new human body.”</p>, <p>[!

            "[<p>I stepped into the warehouse together with Chae Tae-won.</p>, <p>The warehouse was cluttered and grimy inside, yet it seemed to have been in normal operation until quite recently.</p>, <p>Everywhere I looked, large old shelves were arranged to form walls and these shelves were laden with goods whose origins were difficult to determine.</p>, <p>This arrangement significantly limited our field of vision, and it wasn’t long before I realized that these goods were not placed randomly.</p>, <p><em>These aren’t just stacked randomly.</em></p>, <p>It looked like someone had deliberately calculated the layout to naturally divide the space.</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won seemed to have the same thoughts as me and he whispered to me with a cautious look.</p>, <p>“The structure seems a bit odd.”</p>, <p>“It seems like someone has deliberately calculated to naturally divide the space.”</p>, <p>“A maze… Is that what it is?”</p>, <p>“Yes. Probably to slow down the entry of outsiders and to conceal whatever is in the deepest part.”</p>, <p>This wasn’t a structure thrown together overnight. Someone must have taken a long time to slowly rearrange the warehouse’s structure to divide the huge space with no partitions and hide what was inside.</p>, <p>As we moved further inside, a faint smell of blood mixed with sulfur began to emerge.</p>, <p>It wasn’t a fresh scent; blood had been spilled here numerous times before.</p>, <p>Over and over again.</p>, <p>Humans must have been kidnapped and brought deep inside for rituals of breeding and parasitism.</p>, <p>There were a total of sixty sources of magical power detected within the warehouse.</p>, <p>Most possessed a moderate level of magical power.</p>, <p>They were probably on par with the ones we had just encountered outside. Judging by their forms and poor abilities, the ones we saw earlier were clearly young beings that hadn’t been parasitizing human bodies for long.</p>, <p>However, among these young ones, there was one that stood out with exceptionally strong magical power.</p>, <p>It wasn’t as formidable as Je Mu-gyeong, whom I had faced not long ago, but it was still significantly challenging. This wasn’t an opponent that could be easily blown away.</p>, <p>It seemed to be the adult body among them and possibly their matriarch…</p>, <p>“This place appears to be a colony of an adult body that recently became independent and began actively breeding.”</p>, <p>“Independent… You mean there are more like this?”</p>, <p>“Yes, and this is just the beginning. The numbers will grow exponentially as time goes by.”</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won let out a low groan.</p>, <p>But there was no room for further discussion.</p>, <p>A sinister and low voice began to emanate from deeper within.</p>, <p>Accompanied by the low rumble of percussion instruments.</p>, <p>“Y’aaaaa… G’anghel, fai… Ngath… Fhaagh.”</p>, <p>“Uaaah… Chug Ahi al buh buh… Ph’nglui mgagn K’yarnakagn…”</p>, <p>The alien language repeated like a chant.</p>, <p>Just by listening to that voice, you could become brainwashed and go crazy.</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated. The effect of mind control has been nullified.]</p>, <p>As long as I had the “Madness of the Abyss” trait, I would be unaffected.</p>, <p>The problem lies with Chae Tae-won.</p>, <p>He looked like he was trying hard to stay calm, but his complexion was not good. Given his experiences in Paju, he has likely faced his fair share of psychics and mutants. However, those encounters were within the realm of human experience.</p>, <p>Facing such an extreme anomaly and surreal situation must be incredibly difficult for him to accept.</p>, <p>However, there was no time to hesitate. As I moved toward the source of the sound, I spotted a passage leading into the deepest part of the warehouse. Beyond this passageway, the nest of the parasites would likely be revealed.</p>, <p><em>Tch, they’re so careful.</em></p>, <p>Regrettably, there was a guardian at the passage. A parasite inhabiting a human body. I signaled Chae Tae-won and just like we did outside, I cast the [Sound Distortion] spell to silence our movements.</p>, <p>Almost at the same time that I cast the spell, Chae Tae-won sprang into action.</p>, <p>He leaped onto a nearby shelf in a single bound and, with a motion akin to running along the wall, he launched himself at the parasite standing guard. What followed was a ruthless kick.</p>, <p><em>Crush!</em></p>, <p>The force was tremendous. The head of the guard kicked by his magical power-infused foot was torn off in one go, and the head containing the parasite’s main body was sent flying. But, what do we do about the head being sent off like that?</p>, <p>[Arrow of Destruction]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Poison]</p>, <p>I launched a bolt of poisonous nether energy toward the flying head, and the parasite that was pierced died before it could escape from the head.</p>, <p>“Kicking it off like that could have allowed the main body to escape and hide.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… I intended to crush the head completely, but I seem to have misjudged my strength.”</p>, <p>He almost talked like Curtain Call. Are people who rely on physical strength generally like this? Or perhaps not. It appeared he was beginning to be overwhelmed by the surreal circumstances at hand. That likely led to his hasty and irrational decisions.</p>, <p>Of course, it would be nice if that madness could be changed to recklessness like in the case of Curtain Call, but the Chae Tae-won I remembered, the one I had seen in the game, was not that type of person.</p>, <p>“Let’s go inside.”</p>, <p>“Wait a moment.”</p>, <p>I called Chae Tae-won to a halt.</p>, <p>“Branch Manager, you seem to be losing your composure.”</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>I pointed at his fist. He had been clenching his fist so tightly that his knuckles had turned white. Realizing what I meant after he looked at his hand, Chae Tae-won responded with a flustered expression.</p>, <p>“This…. I came here to help, but I almost ended up causing you trouble.”</p>, <p>“It’s okay. However, these creatures feast on human brains. I am worried you might lose your composure at the sight awaiting us.”</p>, <p>With those words, I cast a spell on his mind.</p>, <p>[Courage of the Lion]</p>, <p>[Exhilaration]</p>, <p>“This…?”</p>, <p>The sight that awaited us was beyond what Chae Tae-won could handle.</p>, <p>Thus, I infused his mind with the strength to cope with the instability and the will to not flee.</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won’s body seemed to have rejuvenated and his expression showed considerable vitality.</p>, <p>“Your movements earlier were impressive. Let’s approach it that way.”</p>, <p>Saying so, I gestured towards the top of the shelves forming the walls.</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won looked in that direction and flashed a somewhat sheepish smile.</p>, <p>“It’s embarrassing, but I understand.”</p>, <p>With those words, Chae Tae-won’s body quickly ascended. He reached the topmost shelf with the silence of a ninja before crouching down and slowly moving forward.</p>, <p>He makes the warrior class look enviable. The last character I played was a warrior too…</p>, <p>[Sound Distortion]</p>, <p>I lacked the confidence to move as silently so I distorted the sounds around me as I moved.</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>I gestured for Chae Tae-won to wait a moment and then went ahead. Traditional tactics would have the one with brute force take the lead…. but I guess I’m just worried.</p>, <p>As I went a little further inside, we were met with a scene starkly different from the rest of the warehouse.</p>, <p>It was a space as large as a classroom, completely empty as if all the furniture had been removed. The floors and walls of this barren space were marred by unpleasant mucus and dried bloodstains scattered around.</p>, <p>A large pentagram was drawn in the middle of the floor of that space, and a girl was lying in the center of the pentagram.</p>, <p>She was wearing a robe and had glass cuts on several parts of her body.</p>, <p>It was Jung Hyeon-ah.</p>, <p>There were no restraints binding her, nor did she appear to be unconscious. Jung Hyeon-ah simply stared into the void as she lay there with an expression that showed no emotions or thoughts.</p>, <p>She was likely immobilized by some nerve agent with hypnotic effects.</p>, <p>At each corner of the large pentagram where Jung Hyeon-ah lay stood a human being</p>, <p>They were five in total. The remaining twenty or so individuals stood outside the pentagram and they were observing the ongoing ritual with respectful postures or playing strange-shaped instruments.</p>, <p>The visible participants varied in gender, age, clothing, and everything else.</p>, <p>The term “human” might not even be appropriate here.</p>, <p>They were not living humans.</p>, <p>They breathed, spoke, and even possessed magical powers…</p>, <p>But inside their heads lurked grotesque alien life forms instead of brains.</p>, <p>And the one with the strongest magical power among them.</p>, <p>The parasite wearing the body of a middle-aged man in a gray suit stepped out of his designated spot and slowly walked into the pentagram.</p>, <p>He started to speak.</p>, <p>“O great and invulnerable Daemon Sultan, the blind idiot god, the true king of this universe who dreams the cosmic dream.”</p>, <p>His words flowed continuously.</p>, <p>“Our Lord has granted permission for the ritual of proliferation.”</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä!”</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä!”</p>, <p>A dark purple magical power started to emanate from the pentagram drawn on the floor.</p>, <p>Before I knew it, the magical power that had seeped into my surroundings was about to envelop my body.</p>, <p>It was slow… but was unmistakably beginning to corrode my mind.</p>, <p><em>Crackle…</em></p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated.]</p>, <p>A spark flickered at my temples as the trait activated.</p>, <p>The approaching purple magical power was stopped and it recoiled away. It was a good decision to enter before Chae Tae-won.</p>, <p>Although it caused a slight noise, fortunately, they were too engrossed in their ritual to notice my presence.</p>, <p>These guys worshiped the greatest evil that may as well be the starting point of the universe, the [Blind Idiot God].</p>, <p>He was different from the other abyssal beings that voraciously expand their followers.</p>, <p>He required neither worshippers to serve him nor monuments or temples to commemorate his existence.</p>, <p>The [Blind Idiot God] harbored no will to act on his own.</p>, <p>It was simply an entity of conceptual existence, an ideological principle, or merely a force of pure power that had been since the dawn of time.</p>, <p>Yet, despite this, certain ancient rituals passed down through the eons allowed one to borrow his power for a time. The ritual being conducted by the creatures now was one such ancient ritual.</p>, <p>The murmured incantations stopped.</p>, <p>The adult parasites that had entered the pentagram turned to Jeong Hyun-ah and their grotesque smiles widened as they spoke to her.</p>, <p>From their mouths…. voices so unnaturally sweet and gentle flowed out.</p>, <p>“Do not fear, child of humanity.”</p>, <p>“There will be no pain, no suffering.”</p>, <p>“We shall grant you only joy, happiness, and pleasure.”</p>, <p>“Lose the recognition you unfairly gained and return to your innocent past life. A life of obedience, a life of servitude suits you.”</p>, <p>“Accept it. Accept it. Accept it.”</p>, <p><em>They’re spouting a lot of sh*t.</em></p>, <p>At this time, among those outside the pentagram, a particularly large man walked in.</p>, <p>His mouth began to open.</p>, <p>It opened wide.</p>, <p>Unnaturally wide. Even surpassing the physical limits one might expect.</p>, <p>And then from that gaping maw, a small parasite crawled out.</p>, <p>It was a hideous monster, neither human nor insect.</p>, <p>The sight was so bizarre that it would shatter the sanity of anyone in Paju. No, anyone in the entire world.</p>, <p>And with that, a new message window appeared and blocked my view.</p>]\n",

What is this thing!”</p>, <p>The strange magical creature that was wriggling like a large amoeba or predatory cell instantly wrapped itself around the young parasite’s body and began to assimilate itself with its body.</p>, <p>“Screeee…eek!!”</p>, <p>The young parasite desperately sent a cry of help to the adult parasite.</p>, <p>“Stop, stop it! My child!!!”</p>, <p>But it was already too late. The lump of flesh that had fully enveloped the young parasite sprang up and fled beyond the confines of the pentagram. It was now quietly completing its predation activities in the darkness.</p>, <p>“In-Intruders! Someone has disrupted our ritual! Find them!

Then, I opened my mouth.</p>, <p>“Cut it out, fu*king bastards.”</p>, <p>“Who’s there!”</p>, <p>A typical response granted to villains.</p>, <p>At the same time, the adult parasite shouted.</p>, <p>“To intrude upon our sacred ritual and kill my child! Kill that man!”</p>, <p>Several of the ones outside the pentagram drew their guns.</p>, <p>Guns are still prohibited in our country, so why are there so many of them armed?

Thunk thunk thunk!!!</em></p>, <p>Like pillars of metal arranged around them as if to encircle the parasites.</p>, <p>It was no coincidence, of course.</p>, <p>It was all the result of my control with magnetism.</p>, <p>[Electromagnetic Waves]</p>, <p><em>Fizz, buzzzzz… Fzzzzzzzzzt!!!!</em></p>, <p>The chain of electric shocks I unleashed created a barrier of current as they moved between the pipes.</p>, <p>The creatures were overwhelmed by the curtain of blazing lightning and staggered back.</p>, <p>“Kuh, it’s useless! You cannot stop me, who is blessed with the great will with this mere current!”</p>, <p>The parasite swung its glowing whip again, aiming to destroy the surrounding metal pipes and dispel the barrier of electricity.</p>, <p><em>Boooom—</em></p>, <p><em>Buzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!</em></p>, <p>But things didn’t go as the creature had planned.</p>, <p>The mental whip that struck the power grid became entangled and flailed before….</p>, <p>It vanished.</p>, <p>“Wh-What is this? What… what?! What have you done?”</p>, <p>[Sound Transmission]</p>, <p>I cast a spell to make my voice sound in an unexpected direction.</p>, <p>Now, look over there, not here.</p>, <p>“Ah, didn’t you know? I guess you’re not as old as I thought.”</p>, <p>“Wh-What are you talking about?”</p>, <p>That mental whip had the ridiculous ability to penetrate protective barriers and distortion fields but it had one weakness.</p>, <p>“Your mental whip reacts excessively and becomes uncontrollable when it comes into contact with certain frequencies of electromagnetic waves. Seems like your Mahhsh didn’t tell you that?”</p>, <p>Mahhsh… roughly translates to something like “mother” or “chief” in their language.</p>, <p>A look of horror and panic spread across the adult parasite’s face. Then, in a fit of panic, it snatched a gun from the hand of another parasite beside it and…</p>, <p>“Die, die!! You monster!! Diieeee!!!”</p>, <p><em>Bang! Bang bang! Ratatatatat!!!</em></p>, <p>It fired wildly in the direction of my voice, but I was not there.</p>, <p>“Who’s calling who a monster?”</p>, <p>I activated the [Chains of Domination] and hurled several boxes that were outside.</p>, <p><em>Bang, Crash!</em></p>, <p>Oh, everything inside these boxes turned out to be books. It makes sense since this place was a printing factory dedicated to producing books.</p>, <p>Alright, books should be harmless enough that even Jeong Hyun-ah or Chae Tae-won wouldn’t die if they were accidentaly hit by them.</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p>Using Leap again, I climbed onto a suitable shelf and crouched down, then activated another spell.</p>, <p>[Chains of Domination]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p><em>Chrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!</em></p>, <p>Dozens of golden, shining chains moved in all directions before touching the boxes of books stacked around… and I gave the command.</p>, <p><strong>Fly away.</strong></p>, <p>The sight of hundreds of books soaring towards the expansive fog was nothing short of spectacular, although they were just books after all.</p>, <p>“Aaagh!!”</p>, <p>But those shrouded in the fog, unaware of what was coming at them, screamed in terror as they felt the dull and heavy impact on their bodies. Now, let’s move on to the next step…</p>, <p>“Mage-nim!”</p>, <p>Fortunately, Chae Tae-won acted just in time amidst the chaos. Chae Tae-won who took advantage of the chaos and hid in the fog was carrying Jeong Hyun-ah on his shoulders as he ran.</p>, <p>It was then that the adult parasite finally grasped the situation and screamed.</p>, <p>“Idiots, catch himmmmm!!!”</p>, <p>“Too late.”</p>, <p><em>Bang! Ratatata!</em></p>, <p>Several gun barrels spat fire at Chae Tae-won.</p>, <p>[Chains of Domination]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p>[Great Whirlwind]</p>, <p>But this was somewhat anticipated. I had activated the Chains of Domination a beat earlier and conjured a whirlwind strong enough to lift rocks before hurling hundreds of books once again. The books briefly formed a wall that blocked the bullets, and Chae Tae-won who was carrying Jeong Hyun-ah, disappeared beyond the shelves.</p>, <p>Since he was a smart man, he would surely find a way to escape or secure a safe spot on his own.</p>, <p>Though a few bullets flew my way, I casually redirected them with a distortion field… and leaped once again!</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>, <p>From a distance, I saw the enemies seemingly trapped in a prison made of pure white electricity.</p>, <p><em>Clearly, this one lacks experience.</em></p>, <p>The evil magical power summoned during the previous ritual still lingered, didn’t it?</p>, <p>If they start harnessing that, things could escalate.</p>, <p>Ideally, I’d like to tie them down for interrogation… but eliminating them all before the situation gets worse seems like the best course of action.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>I brought my hands together and started to concentrate my magical power.</p>, <p><em>Ruuumble …!!!</em></p>, <p>Despite being indoors, a deep and thunderous sound reminiscent of storm clouds in the sky started to echo. The source of this noise was the magic circle of lightning spells, wobbling above my hands.</p>, <p><em>Fzzzzt!!</em></p>, <p>The overly condensed lightning magic circle triggered an unexpected phenomenon. Metallic objects within the storage started to be drawn towards my direction.</p>, <p>I twisted the trajectory of the incoming small metal pieces with a distortion field and concentrated even more magical power.</p>, <p>Fizzzzzzzz!!!</p>, <p>Subsequently, the electrical wires in the warehouse that were still carrying electricity overloaded and exploded with white sparks flying around.</p>, <p><em>Creaaaaaak…</em></p>, <p>The metal frames forming the shelves and the steel structures that constituted the framework of the warehouse started to bend toward me.</p>, <p><em>If I gather any more, this place might collapse.</em></p>, <p>But the magical power was already condensed to its limit. I unleashed the writhing, monstrous energy of the lightning that was demanding to be liberated in a concerted burst.</p>, <p>[Lightning Strike]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Crackle, Fizzzzz, Fzzzzzzzzzzzzt!!</em></p>, <p>This was not a simple lightning strike.</p>, <p>The web of currents enveloping the lightning reacted with the freshly unleashed bolts, setting off a chain reaction.</p>, <p>The magic that materialized was a lightning storm of unprecedented scale, unlike anything I had seen before.</p>, <p>The white brilliance of the lightning unfolded with such intensity that it seemed to envelop everything in its path. The vastness of the warehouse shrunk in comparison to the colossal swell of this terrifying storm. It was such a huge flash that it felt like one’s optic nerves would burn just by looking at it.</p>, <p><em>Fizzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!</em></p>, <p>Lightning was a force that couldn’t remain confined to one place. Thus, the huge flashes of electricity disappeared from the warehouse as if they had never occurred.</p>, <p>However, there were clear traces that the thunder dragon I created existed in reality.</p>, <p>A horrifying scene created in less than a tenth of a second that was almost too dreadful to believe.</p>, <p>The shelves were utterly destroyed and reduced to nothing but charred frames, while the books and boxes that had been scattered on the floor bypassed the process of burning and vanished, leaving behind only a trace of ashes.</p>, <p>And the parasites at the heart of this destruction…</p>, <p>Had turned to ash, leaving behind only large chunks of their torsos and heads or a few fragments of their skeletons.</p>, <p>Some even left traces that seemed to pathetically claim that there had been organic matter in the shape of a human being in this place before.</p>, <p><em>Fizzzzzzzzz… Fizzzzzzzzz… Fizz, fizzzzzzz.</em></p>, <p>Even though I had stopped the magic, the shockwaves and electric discharges did not completely die down but continued for a long while.</p>, <p><em>If I had been able to use something like this a long time ago, I could have easily resolved the conflict with Je Mu-gyeong.</em></p>, <p>It wasn’t for nothing that I had poured so much time and energy into deciphering the Silent Scripture of the Dreaming Path. Like absorption, it was a unique magic that could only be acquired through a grimoire.</p>, <p>Without even receiving a buff from an artifact, I was able to effortlessly manifest this powerful magic after endless calculations.</p>, <p>“No, it’s still far from enough.”</p>, <p>The limits of all the abilities and transcendent talent I have were not just this.</p>, <p>I could have triggered an even more powerful attack had I gathered a bit more energy. Moreover, I’m confident that by adding the processes of transformation and enhancement, as I had done before, it might be possible to realize something beyond this.</p>, <p>With more research… there will come a day when I can wield this level of power with a single spell, without resorting to any tricks or shortcuts.</p>, <p>And then, there was one survivor.</p>, <p>“Ughhh…”</p>, <p>A parasite crawling out from among human bodies that have been reduced to ashes.</p>, <p>It appeared to be the leader, the adult parasite. It had indeed possessed more magical power than the others.</p>, <p>Did it maximize its magical resistance and use its subordinates’ bodies as shields at the crucial moment to survive as long as possible?</p>, <p>It seemed futile to emerge… With the host body ceasing to function, perhaps it broke out instinctively?</p>, <p>Nonetheless, the creature was on the brink of death.</p>, <p><em>Even if I wanted to save it now, it’s beyond help.</em></p>, <p>Even though it had been hiding inside a human body, the lightning penetrated flesh and all. The creature was barely managing to twitch, but for a parasite, the nerve ganglia which was its lifeline, were all burned out. It wouldn’t last five minutes before dying even if I just left it be.</p>, <p>Still, might it be capable of a brief conversation?</p>, <p>There’s something I wanted to ask.</p>, <p>“How about it, alien friend? Do you need help?”</p>, <p>“Yes, you… monster… save me… save…”</p>, <p>It kept calling me a monster ever since earlier.</p>, <p>There was no need to get angry. I responded with a kind tone.</p>, <p>“Alright. Unlike you and your kind, I am not a sadist.”</p>, <p>[Exhilaration]</p>, <p>It was a second-order auxiliary magic spell I had also cast on Chae Tae-won.</p>, <p>It wasn’t a healing spell. It was merely meant to invigorate or boost the will to fight.</p>, <p>This magic must have infused a bit of vigor into the parasite’s spirit.</p>, <p>But let me reiterate, I couldn’t save it. It was merely an illusion of healing for a brief moment.</p>, <p>“This magic, this power… it’s impossible… A human wielding such magic… Can’t believe…”</p>, <p>“What do you mean, impossible? You’ve experienced it firsthand, haven’t you?”</p>, <p>“You, are you… really human?”</p>, <p>“Hmm, human, you say? Well…”</p>, <p>I am human. Right now, I am decidedly human.</p>, <p>But… well? Will that remain the case?</p>, <p>As we dive into the latter events of [Cthulhu World], a series of harsh and horrifying incidents will unfold, making it impossible for anyone to confidently claim they are still human.</p>, <p>Knowing the truth beforehand made it difficult for me to confidently claim that I was human.</p>, <p>Regardless, I had no intention of wasting time on pointless chatter.</p>, <p>“I know you creatures don’t just invade any body at will. What were you planning to do with the little girl?”</p>, <p>“Hu… hu… We wanted to… take control… of the Triad…”</p>, <p>“Ah, so Cheong-ho was your ultimate goal.”</p>, <p>Had I not intervened, Jeong Hyun-ah would have become one of the parasites, and eventually, Cheong-ho would have fallen into their hands beyond any hope of salvation.</p>, <p>Good. That brings us to the next matter.</p>, <p>“Seeing that Chae Tae-won doesn’t recognize your kind, it seems the chances of a parasite’s emergence were slim after all. Are you by any chance a First?”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>The creature’s response was barely above a whisper.</p>, <p>“What did you say?”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>“Speak up.”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>I sighed and moved closer to the creature.</p>, <p>It opened its mouth again, but this time, it wasn’t a whisper but a clear loud voice.</p>, <p>“Give me your body!!”</p>, <p>The creature leaped at me with violent force and several hidden tendrils.</p>, <p>But it was a clear and predictable move. I had approached it precisely because I was prepared for such antics.</p>, <p>“Block it.”</p>, <p><em>Swoosh!</em></p>, <p>The lump of flesh that was hidden nearby flew towards me and latched onto the parasite that was charging at me.</p>, <p>“Arghhh!! What… what is this?!”</p>, <p>“That’s a gift from the [Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young].”</p>, <p>“Lies! All lies! The [All-Mother] would never lend her power to someone like you!”</p>, <p>“Sure, you’re right. Think what you will.”</p>, <p>The flesh began to consume the creature in a manner similar to how it had devoured the young parasite before. More precisely, it was assimilation. While the creature’s knowledge would be lost, some of its power and genetic information would merge with and be preserved within the lump of flesh.</p>, <p>“Ah, what a shame. It would have been nice to know if it was a First.”</p>, <p>That information was unexpectedly provided in another way.</p>, <p>[Achievement unlocked! You have foiled the Parasite’s (First) plot.</p>, <p>You have earned the ‘Advanced Achievement: Reconnaissance’.</p>, <p>As a reward for the achievement, you receive the ‘Body Snatcher’s Necklace’ and additional experience points.]</p>, <p>“Parasite, marked as a First…”</p>, <p>The situation was amusing but the information was valuable.</p>, <p>And that statement implied I would hardly ever encounter another parasite again.</p>, <p>This was because the title ‘First’ was reserved for the entity that first infiltrated a specific planet.</p>, <p>If a First reproduced and its offspring formed a new colony independently, those offspring would be called Seconds, much like how colonies of bees or ants expand.</p>, <p>Should the offspring of a Second create another new colony, they would be known as Thirds, and beyond that point, the generations would spread too rapidly for the distinction to matter.</p>, <p>This was the trigger for one of [Cthulhu World]’s major branches, the [Parasite War].</p>, <p>It meant engaging in endless battles against societies dominated by parasites. While the parasites themselves weren’t tough enemies, the branch was particularly exhausting because you had to suspect and scrutinize the NPCs you encountered for signs of parasitic infection.</p>, <p>Nonetheless, the existence of only one First wasn’t guaranteed, so I couldn’t let my guard down completely, but it felt like a significant threat had been averted.</p>, <p>And there was one more thing. The fact that this creature was a First held significant importance.</p>, <p>[Please check the corpse of the parasite to claim your achievement reward.]</p>, <p>Yes, the reward for that achievement.</p>, <p>It was an artifact that could only be obtained by capturing a First.</p>, <p>But, the corpse of a parasite?</p>, <p>“Hey, where did you two go? Come here.”</p>, <p><em>Squelch, squish, squish…</em></p>, <p>The two lumps of flesh squirmed and crawled out from a corner of the warehouse.</p>, <p>Both had stuffed themselves to the point of bursting, resulting in them growing slightly larger than before. Each one was now the size of what they had been when they were still a single mass.</p>, <p>“Which one of you is it? I don’t mind if you eat the meat, but hand over the foreign objects to me.”</p>, <p>For a moment, they writhed as if dancing, and then one of them regurgitated a small pendant.</p>, <p>At first glance, it appeared to be a metal piece smaller than a thumb with a design that looked like a quince. When I picked it up for a closer look, it shimmered with a mystical luster that no metal on Earth could produce, as if made from semi-transparent particles of a mysterious color.</p>, <p>Pulling on its end, the metal piece stretched out into a thin and flexible loop that could be worn around the neck.</p>, <p>[Body Snatcher’s Necklace (S-rank Accessory): A special accessory that contains alien technology. It contains various records stored while traveling between stars, but research is necessary to access this information.</p>, <p>Thoughts Domination: Allows the use of the unique ability [Mental Whip]. However, each use of this effect will erode your mind with the necklace’s recorded resentments.</p>, <p>Enhanced Mind: Mental Strength +2]</p>, <p>It was an artifact that granted the ability to use [Mental Whip] which was a unique skill only usable by adult parasites.</p>, <p>Moreover, it boosted mental strength by +2.</p>, <p>With this equipped, there would be little need to worry about mental strength at my current level.</p>, <p>But more importantly, this was a kind of grimoire in the form of a necklace. It wasn’t a book per se and thus required some preparatory work, but it was an original grimoire, not a degraded translation produced on Earth. Success in deciphering it could lead to exponential progress.</p>, <p>It was indeed a fortunate find. Such items rarely appear this early, but this one had unexpectedly emerged tied to the quest involving Cheongho’s daughter, so I was able to catch it easily.</p>, <p>This time, I happened to be able to swoop in at just the right time, so I was able to fight on my own terms…..Typically, these creatures infiltrate the political or financial elite and start crafting petty conspiracies or laying cunning traps.</p>, <p>Fighting them on their terms often leads to infuriating complications.</p>, <p>Such as having a bounty placed on your head or having your accounts and property seized…</p>, <p>“Phew… I’m just relieved to have avoided such a fate.”</p>, <p>But there were more gains to be had.</p>, <p>Among the ashes of their burned bodies, I found magic stones and various small artifacts. Nothing of remarkable quality, but among them were a few noteworthy items:</p>, <p>[Brainwave Stone (B-rank Catalyst): A stone emitting wavelengths similar to human brainwaves. It enhances abilities based on mental magic or psychic powers…]</p>, <p>[Moon Shard (A-rank Magical Tool): A magical tool crafted from moonstone. It possesses the power to ward off certain extraterrestrial monsters…]</p>, <p>[Physical Enhancement Coating (B-rank Consumable): A special device made with alien technology. When used, it releases a strengthening mucus that temporarily fortifies the skin…]</p>, <p>There was no need to examine the data of every minor artifact in detail.</p>, <p>I briefly checked the essential information and tidied things up accordingly.</p>, <p><em>Many were damaged due to being scorched by electricity, but this is a decent way to earn some pocket money.</em></p>, <p>Wait a minute… Isn’t there still something left?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>A dark purple magical power lingered over the scorched and ravaged earth.</p>, <p>It was an otherworldly magical power that they had summoned through the ritual.</p>, <p>Normally, the moment I would have intervened and disrupted the ritual, this magical power would have scattered in all directions, but it stubbornly clung to the land still.</p>, <p>It must have originated from a being of no ordinary stature.</p>, <p><em>Isn’t it said that one should serve in the household of a great lord?</em></p>, <p>A being that exists at the very origin of the universe.</p>, <p>The most ancient and pure entity born from the chaos bubbling up from the deepest abyss.</p>, <p>Merely uttering his name would curse one with a formless evil.</p>, <p>The [Blind Idiot God]</p>, <p>An odd moniker for an entity of a final boss caliber.</p>, <p><em>But it can’t be helped. After all, he’s more of a concept or a law than a deity with will.</em></p>, <p>Thus, borrowing his power isn’t as difficult as one might think.</p>, <p>But unless you are an alien race born with a special body or mind, it is impossible to control that power…</p>, <p>Even I don’t know how to disperse this profound and mighty magical power.</p>, <p>Of course, there existed a spell called [Power Expulsion] capable of driving out the influence of outer gods and such, but it was merely a basic spell with clear limitations.</p>, <p><em>I might learn something more advanced through the grimoire later on…. but basic magic won’t cut it.</em></p>, <p>But then again, what if I didn’t disperse it? Could there be a way to absorb and control it, or perhaps store it somewhere?</p>, <p>Indeed, there was a way.</p>, <p>The lumps of flesh that still writhed beside me, these were magical creatures I had temporarily conjured with my own magic, with but a short lifespan. What would happen if I fed this magical power to them?</p>, <p>Due to the interruption of the ritual, the remaining magical power’s density was quite low.</p>, <p>Compared to the main body’s magical power, it was merely a minuscule aftermath, but… if I managed to harness it, I could use it in many ways.</p>, <p><em>The lumps of flesh I’ve been nurturing might be ruined, but then again, they weren’t meant to last long anyway….</em></p>, <p>This wasn’t my first time attempting such a feat.</p>, <p>I had some theoretical knowledge from trying similar things a few times in the game, though back then, there were specialized magical tools or specific traits suited for the task. It wasn’t easy.</p>, <p>But on the flip side, it meant that this wasn’t as difficult as turning Lee Chang-hyeok, who had become a lower-level mutant, back into a human.</p>, <p>Still, safety measures were necessary.</p>, <p>Fortunately, amidst all that chaos, the magic circles and traces of the ritual left by the parasites remained. I placed the magic stones produced by the parasites around the area to resurrect their ritual.</p>, <p>I then commanded the lumps of flesh to merge into one and activated several magic circles.</p>, <p>In an instant, the warehouse was filled with colorful magic circles.</p>, <p>The parasites’ magic circles and these would serve as a safety measure.</p>, <p>[Power Expulsion]</p>, <p>The spell wasn’t cast to scatter the gathered magical power.</p>, <p>It was too dense and concentrated for me to manipulate or absorb it, so I needed to weaken its power.</p>, <p><em>Hisssssss….</em></p>, <p>My magical power was overlaid on the magical power of a great being.</p>, <p>The magic circles burst into light simultaneously.</p>, <p>[Evil Gaze]</p>, <p>I invoked the Evil Gaze to enforce my influence on the evil being.</p>, <p>Though the direction was slightly different and there were compatibility issues, I manually adjusted each one to convert it into the form I needed right now.</p>, <p>The magical power I sought to control was now pure power itself which has already lost its will or direction.</p>, <p>Hear my command.</p>, <p>From now on, I am your master.</p>, <p><em>Uuuuuuuuuu….</em></p>, <p>The purple magical power began to swirl tumultuously.</p>, <p>Good, it’s working.</p>, <p>I raised the butcher’s hook I held in my hand.</p>, <p>[Absorption]</p>, <p><em>Whooooooooooo….</em></p>, <p>The otherworldly magical power that pooled around me transformed into a swirling vortex and it passed through the many layers of magic circles I had created.</p>, <p>The power flowing like a massive ring slowly shifted and was then absorbed by the butcher’s hook in my hand.</p>, <p>“It’s incredibly… heavy…”</p>, <p>Since before humanity walked the Earth, the parasites worshipped the [Blind Idiot God].</p>, <p>They possessed a unique trait that allowed them to receive this magical power.</p>, <p>Thus, they have used this heavy magic for their reproductive activities. However, I lack such traits. I must proceed with this task solely through my control and sensitivity to magical power.</p>, <p>[The presence of the Great Being shakes your mind. If you cannot withstand its influence… you will become a completely different person than you were before.]</p>, <p>[Attempting to resist the distortion with your mental strength stat. Mental strength check…failed]</p>, <p>This must have been a particularly difficult challenge.</p>, <p>It would have been a guaranteed failure under normal circumstances.</p>, <p><em>Crackllllle!!

It was a violent reaction that was quite different from usual.</p>, <p>[System: The unique trait ‘Madness of the Abyss’ has been activated. The result of the sanity check has been changed to success.]</p>, <p>Despite my complaints… “Madness of the Abyss” was truly an overpowered trait. It completely overturned the fundamental principles that made up the difficulty of [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>I succeeded. Somehow, I was able to gather and control the magic power around here. If I wished, I could use this power to create cataclysmic destruction or perform miracles strong enough to shake the very laws of physics.</p>, <p><em>But I have no immediate use for it.</em></p>, <p>In any case, I needed a place to store this energy.</p>, <p>Coincidentally, I had such a place. A lump of flesh that absorbs the bodies of parasites, their genetic information, magical power, and their unique traits.</p>, <p>There was a good chance it could develop an organ or trait to accept the magical power of the [Blind Idiot God].</p>, <p>I began to break down the concentrated magical power and slowly infuse it into the lump of flesh.</p>, <p>The lump of flesh started to decompose as it absorbed new life and magical power.</p>, <p>It transformed into the very essence of flowing magical power, becoming a froth of scattering light, and then… it transformed into a physical form.</p>, <p>It was… a small egg, no bigger than a palm.</p>, <p>“An egg?”</p>, <p>Upon closer inspection, it wasn’t accurate to simply call it an egg.</p>, <p>It was a small mass that seemed to be made of tangled and compressed human body parts. A bizarre object with the shape of a small, egg-like body, embossed with wrinkled and intertwined human forms.</p>, <p>And it was a small creature with a warm body temperature—a small egg filled with immense potential.</p>, <p>…It may have been a grandiose explanation, but it ultimately was an egg.</p>, <p>Is this the first time I’ve created something like this?</p>, <p>No message window popped up either. What exactly have I made?</p>, <p>…I’m not sure.</p>, <p>I resolved to conduct a thorough investigation once I returned home.</p>, <p>“Is this the end, then?”</p>, <p>It was time to head back.</p>, <p>When I emerged from the warehouse, I found Chae Tae-won waiting for me outside.</p>, <p>“Where is the young lady?”</p>, <p>“She’s in the car.”</p>, <p>Chae Tae-won replied with a worried look on his face.</p>, <p>When I looked inside the car, I saw Jeong Hyun-ah sitting in the back seat. And then I was able to understand why Chae Tae-won was making that expression soon after checking her condition.</p>, <p>Jeong Hyun-ah was still staring blankly into space. In other words, the hypnosis hadn’t worn off yet.</p>, <p>“Oh, that’s nothing serious.”</p>, <p>“Is there any way you could help?”</p>, <p>There were numerous ways to wake her, but that wouldn’t be very dramatic.</p>, <p>“It’s a bit difficult to do it here. Let’s return to the chairman for now. There might be safer alternatives once we’re in a more stable environment.”</p>, <p>“Um… alright.”</p>, <p>It wasn’t a condition that was harmful to the body anyway. It was as if she was in a deep sleep, so letting her rest for another 30 minutes wouldn’t be an issue. Jeong Hyun-ah was to be awakened in front of Cheong-ho.</p>, <p>Thus, we made our way back to Cheong-ho’s country house on the outskirts of Paju.</p>, <p>Yang Seo-ho and the police were still in a standoff with the members of the Triad. It seemed there had been a few physical collisions in our absence, as both sides appeared drained.</p>, <p>Yang Seo-ho, however, was still full of vigor. Amidst the chaos, when everyone else was on the brink of collapse, only she continued to shout resolutely.</p>, <p>“Ah, Cheong-ho-sshi! Let’s just give up now!!! Do you think I’m doing this for fun?!!!”</p>, <p>If Yang Seo-ho had truly decided to use force, the confrontation would have been over in less than five minutes and the other side wouldn’t have been able to hold on until now. No, is that all she could do? She could have destroyed Cheong-ho’s entire house if she’d been so inclined.</p>, <p>Regardless of whether they were gangsters or not, as long as the other party was South Korean citizens, they were ultimately under Yang Seo-ho’s protection.</p>, <p>Into this tumultuous scene stepped Chae Tae-won.</p>, <p>“The young lady has returned! Please, stand down now!”</p>, <p>Upon hearing Chae Tae-won’s words, Yang Seo-ho cocked her head momentarily before pointing the loudspeaker at him and shouting.</p>, <p>“What did you say?!!!”</p>, <p>A ringing shockwave ensued. It even made the car windows vibrate.</p>, <p>Hit directly by the shockwave, Chae Tae-won grimaced and faltered slightly but maintained his dignified composure.</p>, <p>“The situation has concluded. The young lady has returned, and we no longer require your services.”</p>, <p>Yang Seo-ho turned her head indifferently toward the direction of the car, where Jung Hyun-ah and I were sitting.</p>, <p>“Ah, I see. Who is that in the car? Can I take a closer look?”</p>, <p>“That’s not possible.”</p>, <p>“Really?”</p>, <p>Yang Seo-ho frowned and scratched her chin. It was a scary sight. While I understood Chae Tae-won’s stance, it wasn’t the wisest decision.</p>, <p>This was merely creating a new stalemate. Aah, this can’t go on… Before she could begin to exert her real power, I activated the same magic that had deceived Yang Seo-ho once before.</p>, <p>[Tangled Identity]</p>, <p>[Hazy Presence]</p>, <p>[Kind Whisper]</p>, <p>An illusion that superimposed the face of another person over a mask was cast. Once the magical illusion settled, an unfamiliar face appeared in the car’s rearview mirror.</p>, <p>An utterly nondescript face that no amount of searching could attribute any distinctive features to, and a face with a vague image that was specially tuned and made through magic. In that state, I got out of the car with the hood of my hoodie pulled over my head.</p>, <p>“What’s that now?”</p>, <p>“Inspector-nim, perhaps it’s time for you to leave?”</p>, <p>“Why should I?”</p>, <p>“The fact that we saved the young lady means that we have subdued the kidnappers who kidnapped the young lady.”</p>, <p>“Where are they now?”</p>, <p>“They’re in a warehouse near the old publishing district. If you step back, I’ll give you the exact address.”</p>, <p>“Tell me now.”</p>, <p>“Will you step back then?”</p>, <p>Yang Seo-ho furrowed her brow again and then shouted to the police officers behind her.</p>, <p>“Fortunately!! It looks like our beloved daughter of the great Republic of Korea has returned safely!!! Let’s all applaud this joyous occasion and withdraw!!!!”</p>, <p><em>Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.</em></p>, <p>Seeing the police start clapping with grim faces almost brought tears to my eyes. It’s heartbreaking to see the guardians of the people, the sticks of the public, suffering under this crazy woman….</p>, <p>Only after confirming that the police were starting to withdraw did I give Yang Seo-ho the address.</p>, <p>“I’m really busy and have to leave today as well… but I won’t let it slide a third time. There will be consequences.”</p>, <p>Yang Seo-ho left after spouting a strange mix of formal and informal speech and threats.</p>, <p>From the mention of “a third time” it seems the threat is directed at me rather than Cheong-ho.</p>, <p>“Well, do as you please.”</p>, <p>It’s not like we’ll see each other again.</p>, <p>…. But it might be better to create a different face just in case we do meet again.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The scary Yang Seo-ho and the police retreated.</p>, <p>And Cheong-ho’s daughter, Jeong Hyeon-ah, who had been kidnapped returned to her home.</p>, <p>“Fixer-nim! Mage-nim! Kim Shin-hwa-nim!”</p>, <p>Those were the words Cheong-ho exclaimed the moment he saw his daughter’s face again, a face he might have never seen again. Cheong-ho expressed his gratitude while clinging to me with almost tearful fervor.</p>, <p>“Ah… thank you! Truly, thank you!”</p>, <p>He lost all semblance of his boss-like demeanor and thanked me, someone barely half his age.</p>, <p>Cheong-ho seemed to think that there were no more problems to deal with, but there was still one issue left unresolved.</p>, <p>The powerful hypnosis caused by the parasites’ unique abilities still trapped Jeong Hyeon-ah’s mind, and she was frozen in a state where she could not express any emotions or thoughts.</p>, <p>After seeing that, Cheong-ho turned pale again. Regardless of how his subordinates were looking at him, he was anxious and unable to hug or even touch Jeong Hyeon-ah.</p>, <p>“Hyeon-ah? Hyeon-ah? What’s this? What have those fu*king bastards done to my child!!”</p>, <p>The question was naturally directed at me. It seemed that in Cheong-ho’s mind, I must have become a divine being capable of solving all problems.</p>, <p>“She’s under hypnosis. I checked on the way here, and apart from a few injuries, her body is in good shape.”</p>, <p>Despite my explanation, Cheong-ho continued to mutter anxiously about what to do next.</p>, <p>“Hypnosis? What, like the mind control hypnosis? That kind of thing? Those fu*king bastards!”</p>, <p>“We’ll need a quiet place. How about we go inside?”</p>, <p>Eventually, Jeong Hyeon-ah was carried into Cheong-ho’s mansion on a stretcher.</p>, <p>The mansion was bustling with his underlings and employees.</p>, <p>However, as the situation became tense, figures who appeared to be leaders within the Triad started to clear the underlings and employees out of the area.</p>, <p>When Jeong Hyeon-ah was brought into the mansion, a message popped up announcing the completion of the quest.</p>, <p>[You have managed to rescue the daughter of Cheong-ho, one of the three leaders of the Triad, which rules over the underworld of Paju. Had you been even slightly delayed, a horrific alien parasite might have burrowed into this young child’s brain. Cheong-ho who had asked for your help now holds you in high regard. Cheong-ho will become your friendly ally in the future and help you with your future endeavors.]</p>, <p>Ah, it seems waking her from the hypnosis wasn’t part of the requirements.</p>, <p>Delivering Jeong Hyeon-ah safely inside the house was the condition for completing the quest.</p>, <p>Jeong Hyeon-ah’s condition didn’t matter. Even if she had been a corpse or parasitized by a parasite, it would have been resolved just the same.</p>, <p>Of course, if that had happened, it would have resulted in a madness-filled narrative typical of [Cthulhu world].</p>, <p>It’s a good thing I acted quickly.</p>, <p>[You have rescued Jeong Hyeon-ah. Experience points gained.]</p>, <p>Right, let’s see the rewards.</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>[You have defeated ‘Parasite – Larvae’ (31). Your understanding of parasites in general has increased.]</p>, <p>[You have defeated ‘Parasite – Adult’. Your understanding of parasites in general has significantly increased.]</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>[Discovery: You have acquired a secret item (1) from the laboratory. Experience points gained.]</p>, <p>[Discovery: You have found a secret space used by the parasites. Experience points gained.]</p>, <p>[Experience Bonus: You have achieved a total of (2) achievements.]</p>, <p>[You have accumulated enough experience points to advance to the next level. Your level increases by 1.]</p>, <p>I am now at level 28. Probably by the time I finish the next quest, I’ll be over level 30, and then I’ll be able to use third-order magic in earnest.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim!”</p>, <p>“Ah, yes.”</p>, <p>“Why are you zoning out in a situation like this …”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho looked at me with a pitiful expression. I had brought her here for a dramatic effect, but seeing the normally fierce-looking Cheong-ho distort his features like this was more uncomfortable to witness than I had expected. I think it is time to resolve this situation.</p>, <p>It seemed like Cheong-ho’s employees were cleaning up the messy house, but the windows in Jeong Hyeon-ah’s room were completely destroyed. It was not easy to repair such damage in such a short period of time, so Jeong Hyeon-ah had been moved to another room on the second floor. The lack of elaborate decorations or furniture meant it was a guest room.</p>, <p>I decided to check on Jeong Hyeon-ah’s condition more thoroughly. Although I had already checked once in the car on our way back, it was important to prepare for any unforeseen changes.</p>, <p>[Insight]</p>, <p><em>Kiiiiing…</em></p>, <p>The magic I used to check her condition revealed no special issues. Had this been a problem induced by sheer madness, the situation would have been much more complicated, but as it stood, a sufficient level of stimulation could potentially awaken her.</p>, <p>For example, a somewhat stronger electric shock might do the trick. But that wouldn’t be a good thing to do, would it?</p>, <p>Well, there were other ways to awaken her without resorting to that.</p>, <p>I activated a spell while placing my hand on the forehead of Jeong Hyeon-ah, who lay in bed staring into the void.</p>, <p>First, physical activation.</p>, <p>[Exhilaration]</p>, <p>Elevation was proving to be quite versatile today. It came with the effect of boosting the will to fight and was beneficial for vitality enhancement. It was good for vigor and would certainly stimulate the secretion of adrenaline.</p>, <p>And then… well, at times like this, this is simply the best option.</p>, <p>[Voice of Authority]</p>, <p>It was a spell capable of delivering a definitive stimulation to the consciousness of sentient beings. I could manipulate others by imbuing my voice with a surreal authority.</p>, <p><strong>Jeong Hyeon-ah, come to your senses.</strong></p>, <p>“Ah…!”</p>, <p>Suddenly, color returned to Jeong Hyeon-ah’s face as she took a deep breath. Then, as if awakening from a nightmare, she abruptly sat up.</p>, <p>At the same moment, Cheong-ho’s cry burst forth.</p>, <p>“Hyeon-ah!!!”</p>, <p>“Da-Dad?!”</p>, <p>It was a touching father-daughter reunion. I stepped back to allow Cheong-ho to savor the joy, but that movement inadvertently caught Jeong Hyeon-ah’s attention.</p>, <p>Unconsciously, her gaze shifted in my direction, and our eyes met through the mask I wore. Of course, I couldn’t tell which of the four eyes on the mask she looked into. What was certain, however, was that the sight of me shocked Jeong Hyeon-ah.</p>, <p>“Aaaahhh!!!”</p>, <p>“Hyeon-ah! Hyeon-ah!! What’s wrong!?”</p>, <p>“Monster! Monster!! Grim Reaper!!!”</p>, <p>“What’s happening!!!”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho’s subordinates stormed in with the force that threatened to break down the door.</p>, <p>The daughter’s screams, the father’s cries.</p>, <p>…This turned out to be the worst possible father-daughter reunion.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Calming the chaos and unraveling the misunderstandings turned out to be more difficult than anticipated.</p>, <p>Since I was at the heart of the problem, I inevitably found myself kicked out of Jeong Hyeon-ah’s room for a while and came down to the living room where Cheong-ho had previously made a mess.</p>, <p>The employees and the henchmen of the Triad had worked hard to clean up the room during the two hours or so I had left to rescue Jeong Hyeon-ah, so the living room was in an acceptable condition.</p>, <p>The absence of the shattered ornaments inevitably left the space feeling emptier.</p>, <p>Just when I started to get bored from sitting in the living room, Jeong Hyeon-ah and Cheong-ho came downstairs.</p>, <p>From a distance, Jeong Hyeon-ah seemed startled at the sight of me, but after realizing that the object obscuring my face was merely a mask and not my actual face, she approached me.</p>, <p>Still, it seemed she had no intention of coming closer than 2 meters.</p>, <p>With her head bowed, Jeong Hyeon-ah fumbled for words before finally managing to express herself clearly.</p>, <p>“Thank … thank you…”</p>, <p>Fortunately, it was a word of gratitude.</p>, <p>“Yes, I’m just glad you’re safe.”</p>, <p>Hearing a normal voice come from me, Jeong Hyeon-ah appeared somewhat reassured. But that was as far as it went. Eventually, Cheong-ho intervened.</p>, <p>“Ah, she’s not usually like this, but she’s had a tough day… It might be best for her to rest now. Hyeon-ah, you’ve been through enough; go on up.”</p>, <p>“Ah, yes. I think that would be better.”</p>, <p>With that, Jeong Hyeon-ah disappeared back upstairs.</p>, <p>She was someone I wouldn’t see again anyway.</p>, <p>In [Cthulhu World], a high school girl without any special abilities could only become a victim of surreal disasters, just as it happened this time. After receiving thanks, it would be better for both of us to never meet again.</p>, <p>Instead, it was more important to engage in conversation with Cheong-ho, who could offer practical rewards.</p>, <p>“I’m not sure if repeating it over and over again has made it sound less heavy, but I want to say it once more.”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho, who was finally beginning to reclaim his image as one of the three heads of the underworld ruling triad, spoke in a serious tone.</p>, <p>“Thank you very much for saving my daughter.”</p>, <p>“Yes, I’m glad everything was resolved safely.”</p>, <p>[Achievement Unlocked! You have saved Cheong-ho’s daughter and received his heartfelt gratitude.</p>, <p>You have earned the ‘General Achievement: Tiger in Debt’.</p>, <p>As a reward for this achievement, you will have a firm alliance with ‘Cheong-ho’, one of the three heads of the triad.]</p>, <p>“Wherever you are and whatever you do, you will be treated as a benefactor of the triad from now on.”</p>, <p>I don’t believe those words. To be precise, I would be a benefactor to only one-third of the triad.</p>, <p>“That’s very kind of you.”</p>, <p>“And about the compensation initially proposed through the broker…”</p>, <p>The initial compensation I was promised from Tudor was three hundred million. There was no official announcement, but a message popped up indicating that a bonus would be added based on performance.</p>, <p>“I’ve been thinking, and it seems I offered you too little compensation. So, I was wondering if there’s anything else you might need? I’m even willing to double the amount if necessary.”</p>, <p>Six hundred million. More money is always better. But I had a different goal in mind.</p>, <p>I spoke slowly.</p>, <p>“Could I possibly ask for something other than money?”</p>, <p>“What might that be? I’ll help with whatever I can, as long as it’s within my power.”</p>, <p>Though he said this, Cheong-ho’s expression sharpened curiously. He seemed to sense that I wasn’t going to ask for a typical reward. Or perhaps he thought this situation might evolve into some sort of deal or negotiation.</p>, <p>Regardless of what he was thinking, I felt more at ease now, as if I was finally having a real conversation with someone. So, I broached the same topic I had with Tudor.</p>, <p>“I’m searching for a grimoire.”</p>, <p>“A grimoire? Is there a specific one you’re looking for?”</p>, <p>“No, I’m not looking for a specific book. I’m in search of a particular type of book.”</p>, <p>“It doesn’t sound like an ordinary grimoire, then.”</p>, <p>“I’m looking for books related to the beings of the abyss, the old great ones, or the masters of other worlds.”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho didn’t respond immediately. Instead, he covered his face with his hands. He looked like he was deep in thought, but the corners of his mouth that could be seen between his fingers were smiling.</p>, <p>“That’s interesting. May I ask why you’re looking for such things?”</p>, <p>“I am a mage before I am a fixer. Would it suffice to say that I seek to satisfy my curiosity as a mage?”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho then leaned back into the sofa and smiled openly. It seemed he took my words as a polite lie, which was to be expected.</p>, <p>“In this line of work, one comes across all sorts of items. I happen to have come across one such grimoire by chance.”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho possesses a grimoire?</p>, <p>This was news to me. Yet, this revelation didn’t make me think the game’s narrative had changed, unlike other instances. With such detailed information, it’s possible there were things I hadn’t come across. Some artifacts, after all, have a tendency to appear in random locations.</p>, <p>“Would you be willing to part with it? Even a temporary loan would be good for me.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“The value of an item varies from person to person. To me, its value lies solely in being an antique, so I am willing to transfer it to you.”</p>, <p>“Thank you.”</p>, <p>“However, it’s not possible at this very moment.”</p>, <p>I waited silently for Cheong-ho’s next words.</p>, <p>“It’s not for any other reason but that the item is stored in the main house’s warehouse. Since it’s in a different region, could you wait a bit?”</p>, <p>This sounded like a lie. Yet, Cheong-ho didn’t seem the type to joke around with non-existent items. Though not certain, I couldn’t help but wonder if Cheong-ho was using the book as a pretext to meet me again.</p>, <p>“There’s no rush, so that’s fine. If you happen to come across any information related to such grimoires elsewhere, I’d appreciate a heads-up.”</p>, <p>“Ha! I’d be more than happy to help with that. Is there anything else you need? Perhaps access to a black market where you might find grimoires … Yes, how about that? I could help you get in.”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho’s efforts to win my favor were almost touching.</p>, <p>“If that’s possible, I’d like to ask for your help with that as well.”</p>, <p>“Heh… It might be difficult right away, but I’ll arrange something good before long.”</p>, <p>“Thank you.”</p>, <p>“But Mage-nim, your name was Kim Shin-hwa, right?”</p>, <p>“Yes.”</p>, <p>“You may think this is out of the blue but may I make a proposal?”</p>, <p>“A proposal?”</p>, <p>“Not something like access to the black market, but rather, how about working together with me?”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>“Mages are often seen as slow, expensive, shady, and even unlucky and arrogant. Oh, my apologies. I mean other Mages. But Kim Shin-hwa-nim is different. You possess remarkable skills and are both agile and trustworthy.”</p>, <p>“Um…”</p>, <p>“The name ‘Triad’ might sound grand, but in reality, it’s nothing special. Back then, the times were so dangerous and chaotic… it was possible to forcibly unite things that shouldn’t be mixed. But it’s not like that anymore, right? In Paju, which is slowly finding peace, the name ‘Triad’ has become not a shield but an uncomfortable shackle.”</p>, <p>Surprisingly, Cheong-ho spoke of the division within Triad. I wasn’t surprised because it wasn’t my first time hearing this. I’ve encountered this event several times before. However, there were conditions for this event to happen.</p>, <p>First, you must form a firm alliance with one of the three heads of the Triad.</p>, <p>Second, the player’s level must be 50 or above.</p>, <p>My level is currently 28. Why has this event suddenly occurred? Does this imply my abilities are now equivalent to those at level 50?</p>, <p>Considering the abilities I possessed and the enemies I could challenge, it seemed plausible that I could be around that level. But it felt premature. And above all…</p>, <p>“The reason we’ve been hesitant to make a move is because there are two of them. The other two must be thinking the same. I can deal with either one, but I can’t deal with both at the same time. However, with Kim Shin-hwa-nim by our side, I believe we can even take on three, not just two. What do you say? I’ll offer you the best treatment I can.”</p>, <p>“Thank you for your offer, but I have no intention of joining any organization or group for the time being.”</p>, <p>I had no desire to fall under Cheong-ho’s command.</p>, <p>Nor was I interested in any other factions within the Triad. While the human resources and underworld infrastructure of the Triad were appealing, those were merely on a human level.</p>, <p>This was evident even in the case of Chae Tae-won, a senior figure in the Triad. His character and abilities were respectable, but they were still within human limits. Even compared to Curtain Call, who was no different from a wild caveman, Chae Tae-won was far behind.</p>, <p>The entities I would face in the future were beyond human capabilities, and compared to those monsters, the Triad’s minions were nothing more than a swarm of ants.</p>, <p>“Is that so… Well…”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho wore a bitter expression on his face. He seemed to think it was because he showed too much desperation. But that wasn’t entirely incorrect, so I didn’t bother to correct his thought.</p>, <p>“And this is a piece of advice, separate from your proposal…”</p>, <p>“Advice?”</p>, <p>“Don’t think that Paju is now at peace.”</p>, <p>“What? What do you mean?”</p>, <p>Finally, the honorifics disappeared from Cheong-ho’s speech. It wasn’t that his attitude had changed because I had rejected his offer. Rather, he was so taken aback that he couldn’t maintain his formal tone.</p>, <p>“It may sound like a prophecy, but soon, an issue unlike any before will not just affect Paju but the entire world. For that time, whether to keep the Triad going or…”</p>, <p>If you want to fight, move faster than anyone else. I didn’t explicitly say it, but it seemed Cheong-ho had caught on to what I was implying without me having to state it outright.</p>, <p>“But with the current forces at my disposal…”</p>, <p>“I will continue to work solely through Vasilisa for the time being. If the conditions are right, I might come to greet you again.”</p>, <p>“I understand… Alright… A grimoire? Fine. I can procure as many of those as you need.”</p>, <p>Cheong-ho made a bold claim, but it was merely a boast since he was almost as ignorant about grimoires as anyone else. Should he truly start to search, he’d realize the difficulty of acquiring one and likely be shocked.</p>, <p>The conversation that followed my refusal of the collaboration offer was hardly important. Perhaps unable to let go completely, Cheong-ho brought up the topic of his grimoire several more times. It wasn’t until I promised to meet in person again on the day he would deliver the grimoire that I was finally able to leave.</p>, <p><em>**</em><em>*</em></p>, <p>Two more weeks passed.</p>, <p>There was no word from Cheong-ho, who had promised to deliver the grimoire.</p>, <p>Instead, I received a compensation of three hundred million won through Tudor.</p>, <p>Setting aside everything else, the fact that Cheong-ho and I had become firm allies hadn’t changed, so I decided to wait for him without any sense of urgency. Anyway, he won’t betray me if nothing out of the ordinary happens.</p>, <p>In the meantime, I kept myself busy by resolving a few requests.</p>, <p>They were mostly jobs that paid pocket money. I captured a few wanted criminals, covertly blew up a mercenary group’s base that had upset a major corporation, and stole a cherished idol from a cult’s sacred site.</p>, <p>The last quest I undertook was particularly significant.</p>, <p>In the process of stealing the idol, I managed to sweep up all the relics they had gathered.</p>, <p>While none of the items were immediately usable, I ended up with a bounty of versatile catalysts and materials that could be used for various purposes.</p>, <p>“Phew… It’s about time I got a proper workshop or research space.”</p>, <p>Or more accurately, what I needed was a warehouse. Warehouse! The small studio apartment I had was far too cramped for all the items I had accumulated.</p>, <p>Now, there were cursed fake gold turning black, fragments of bizarre creatures, magical tools, various catalysts, and shimmering magic stones, not to mention a golden dancer’s head displayed in one corner as if it were a piece of decor.</p>, <p>The items here alone could build a decent alchemy workshop if I take good care of them.</p>, <p>“Whatever it is, this isn’t the place for it.”</p>, <p>Of course, I had conducted some limited work and magical experiments here, but even that was reaching its limits.</p>, <p>As time passed, both my collection of items and my wealth grew significantly. At the same time, my reliability with Tudor and my reputation as a fixer had solidified which paved the way for more dangerous quests to come my way.</p>, <p>Furthermore, if I were to advance further in this line of work, my reputation as a fixer could very well develop into notoriety. That would certainly bring about exciting times; I’d become a wanted man, with bounty hunters and assassins trailing me.</p>, <p>Taking all of this into account led me to a simple conclusion.</p>, <p>“It’s about time I moved my base of operations.”</p>, <p>With the money at my disposal and Tudor’s cooperation, securing a safehouse-level residence wouldn’t be a difficult task.</p>, <p>However, I needed a place that was more spacious than what could typically be acquired through such means.</p>, <p>Ideally, a residence with unique features that would benefit its occupant would be preferable.</p>, <p>Should I go for [Home Usurpation]?</p>, <p>If I wanted to, I could easily kill an easy NPC and take over his house. Although it’s an outrageous crime, it’s a brilliant system that reflects the ruthless nature of the [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>But I need to choose carefully. The better the house, the more likely it was to have formidable defenses or a highly capable owner. Moreover, the closer to the city center, the higher the chances of getting caught by the police or even the immigration bureau…</p>, <p><em>Tsk, how did it come to this?</em></p>, <p>Despite justifying it as part of the game’s system, what I was thinking about was essentially murder and theft. If I were still living in the real world as Kim Shin-hwa, I would never even consider such things, let alone carry out such a plan.</p>, <p>Ah, fu*k it. What was I going to do then? Had I not taken lives until now? Was there another way? If I kept delaying, the path to ruin would begin to advance, leading to an ending engulfed in doom. To escape this world before that main event triggers, I have to amass power by any means necessary.</p>, <p>“No, wait. I don’t have to kill anyone, right?”</p>, <p>Yes, that was it. There were homes I could take without having to murder innocent people. In fact, some even pleaded for me to take theirs…</p>, <p>There was this one particular house that seemed perfect. It wasn’t bad at all and it offered many beneficial options for a mage.</p>, <p>Although there were some challenging parts, overcoming them could grant me a level of power usually not attainable until much later in the game.</p>, <p>At this point, I made up my mind about my next course of action. I left the overcrowded house behind and headed towards Vasilisa.</p>, <p>As I entered the café, a hush fell over the place.</p>, <p>Everyone glanced my way while whispering quietly among themselves.</p>, <p>No full sentences were distinctly audible, but words like “Je Mu-gyeong”, “The Triad” and “Wild Guns” occasionally reached my ears.</p>, <p>This was a recent change. Now, there was no one in Vasilisa who didn’t know me.</p>, <p>Outside of Vasilisa, the name Kim Shin-hwa and the Carcosa’s mask I wore had become quite well-known too.</p>, <p>I ignored their gazes and turned to Tudor. And as she usually did during her free time, she was sprawled in a corner of the cafe and reading a fantasy novel.</p>, <p>“Oh dear, you’re here? I didn’t call for you today, yet here you are.”</p>, <p>“Yes, this time I have a favor to ask of you.”</p>, <p>“Oh, a favor from you? That’s kind of scary.”</p>, <p>What’s so scary about that? Ignoring Tudor’s joke, I continued.</p>, <p>“I’d like you to narrow down the conditions for my next request.”</p>, <p>“Narrow down the conditions? Ah, it seems you have something specific in mind?”</p>, <p>“Exactly.”</p>, <p>There was one particular request I had in mind among those Tudor could arrange, but it would be odd to directly pick that one out, wouldn’t it?</p>, <p>What should I say to gloss it over?</p>, <p>“I’ve recently acquired some items related to necromancy, and I’d like to experiment with them.”</p>, <p>“Ahaan, so you did manage to pick up something from that mess, didn’t you?”</p>, <p>The mess referred to the sacred site of the cultists that I recently raided. The mission was completed successfully, and I was able to recover the idol…. But buildings collapsed, fires broke out, monsters suddenly flew from the sky, and all sorts of things happened.</p>, <p>“I hadn’t expected to encounter a genuine cultist capable of summoning magic. Nevertheless, I made sure not to bring back anything that could be traced back to us.”</p>, <p>“It’s unlike you to leave traces that could lead to being tracked. As for necromancy, what exactly do you wish to accomplish?”</p>, <p>“I’m not particular about the level of difficulty; if there are any requests to resolve psychic phenomenon, I’d like you to arrange them for me.”</p>, <p>“Any psychic phenomenon?”</p>, <p>“Let’s avoid possessions… they’re troublesome. I’d prefer something related to a property or real estate that can be resolved with a wide-reaching suppression.”</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>Tudor placed a finger on her lips and started thinking.</p>, <p>Given the current circumstances, there should be a few requests that fit the criteria.</p>, <p>“I recall there was something like that on the network… “I think I probably skipped it because the conditions weren’t that good.”</p>, <p>“I’m not too concerned about the payment.”</p>, <p>“So, shall I look into it and get back to you with the details? You’ll probably hear from me by tomorrow at the latest.”</p>, <p>“Sounds good.”</p>, <p>“Necromancy, though… Should I start considering that area for future requests?”</p>, <p>What a troubling kindness. Practicing necromancy was merely an excuse to convince Tudor.</p>, <p>“As I mentioned, it’s for practice, so let’s see how this goes and then decide.”</p>, <p>What I really want isn’t to practice necromancy.

            "[<p>The request concerned properties and estates afflicted by spiritual disturbances.</p>, <p>In the end, the request is to find a place that is commonly referred to as a haunted mansion or, to put it simply, a haunted house.</p>, <p><em>Hmm, a classic narrative indeed. Being a horror game and all, wouldn’t it be appropriate to visit a haunted house at this point?</em></p>, <p>Historically, the Cthulhu mythos and related creative works often featured various haunted mansions.</p>, <p>In the world crafted on the foundation of the Cthulhu mythos, [Cthulhu World], there existed a wide array of haunted properties.</p>, <p>These properties were generally known as cursed houses or abandoned buildings, with most of them not being in a livable condition. However, among them were houses that would be quite decent if one were to overlook the presence of ghosts.</p>, <p>If you invade such a house, drive out the ghosts, and defeat the boss, you will be given a house as a reward.</p>, <p>Of course, it was no easy task. Overcoming the lethal obstacles was imperative, as these were no normal residences.</p>, <p><em>This is why preparation is necessary.</em></p>, <p>Tudor was not one to make frivolous comments regarding work.</p>, <p>Since she said that it would be ready by tomorrow, I would most likely find that request the next day.</p>, <p>I needed to have everything ready by tomorrow.</p>, <p>That’s why I hopped on my skateboard and sped off to the pawnshop in Geumchon Market, where I could find most of what I needed.</p>, <p>Perhaps it was because I arrived later than usual, but the pawnshop today felt even more calm and quiet. The late hour played a part, but there was another reason.</p>, <p>“No part-timer today?”</p>, <p>“She doesn’t work at pitch-black hours like this.”</p>, <p>“Fair enough.”</p>, <p>I requested a bundle of talismans along with various materials related to shamanism, psychism, and necromancy.</p>, <p>“Someone passed away? Why else would you buy this stuff?”</p>, <p>“Why do you always have to complain whenever I buy something?”</p>, <p>“Who’s complaining?”</p>, <p>“Ah, whatever.”</p>, <p>Today, there were no special items to dispose of. It was a straightforward purchase, so there was no need for haggling, and just like that, thirty-five million won was spent in an instant.</p>, <p>“So, no tricks today, just paying in cash?”</p>, <p>“When have I ever played tricks?”</p>, <p>“Ah, whatever.”</p>, <p>Considering that I hadn’t yet decided on a specific request to take on, it was a bold purchase. But at this point, such an amount of money isn’t a major issue for me. If necessary, I could simply make a quick round the next day, or I could dispose of some of the oddities piled up at home and recover the costs promptly.</p>, <p>On the way back after I completed my preparations, I met an unexpected person in an unexpected place.</p>, <p>It was a dark back alley in the Geumchon neighborhood, cluttered with scattered flyers and pamphlets.</p>, <p>This alley was so seldom frequented that I, who often used it, had never imagined meeting anyone here.</p>, <p>And the person I met in this damp and dark alleyway was…</p>, <p>“Ahem. Ahem. It’s been a while.”</p>, <p>The sentence structure was perfectly modern standard Korean, but the voice carried a strange and unfamiliar accent.</p>, <p>It was Park Kwang-lim, one of the brokers in Paju.</p>, <p>“It has been a while, but what happened to you?”</p>, <p>“There was… a bit of trouble with a client… Ahem, ahem. And I ended up like this.”</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim was dressed in an old-fashioned suit similar to the one he wore the last time we met, but its condition was pathetic.</p>, <p>It was torn in several places, with burn marks evident throughout. His white shirt was almost completely blackened with ash. And upon closer inspection, his once cherished bowler hat was nowhere to be seen and in its place was a scattered mess of long hair.</p>, <p>“Ahem, ahem. Cough.”</p>, <p>Moreover, his intermittent hollow coughs grated on my ears.</p>, <p>“Seems like a fixer who got paid decided to set your office ablaze, huh?”</p>, <p>“Uhahaha-“</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim let out a hearty laugh as if amused.</p>, <p>“Not entirely wrong. It wasn’t a fixer but a client who started the fire.”</p>, <p>“Ah-“</p>, <p>It was then that I fully grasped the ordeal Park Kwang-lim had faced.</p>, <p>No matter how crazy Paju was, there weren’t many clients crazy enough to set fire to a broker’s office. The reason for his disheveled appearance before me became clear.</p>, <p>“Stay back.”</p>, <p>“Cough, cough. You’re overdoing it.”</p>, <p>“You know why I’m doing this, right?”</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim bent forward with a wry smile.</p>, <p>These were exaggerated movements reminiscent of those of a magician preparing for a magic trick.</p>, <p>It wasn’t a gesture for a 90-degree bow. He was reaching for a flyer that had fallen to the floor. With a slow hand, Park Kwang-lim picked up one of the flyers scattered around…</p>, <p>[System: The ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ trait has been activated.]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>, <p>Suddenly, the flyer burst into flames.</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim was someone suffering from a condition known as magical hypertrophy. Even in these dark times, he navigates the back alleys of Paju with ease thanks to his extraordinary powers.</p>, <p>However, his ability does not involve igniting flames. It’s evident in the way the magic moves when the flames arise and, notably, the unsettling mass that has clung to his left shoulder from the beginning.</p>, <p>“My left hand is cursed with a living flame.”</p>, <p>This was a huge declaration that could only be posted on an online community for Chuunibyou middle school students.</p>, <p>I thought of a few jokes, but Park Kwang-lim’s overly serious expression made me hold my tongue.</p>, <p>“Did the descendants of Fomalhaut get that angry? How much of an advance did you take to end up with such a severe curse?”</p>, <p>“Really, it’s really, really troublesome. Could you possibly lend me a hand?”</p>, <p>While Park Kwang-lim was a competent broker, he was also a very good con artist.</p>, <p>The descendants of Fomalhaut, a cult that worships the [Living Flame], hired him to track me down. In Paju, no one matches Park Kwang-lim’s skill in finding people.</p>, <p>Despite having identified me long ago, Park Kwang-lim had not handed me over to the descendants of Fomalhaut.</p>, <p>But as the saying goes, you should measure your bed before stretching your legs. It seems the impatient cultists have resorted to cursing Park Kwang-lim for his reluctance.</p>, <p>“Sounds like poetic justice to me.”</p>, <p>“Poetic justice? Isn’t this because I protected Kim Shin-hwa and ended up like this? Cough, ahem!”</p>, <p>The longer he drags it out, the more he can bill, right? I have a rough idea of the games Park Kwang-lim plays with his gullible clients. Given the nature of detective work where fees increase with time, solving cases quickly was actually counterproductive.</p>, <p>Moreover, he probably planned to leverage the fact that the descendants of Fomalhaut were after me to make additional demands.</p>, <p>“Cough, cough! Ack!”</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>, <p>The dark alley briefly lit up before plunging back into darkness.</p>, <p>“Wow! Hahaha! Damn it, did you see that?”</p>, <p>I certainly did.</p>, <p>Flames had burst forth from his mouth unexpectedly.</p>, <p>This is no joke. It seems the curse isn’t just spreading to his hand but to various parts of his body as well.</p>, <p>“Ah, this is indeed serious.”</p>, <p>“Huhu… Kukukuku… Ah, it really is severe. Please, help me. Cough, ahem.”</p>, <p>An abnormal laughter began to mix with Park Kwang-lim’s words. No matter how tough someone is, it won’t be easy to stay sane if symptoms like that appear. By now, his brain must be marinating in dopamine and adrenaline.</p>, <p>“Kwang-lim-sshi, let me say this again: I really don’t know anything. Even if you were to betray me, your Fomalhaut friends would be disappointed. I’d feel wronged too. Besides, Tudor, who’s been excited to use me for various things lately, would be heartbroken if something were to happen to me, right?”</p>, <p>In Park Kwang-lim’s world, a disappointed Tudor would be the greatest danger.</p>, <p>“Ah, I understand. That’s why I’m asking for your help, isn’t it?”</p>, <p>Now, with a look of desperation, he began to slowly approach me. The level of the curse was indeed severe.</p>, <p>A curse of this magnitude isn’t something that can be triggered just like that. It would require at least one human sacrifice to the [Living Flame].</p>, <p>How to lift it, though? Destroying, burning, and exploding things are simple, but lifting a curse is not my specialty.</p>, <p>If I had a ticket to the Thousand Gold Temple, perhaps I could solve it easily, but I’m not at that level yet.</p>, <p>Moreover, although it’s possible to borrow the power of the [Living Flame] through the [Ring of Corrupted Flame], the situation is different now.</p>, <p>It’s a curse formally requested by cultists who even offered human sacrifices. Would they lend their power to undo such a curse?</p>, <p>I visibly sighed and activated the magic.</p>, <p>[Insight]</p>, <p>[Curse Detection]</p>, <p>[Magic power Detection]</p>, <p>[Trap Detection]</p>, <p>[Lifeform Detection]</p>, <p>“It seems there are no watchers around. Did you manage to shake off any pursuers?”</p>, <p>“Hmm, I’m not such a trivial person.”</p>, <p>“Well, that must be why such a severe curse was placed on you.”</p>, <p>“Cough, cough, cough!”</p>, <p><em>Whoooooosh!</em></p>, <p>Once again, flames burst forth with a cough. His situation was getting more and more dangerous It seems Park Kwang-lim has less than 48 hours to chatter like this.</p>, <p>There are three options before me now.</p>, <p>The first is to simply walk away, which, frankly, is not a good decision. Leaving him be might lead to his own demise, but before that happens, he might rush to the cultists and betray me.</p>, <p>If I want to stop such a loose-lipped fool from blabbering, making him unable to speak forever could be a solution. After all, the dead tell no tales.</p>, <p>But then again, is it really worth it to waste a high-level NPC like Park Kwang-lim?</p>, <p>Although he was a vulgar swindler, his skills were unmatched in certain limited fields.</p>, <p>Choosing the third option seems best. Granting him a favor now might lead to repayment later.</p>, <p>I spoke to Park Kwang-lim while scratching my head.</p>, <p>“You should know how lucky you are. If it weren’t for today, I wouldn’t have been able to help even if I wanted to.”</p>, <p>“Ah! So there’s a way? As expected from the rising star of Paju, the enigmatic genius mage, the dark horse of Vasilisa rapidly gaining fame, the secret weapon of the Triad.”</p>, <p>“What’s with those ridiculous titles?”</p>, <p>And what about the Triad?</p>, <p>“Ahem, ahem. Kuhuhum. These are the stories that are circulating these days. There are rumors that you are a biological weapon created from Helistic, and there are also stories that you are an incarnation of a god summoned by mistake.”</p>, <p>“This is madness, really.”</p>, <p>Tudor had promised to make me famous, and it seemed she was working hard at it.</p>, <p>Under normal circumstances, I might not have had a solution, but this was not a regular day. If it hadn’t been right after a shopping spree for a visit to a haunted house, why else would I have been wandering the back alleys of the Geumchon neighborhood with a bunch of exorcism-related items in hand?</p>, <p>“So, how much can you pay?”</p>, <p>“…How much do you require?”</p>, <p>“Just quote an amount you’d equate with the value of your life.”</p>, <p>“……..”</p>, <p>“No, I don’t take pleasure in bargaining over human lives. Let’s just say ten times the cost of materials. The materials roughly cost about 35 million so that makes it 350 million.”</p>, <p>These were items I had just acquired from the pawnshop today. I wasn’t entirely sure how things had gotten to this point, but those items would be used as materials.</p>, <p>“Cough, ahem. Haah… Thank you.”</p>, <p>Observing Park Kwang-lim’s expression, it seemed I had quoted less than he had expected. Even though he looked like this, he was a broker of the underworld. A figure like him could easily manage two or three hundred million as if it were nothing.</p>, <p>“Alright, I’ll take on the task.”</p>, <p>[You have accepted the quest!</p>, <p>&lt;Mini Quest: Broker on the Brink&gt;</p>, <p>Cultists worshiping the ‘Living Flame’ have cast a deadly curse on Park Kwang-lim.

            "[<p>“I’ll give it to you later, later.”</p>, <p>I wanted an advance payment, but Park Kwang-lim wasn’t in a position to do that. Even if he tried to make a transfer, his smartphone would probably burst into flames.</p>, <p>Besides, the method I’m considering isn’t a complete solution.</p>, <p>I took a moment to scan our surroundings.</p>, <p>This place isn’t ideal for the ritual. But what choice do I have? I’m not capable of securing a purified or quiet location, nor is it feasible to take him to my home.</p>, <p>I pulled out a few talismans from my backpack, some minor ritual tools, and… oh, this is pricey. A straw doll.</p>, <p>“Isn’t that a cursed doll?”</p>, <p>“In Japan, they might use it for cursing, but in Korea, it’s called a ‘Jeoung’ or ‘Cheo Yong’. It is typically used for warding off evil. Oh, and in China, it’s known as ‘Chu Ling’ you know?”</p>, <p>“Not really. I’m not good with occult stuff.”</p>, <p>Not all brokers are the same, it seems. Anyway, I was just reading the message that popped up in the message window.</p>, <p>“I can’t say for sure how much they screwed you over, but the curse you’re under seems to have involved the use of at least one live sacrifice. Such curses aren’t easily lifted.”</p>, <p>Even before Park Kwang-lim demonstrated his “magic trick” of burning an intact paper, I could see the curse afflicting him.</p>, <p>The insights I gained coupled with a few spells I activated helped me visualize the nature of this curse.</p>, <p>“There’s a woman hanging over your left shoulder.”</p>, <p>“…Somehow, the genre seems to be shifting in an odd direction.”</p>, <p>“It’s a bit embarrassing for me to say this, it sounds like something out of a cult. So let’s refrain from unnecessary remarks.”</p>, <p>But it’s true.</p>, <p>The transparent ghost of a woman with burns all over her body hung on his shoulder.</p>, <p><em>-Grrrrr…</em></p>, <p>Who this woman was and what life she led, I couldn’t say. Now, she had become a ghost devoid of will, merely spreading hatred in obedience to some unseen command.</p>, <p>“This will make for an interesting test.”</p>, <p>“A test?”</p>, <p>Ah, I’ve accidentally expressed my true thoughts.</p>, <p>I felt a twinge of guilt towards Park Kwang-lim, given his dire circumstances, but this presented an excellent opportunity for me to practice. I was about to head to a place riddled with traps related to necromancy. There weren’t many opportunities to test this type of magic.</p>, <p>“This will be my first time using this spell.”</p>, <p>“…Is that safe?”</p>, <p>“I’m not sure. If you’re scared, you could ask someone else for help. Do you know anyone who has an admission ticket to Thousand Gold Temple?”</p>, <p>“Ahem, Ahem no, I do not.”</p>, <p>Thousand Gold Temple was a unique shop and the only one of its kind in the entire country that was capable of resolving issues related to curses and cults.</p>, <p>“So, what will it be?”</p>, <p>“I’ll have to ask for your help.”</p>, <p>“Alright. It’s awkward to start right here, let’s move to a more secluded spot.”</p>, <p>However, finding a significantly special location was out of the question.</p>, <p>I had been stranded in Paju within the [Cthulhu World] for several months now. During this time, I could barely secure a space for my body to lie down.</p>, <p>Even setting aside my limited social connections, finding a space suitable for conducting the ritual at hand was difficult.</p>, <p>“If we’re going to do it in an arbitrary space, we might as well do it here.”</p>, <p>“Here? How is this any different from before?”</p>, <p>We had moved, after all.</p>, <p>From one back alley in the Geumchon neighborhood to another alley in the Geumchon neighborhood.</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim’s bewildered reaction was understandable given that we had only moved about 100 meters.</p>, <p>“This place is a bit more secluded than before—”</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim glanced around and his lips started twitching as if he was about to voice a complaint.</p>, <p>“—Not in a physical sense, but magically.”</p>, <p>“…I see.”</p>, <p>That doesn’t mean I plan to proceed haphazardly.</p>, <p>It would be no different from performing open-heart surgery outdoors.</p>, <p>I reached into my backpack and pulled out several items: a bundle of talismans I had bought today and what Jeong Eun-taek called ritual supplies, such as wooden cups and candlesticks.</p>, <p>Though these items were indeed used in sacrificial rituals, they were versatile enough for various rituals.</p>, <p>“So, with these…”</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p>[Spell Enhancement: Multicasting]</p>, <p><em>Chalalalalak!!</em></p>, <p>Dozens of invisible hands began to place the talismans and ritual vessels all around the alley.</p>, <p>Then.</p>, <p><em>Pop!</em></p>, <p>The crisp sound of a bottle being opened resonated.</p>, <p>Now that I think about it, it was hard to deny that these were preparations for a sacrificial ritual. This wasn’t clear liquor but a kind of fermented alcohol. It wasn’t just any ordinary one, though.</p>, <p>“How touching, to use heavenly yellow wine.”</p>, <p>“Ah, you’re familiar with it?”</p>, <p>“It’s quite an expensive medicinal alcohol, isn’t it?”</p>, <p>“Well, it could indeed substitute for medicine.”</p>, <p>It was such an expensive liquor that it was listed a “B-rank Elixir” in the message window. It could be used as medicine, a component in magic, or even as a catalyst in simple rituals.</p>, <p>“It originated from China.”</p>, <p>“Really? Everything’s from China now, is it?”</p>, <p>I scattered the alcohol in all directions and started preparing for the ritual in earnest.</p>, <p>I counted to seven, held the heavenly yellow wine in my mouth, then after counting to seven again, spat it out onto the ground and counted to seven once more.</p>, <p>“Pheww…”</p>, <p>I let out a deep sigh.</p>, <p>It was a different kind of breath than the usual deep breathing.</p>, <p>Unlike the real world, the air in the Paju of Cthulhu World wasn’t clean. It wasn’t a matter of accessibility to nature.</p>, <p>The air in this city, which was infested with abyssal creatures, otherworldly monsters, nefarious mages, and cultists, was too heavily mingled with a chaotic spiritual energy.</p>, <p>That’s why there was a need to purify the very act of breathing itself.</p>, <p>I took another long breath.</p>, <p>This time, my breath was infused with my magical power.</p>, <p>“Pheww…”</p>, <p>Park Kwang-lim who had been standing awkwardly noticeably flinched as he sensed the dense magical power contained in my breath.</p>, <p>A dark, damp, and moist corner of the back alley in the Geumchon neighborhood began to purify gradually with my breath.</p>, <p>“Normally, you’d form hand seals and recite mantras here, but I’ll skip that.”</p>, <p>“Is it really okay to skip…?”</p>, <p>“There’s something like ‘Namah Samanta Vajranam… and so on. I’m not a professional exorcist, so I’m not confident in explaining. Just stay put and enjoy the outcome.”</p>, <p>It’s a mantra written in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā.</p>, <p>Thanks to abilities like [Casting Omission] that I possess, I could skip such unnecessary steps and directly activate the magic.</p>, <p>[Ibn Ghazi’s Beacon]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>, <p>My breath soon transformed into a blazing white flame that surged toward Park Kwang-lim.</p>, <p><em>-Aaaaagh!</em></p>, <p>The ghost clinging to Park Kwang-lim’s body was pushed back by the flames I created and started screaming. At the same time, its spirit form which was visible only to my eyes finally revealed its true form.</p>, <p>“Ah, aaaaaah!”</p>, <p>Oh, stupid Park Kwang-lim.</p>, <p>[Sound Distortion]</p>, <p>“Be quiet! Do you want to draw the whole neighborhood here?”</p>, <p>“Monster! A monster! There’s a monster!”</p>, <p>Perhaps I had been too harsh in my words to someone who had just witnessed a monster clinging to their body.</p>, <p>[A previously unseen curse revealed its form. The spiritual pursuer created by evil rituals, the corrupted guardian spirit, and the enforcer of contracts. The monster with skin writhing horribly like melted rubber was destined to continue infusing the element of fire into the soul of its victim to fulfill its assigned mission.]</p>, <p>An unpleasant body swarming with maggot-like spirits.</p>, <p>Its hands had mutated into pincer-like appendages and its skin stretched so grotesquely that it resembled elastic rubber.</p>, <p>A Corrupted who was forced to reveal its physical form by magic.</p>, <p>It was an abhorrent minion crafted by cultists using power lent by beings from the abyss.</p>, <p>Despite its horrifying appearance, which was enough to shatter Park Kwang-lim’s sanity, it possessed an alien presence capable of influencing the human mind.</p>, <p>[Attempting to resist fear with your mental strength stat.

Mental agitation has been nullified.]</p>, <p>The problem was swiftly nullified.</p>, <p>I had waited too long for the trait “Madness of the Abyss” to fully activate. The Corrupted revealed its hideous teeth which were akin to those of a shark and let out a revolting scream.</p>, <p><em>-Graaaaah!!</em></p>, <p>It was fortunate that I had prepared a sound distortion barrier in advance.</p>, <p>It seemed to harbor anger toward me for forcibly materializing it. It glared at me before clumsily lifting its pincer-like limbs.</p>, <p><em>Grrrrrrrrr!!</em></p>, <p>As befitting a monster born under the influence of [Living Flame], the Corrupted conjured corrupted black flames around its pincers and charged at me.</p>, <p>“Hey, hey, don’t come any closer.”</p>, <p>A brilliantly shining barrier formed around me.</p>, <p>[Tindalos’s Shell]</p>, <p>This barrier, which resembled a turtle shell, was not designed to repel physical forces but to block spiritual beings.</p>, <p>Sceeeeeeek!</p>, <p>The Corrupted swung its menacing claws covered in flames and pounded on the barrier repeatedly, but it lacked the strength to break through.</p>, <p><em>Sceeeeeeeeeek! Bang! Bang!</em></p>, <p>It was clear that this creature lacked proper reasoning. It seemed not to comprehend that its attacks had little effect on me and just continued scratching at the magical barrier. Yet, that was all it could do; its efforts were feeble compared to the power it possessed.</p>, <p>Was this monster not supposed to be more formidable?</p>, <p>“Ah, it seems it can’t exert its full strength because I’m not the target of the curse?”</p>, <p>Had I been the target of the curse, this level of purification and barrier wouldn’t have been enough to stop it.</p>, <p>“I, I, I am…?”</p>, <p>“Shh, keep quiet. You’re intentionally drawing attention here.”</p>, <p>“…….”</p>, <p><em>-Kirrrrrr!</em></p>, <p>“Ah! It, it’s starting to notice me?”</p>, <p>“See, that’s why I told you to keep quiet.”</p>, <p>I gathered my magical power and lifted the [Butcher’s Hook].</p>, <p>[The unique effect of the S-rank weapon ‘Butcher’s Hook’, ‘Proof of Slaughter’ has been activated.</p>, <p>// Proof of Slaughter: The power of necromancy spells increases by 100%.]</p>, <p>[Spirit Collision]</p>, <p><em>Kreeeeeeek!</em></p>, <p>A grotesque form of energy projectile was released along with a terrible noise that sounded like the scream of a ghost.</p>, <p><em>Boom!</em></p>, <p><em>-Aghhhhhhh!</em></p>, <p>Immediately followed by…</p>, <p>[R’lyeh’s Flash]</p>, <p><em>Wham!!</em></p>, <p>A burst of dry noise followed by a brilliant white flash.

As the Corrupted writhed, the chains threatened to snap and break in an instant.</p>, <p>However, they managed to prevent it from charging at Park Kwang-lim for the moment. It was crucial to subdue it right then.</p>, <p><em>But now… what should I do?</em></p>, <p>The Corrupted wasn’t a living creature. It was a being of the abyss, or more precisely, an abstract entity existing in reality through the sanction of the [Living Flame].</p>, <p>Among the spells I could use at this stage, there were some that could weaken or damage it, but none that could eliminate it.</p>, <p><em>To get rid of it, I’d have to destroy the evidence of the ritual used to summon it…</em></p>, <p>But there was no way to find it now. Perhaps it was in a secret place near Unjeong Station? The secret temple installed above the subway tracks. It was likely there.

In the meantime—”</p>, <p>As long as Park Kwang-lim remained within the range of influence of the one who made the ritual, the curse would persist.</p>, <p>If, in the meantime, that person were to exert a force exceeding the durability of the Jeoung, its destruction would result in an explosion powerful enough to leave nothing of Park Kwang-lim, not even his bones.</p>, <p>“—I’d recommend leaving Paju and finding somewhere to hide.”</p>, <p>To put it another way, if he could stay far away from the person in charge of the ritual, the effect of the curse could be temporarily stopped.</p>, <p>If we’re lucky, the person might give up on maintaining the curse and the curse may be lifted.</p>, <p>I explained all this to him.</p>, <p>“I won’t charge you until we find a solution, so please, spend at least a month or two outside of Gyeonggi Province.”</p>, <p>[Quest Information Updated.</p>, <p>! Time Limit: Park Kwang-lim will die in (45) days. !]</p>, <p>Forty-five days, huh? Could I manage to secure a ticket to the Thousand Gold Temple within that time?</p>, <p>“Come to think of it, my coughing has stopped.”</p>, <p>“That’s because the Jeoung is bearing the curse’s effects for now. If you lose it, the curse could reactivate, so always keep it with you.”</p>, <p>“I understand. And…”</p>, <p>“Yes?”</p>, <p>“You said you wouldn’t take any money, but… Honestly, I never expected you to help me like this. Could I offer you something, at least a part of what I owe?”</p>, <p>Huh? Why is this con man acting like this?</p>, <p>[However, you have shown remarkable achievements, so a portion of the quest rewards will be settled in advance.</p>, <p>Rewards: 150,000XP + Park Kwang-lim’s Trust + 150 Million Won]</p>, <p>[Park Kwang-lim, a broker who was close to a heartless conman, has been deeply moved by the dedicated attitude you showed. He now holds you in high regard.]</p>, <p>Ah, high regard. It’s like the affection one feels before forming a firm alliance.</p>, <p>The idea of giving money due to newfound affection does seem like a plausible development.</p>, <p>Is Park Kwang-lim’s change in attitude a response to the updates in the quest window, or has the quest window been updated in response to changes in Park Kwang-lim’s psychological state?</p>, <p><em>Which came first?</em></p>, <p>Whether Park Gwang-lim who is happy to be alive in front of me is truly human or merely an NPC moving according to the system might be a more significant question than it seems.</p>, <p><em>***</em></p>, <p>Tudor turned out to be a more capable broker than I expected.</p>, <p>“I thought there would be two or three requests prepared at best.”</p>, <p>“Hmm, it seems you’ve underestimated me.”</p>, <p>The very next day after I had made my request, I received a message from Tudor instructing me to come to Vasilisa immediately, so I came back to Vasilisa.</p>, <p>Upon arrival, Tudor asked why I was so late and dragged me into her office, where she proceeded to introduce the requests.</p>, <p>Tudor had found a total of eight requests.</p>, <p>The sight of documents summarizing the essence of each request, neatly laid out across the table, was quite something to behold.</p>, <p>Such diligence… though there was hardly a need to gather so many.</p>, <p><em>No, that’s not it.</em></p>, <p>Tudor was well aware that I would only undertake one of these requests.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, this excessive preparation meant that she valued me more than other fixers.</p>, <p>“The one I’d recommend most for you is this one right here.”</p>, <p>Tudor pointed her finger at the document furthest to the left.</p>, <p>Given Tudor’s efforts in gathering this information, I felt obliged to at least pretend to review the document.</p>, <p>“Let’s see… a haunted house in Munsan.”</p>, <p>“How about it? This might be something you’re familiar with. It’s a famous haunted house that’s been featured on broadcasts a few times. Streamers used to visit quite often…. until a couple of years ago when people started dying, and it turned out to be the real deal.”</p>, <p>“It sounds like a typical haunted house ghost story.”</p>, <p>“Right. But around last year, some rich individual with nothing better to do announced a reward for anyone who could cleanse the haunted house. Since then, it’s become quite famous among those involved with the supernatural.”</p>, <p>“Seeing that the bounty is still up, it seems no one has succeeded so far?”</p>, <p>“You’re quick to catch on. I knew they had increased the amount a few times, but when I checked recently, the sum was quite substantial.”</p>, <p>“How much?”</p>, <p>“150 million.”</p>, <p>“That’s quite a bit.”</p>, <p>However, this wasn’t the request I was looking for.</p>, <p>Moreover, the phenomena at the Munsan haunted house weren’t actually ghostly in nature.</p>, <p><em>It was a murder game.</em></p>, <p>A quest that turns into a plaything for rich old men who have gone mad with wealth.</p>, <p>Those enticed by the reward end up entangled in a manufactured murder game on a fabricated set.</p>, <p><em>I’m not looking for squid game type of stuff…</em></p>, <p>While it’s a quest that could yield great rewards for notable achievements, what I really need is a mansion that can serve as a base.</p>, <p>“Interesting story. But this time, I’m looking to practice, so I’d prefer something that can be handled more quietly. This one seems too noisy.”</p>, <p>Tudor didn’t look disappointed at all and took out another document.</p>, <p>“How about this one? It’s a case that can be resolved right here in the Geumchon neighborhood.”</p>, <p>There was supposed to be a ghost in a newly built apartment in the Geumchon neighborhood, but that wasn’t it either.</p>, <p>I quickly lost interest, yet Tudor continued with enthusiasm.</p>, <p>“Every month on the 13th, thirteen ghosts made entirely of bugs appear on the 13th floor of that apartment, making strange noises for 13 minutes before vanishing.”</p>, <p>“That…”</p>, <p>I was lucky. I had gotten over my fear of the number 13 long ago, or else just hearing this story might have made me faint.</p>, <p>“…No, it’s okay. This one isn’t quite right. Something else might be better.”</p>, <p>With that, I picked up another document that was nearby.</p>, <p>Aha.</p>, <p>This was it.</p>, <p>Luckily I didn’t have to manage my facial expressions thanks to the mask. This was precisely the request I had been searching for.</p>, <p>I made an effort to sound as casual as possible.</p>, <p>“This one seems quite promising.”</p>, <p>However, Tudor’s expression was somehow strange.</p>, <p>“Um… I did keep it because it fit the conditions, but it was a bit of an ambiguous request.</p>, <p>The first page of the document read as follows:</p>, <p>[Jangmyeongsan Detached Pension House]</p>, <p>“Where is Jangmyeongsan?”</p>, <p>“It’s not that good… Have you not been listening to me this whole time?”</p>, <p>“No, I’m listening attentively.”</p>, <p>Tudor pouted briefly before continuing.</p>, <p>“Jangmyeongsan is a small mountain located to the west of the Geumchon neighborhood, just past the Gongneung Stream. There’s a detached pension house there.”</p>, <p>“The compensation is ridiculous.”</p>, <p>[The entire estate of the client will be passed on to the one who resolves the issue.]</p>, <p>“It is ridiculous.”</p>, <p>Tudor continued to complain about why she generally avoids handling requests related to paranormal phenomena, that the people involved are either eccentrics, luxury seekers, or those with twisted minds, and that even when the job is done well, there’s a risk of not getting paid, among other things.</p>, <p>Due to that, it was only after going through all the documents to the very end that I was able to make my choice.</p>, <p>“Would it be alright to proceed with the Jangmyeongsan Detached Pension House?”</p>, <p>“Look, I knew you weren’t in your right mind from the start… but are you serious? Do you really think you can actually receive this compensation?”</p>, <p>“I’m perfectly sane. I’ve said from the beginning, I’m not particularly interested in the compensation.”</p>, <p>“It’s for your magical training, isn’t it? What about the fee…”</p>, <p>“If the fee is lost, I’ll cover it myself.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… I don’t know. Do as you wish.”</p>, <p>“Great. Then please contact the client for me.”</p>, <p>[You’ve accepted the quest!</p>, <p>&lt;Secure Base Quest: The Hungry Mansion&gt; Subdue all the evil spirits haunting the mansion and return it to a ‘safe’ state.</p>, <p>Remaining Objectives: Unknown.</p>, <p>Reward: 250,000XP + Ownership of the Mansion</p>, <p>Failure: Possession by an evil spirit.]</p>, <p>As expected, the quest message used the word “mansion” instead of “pension”.</p>, <p>The place I was set to visit was actually a privately owned mansion, not a pension.</p>, <p><em>The game’s setting hasn’t changed. It was always meant to be this way.</em></p>, <p>“Ah, and about this request, there’s a strange detail…”</p>, <p>“This, right? The client will accompany you during the quest.”</p>, <p>It was a place I had visited several times during the game.</p>, <p>Though the number of clears was fewer compared to other locations, my transcendent intelligence allowed me to remember everything about this mansion: the conditions for clearing it, the methods, the hidden elements, and even the secret rewards.</p>, <p>“Right, it seemed like they wanted to verify something? The information about the client is on the next page.”</p>, <p>I flipped through the pages of the document to the section containing the client’s information.</p>, <p>At the very top, the client’s name was written.</p>, <p>“The name is… Heo Sang-hyeon.”</p>, <p>Managing the client was the crux of this quest.</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon, the mansion’s owner and the client, was the most important NPC of this quest.</p>, <p>Without dealing with him, the quest would never conclude.</p>, <p>After all, the ghosts haunting this cursed mansion were also possessing Heo Sang-hyeon’s body.</p>, <p><em>This quest is essentially a trap created by evil spirits and beings from the abyss.</em></p>, <p>Starting with the homeowner, everything around this mansion was poised to attack me.</p>, <p>However, the reward offered was everything contained within the mansion.</p>, <p>[The Hungry Mansion].</p>, <p>This place was destined to become my new base of operations.</p>]\n",

            "[<p><em>Rumble…</em></p>, <p>The sound of thunder rolled in.</p>, <p><em>Whoosh…Tatatata….</em></p>, <p>And the sound of pouring rain. A deluge of heavy raindrops hammering on the car roof created a chaotic symphony.</p>, <p>Late at night.</p>, <p>In a dark lampless path through the forest.</p>, <p>The road was barely covered in asphalt and, due to long periods of neglect, was riddled with potholes and damage.</p>, <p>“The rain’s really coming down.”</p>, <p>This was the voice of Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim, it’s really raining. The rain, yes, a lot, really a lot, it’s raining heavily, really.”</p>, <p>When I didn’t respond, Jang Hyeon-deok emphasized his point by repeating himself several times.</p>, <p>“I hear it.”</p>, <p>“Ah, I thought you didn’t hear me since you didn’t reply. But seriously, Mage-nim, it’s really pouring.”</p>, <p>“Right.”</p>, <p>It was a tremendous downpour.</p>, <p>It wasn’t this bad when we set out, but by the time we neared our destination, it was pouring like a torrential downpour.</p>, <p>The day had turned completely dark, and we were on a secluded mountain path.</p>, <p>It was understandable why Jang Hyeon-deok felt uneasy.</p>, <p>“This place isn’t that far from the city, yet the atmosphere is a bit… creepy.”</p>, <p>“Right, it’s a bit creepy.”</p>, <p>“Ah, just to clarify, in case you misunderstand, I’m fine.”</p>, <p>“Right, you’re fine.”</p>, <p>“Yes. But this place really does give off a spooky vibe. It’s as if ghosts could appear at any moment.”</p>, <p>“Right.”</p>, <p>The rain was pouring heavily.</p>, <p>It was chilling to the bone.</p>, <p>It felt as if ghosts might appear at any moment.</p>, <p>That was going to be his next point. He had kicked aside other good requests to be here at Mage-nim’s behest. Loyalty, loyalty.</p>, <p>“I would still follow Mage-nim even if ghosts actually appeared! Oh, did I mention that? An incredible request came in today. It was proposed by the Traid; they were seeking a skilled driver to help in a breakout of captured gang members.”</p>, <p>“Right. Thirty million won.”</p>, <p>“Ah, that’s what I was going to say? That’s right. It’s not often that a request worth thirty million won comes in just for me. But who am I? Haven’t I rejected that request out of my loyalty and love for Mage-nim and came here instead!”</p>, <p>“Wow, that’s really impressive.”</p>, <p>“Ah, really! Are you going to respond so nonchalantly?”</p>, <p>“You’re the one… How many times are you going to repeat the same story…”</p>, <p>This was already the ninth time we’ve gone through this same pattern. And it was the nineteenth time he mentioned the heavy rain.</p>, <p><em>Rumble! Tatatatata!!</em></p>, <p>It looked like the rain wasn’t going to stop anytime soon.</p>, <p>Through the rain, a sinister mist was rising.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim, do you happen to know if there are any legends about this area around Jangmyeong Mountain?”</p>, <p>“Yes, I know.”</p>, <p>There was a legend that around Jangmyeong Mountain, a virgin ghost and a goblin appeared to torment passersby.</p>, <p>“They say that late at night, a virgin ghost appears to people walking on this road and tries to coax them into living with her at her place.”</p>, <p>“Right, a goblin appears too, right?”</p>, <p>“Ah, how did you know?”</p>, <p>“You’ve mentioned it about seven times already, so yes, I know it.”</p>, <p>“Yes, that’s right. If one avoids the virgin ghost, a nine-foot-tall goblin will leap out and drag them into the mud for a test of strength.”</p>, <p>“That’s amazing.”</p>, <p>“Mage-nim, I mean, it’s a bit of a sensitive topic, and I hope you won’t take it the wrong way. What I’m trying to say is…”</p>, <p>I already knew what Jang Hyeon-deok wanted to say.</p>, <p>“You can head back as soon as I get off.”</p>, <p>“Ah, it’s not that I’m scared, you see. I’ve been in this business for more than just a day or two, and the people who call for my services usually choose these late hours and secluded places.”</p>, <p>“So you’re used to it?”</p>, <p>“Yes, yes. Very used to it. Really.”</p>, <p>Despite his words, his expression betrayed a hint of unease.</p>, <p>Being accustomed to the night and secluded places didn’t necessarily mean being comfortable in a horror-like atmosphere.</p>, <p>The ambiance was eerie enough for us to not be surprised if a ghost appeared at any moment.</p>, <p>The negative energy was excessively concentrated here.</p>, <p>Even someone without a shaman’s spiritual abilities would feel something was wrong with such a place.</p>, <p>“We’re almost there. See that building? That’s the place.”</p>, <p>“Wow…”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok’s complexion turned pale.</p>, <p>“Isn’t that… Isn’t that a bit too much? How can such a building even exist?”</p>, <p>A grand mansion with an antique Western exterior.</p>, <p>It was [The Hungry Mansion].</p>, <p>Honestly, it was the epitome of a haunted house, one that anyone would acknowledge as impressively creepy.</p>, <p>“Did someone deliberately design it like this? It looks like something straight out of a theme park! A theme park!”</p>, <p>The mansion’s ominous exterior seemed as if someone had intentionally set out to craft the perfect haunted house.</p>, <p>Such a gloomy mansion stood in the rain, in the woods, in this dark hour.</p>, <p>The sight of the building made me feel a tad sorry for Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>“Well, it is a bit over the top.”</p>, <p>The design of the building itself wasn’t to blame.</p>, <p>Apart from its awkwardly Western appearance in the heart of Korea, it was merely a mansion with a somewhat antique design.</p>, <p>However, the problem lay in the malevolent and eerie energy that the mansion harbored.</p>, <p>It was a different kind from the abandoned hospital on Gamaksan Mountain. It was the repulsive and chilling aura of the dead.</p>, <p>It was so strong that one could almost believe the smell of corpses was seeping into the car.</p>, <p>The magical power, along with the evil energy and malice emanating from the entire building, was so intense that it distorted not just the building but the surrounding landscape as well.</p>, <p>Anyone who laid eyes on that building would inevitably feel an inexplicable unease and an instinctive terror.</p>, <p>“What is that?”</p>, <p>“Huh? Huh? Eeeeeeh?!”</p>, <p>Something bizarre and writhing was spotted on the roof of the building.</p>, <p>Though I wished to take a closer look, the surrounding trees obstructed the view.</p>, <p>Would it become visible if I moved just a bit closer?</p>, <p>What was crawling on the roof was…</p>, <p><em>A person?</em></p>, <p>On such a rainy day, was there someone on the roof?</p>, <p>No, it seemed to be more than just a person…</p>, <p>Suddenly, Jang Hyeon-deok screamed out loud.</p>, <p>“AAAAAAAH!!!”</p>, <p>Holy shit.</p>, <p>“What’s wrong!”</p>, <p>Had this guy lost his mind?</p>, <p>Before I could even respond, Jang Hyeon-deok slammed on the brakes.</p>, <p><em>Screeeeech!!!</em></p>, <p><em>Thud!!</em></p>, <p>There was a dull sensation as something collided with the car.</p>, <p>Something white flashed past the windshield too quickly for me to see what it was.</p>, <p>Before I could even identify it, I reflexively activated a spell.</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p><em>Screeeeeech!</em></p>, <p>The protective circle hadn’t formed around me but around the car, and something had collided with it.</p>, <p><em>Pop.</em></p>, <p><em>It’s gone. What was that?</em></p>, <p>It wasn’t a ghost. Something tangible had hit the protective circle.</p>, <p>But what?</p>, <p>Did Jang Hyeon-deok see it?</p>, <p>I stayed on guard and called out to Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>“Hey, did you see that?”</p>, <p>No reply came.</p>, <p>“Uh… Uh…”</p>, <p>Only a strangled groan.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok’s face had gone deathly pale.</p>, <p>I had never seen such a pallid expression on his face.</p>, <p>He was completely frozen with his eyes wide open.</p>, <p>“Hey, hey!”</p>, <p>“Uh… Uh…”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok, this guy, must have seen something.</p>, <p>“Hey, snap out of it! What did you see that’s got you all freaked out?”</p>, <p>“Uhh… Ugh…”</p>, <p>This wasn’t a normal reaction.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok had definitely seen something he shouldn’t have.</p>, <p>His body was so rigid it felt like stone.</p>, <p>Something must have appeared while I was distracted.</p>, <p>In [Cthulhu World] there were monsters whose mere form or presence could shatter a human’s mind with their malevolent essence.</p>, <p>“You’re supposed to be a professional in the underworld, man!”</p>, <p>Even if Jang Hyeon-deok was an expert driver accustomed to the underworld, that’s only within human limits.</p>, <p>The distortion effect of witnessing a supernatural entity does not discriminate.</p>, <p>Madness appeared as a result of him witnessing something, and the resulting distortion effect occurred.</p>, <p>In this state… a transparent message window appeared around Jang Hyeon-deok’s body.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>[Distortion—Psychosomatic Disorder]: Random status ailments occur for a certain period.</p>, <p>/ Temporary abnormalities occur in the body due to excessive mental shock. You might not be able to see, hear, or speak. In severe cases, paralysis can occur in the limbs.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok’s current condition: Paralyzed</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>“Hey, man! Snap out of it!”</p>, <p>“Uh… Uh… Uhh…”</p>, <p>This was not going to work.</p>, <p>I shouted several more times, but there was no response.</p>, <p>The stiffness in his muscles was worrying.</p>, <p>While lashing out or falling over could be problematic, paralysis was a serious issue in its own right.</p>, <p>In the worst-case scenario, he could suffocate while still conscious but unable to breathe.</p>, <p>“Damn it, this isn’t my specialty.”</p>, <p>None of the magic I could use had the effect of curing madness or eliminating distortion. However, waking someone up… I had tried it before when waking up Jeong Hyeon-ah.</p>, <p>[Exhilaration]</p>, <p>[Brilliance of the Eagle]</p>, <p>[Courage of the Lion]</p>, <p>The magic incited a battle desire, uplifting the spirit and boosting mental strength while simultaneously igniting courage. Furthermore, these spells were beneficial for vitality and were excellent for invigoration.</p>, <p>“This isn’t enough…”</p>, <p>As was the case with Jeong Hyeon-ah before, these spells were merely effective in preparing the body to rise. To actually open one’s eyes, a stronger stimulus was needed, such as a powerful electric shock…</p>, <p>[Voice of Authority]</p>, <p>A spell that temporarily controls humans weaker than myself.</p>, <p><strong>Jang Hyeon-deok, open your eyes.</strong></p>, <p>“Ah! Ugh… Ugh…”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok began to roll his eyes as he exhaled deeply.</p>, <p>Blood rushed to his eyes, turning them bright red with congestion.</p>, <p>“That’s right. Breathe slowly. It’s okay.”</p>, <p>“Huff… Huff… Ah… Haah… Uh… Mage-nim…”</p>, <p>Life began to return to his eyes.</p>, <p>“Are you coming to your senses?”</p>, <p>After mumbling incompletely a few times, the words he finally managed to utter were somewhat offbeat.</p>, <p>“Did you see? The one I hit… It was a person, right?”</p>, <p>That was a subtle way to put it.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok was implying that he hoped what he had hit was indeed a person.</p>, <p>“What if it wasn’t?”</p>, <p>“Huh?”</p>, <p>“What did you see? Tell me exactly what you observed.”</p>, <p>We haven’t even reached the mansion yet.</p>, <p>It’s too soon for anything to happen.</p>, <p>It would be more realistic if we had hit someone who had lost his way.</p>, <p>“It might sound strange to Mage-nim, but… I hope what I saw was a person! No, it must have been a person!”</p>, <p>“I understand, now try to calm down for a moment.”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok was not yet in his right mind.</p>, <p>The madness shimmering in his eyes, his unstable breathing, his incoherent speech and his excessively high temperature.</p>, <p>In such a state, scolding him would only backfire.</p>, <p>I shifted my gaze from Jang Hyeon-deok and looked outside the car.</p>, <p><em>Splish splash… drip drip…</em></p>, <p>The sound of the pouring rain…</p>, <p>And the darkness.</p>, <p>It felt like something might attack me at any moment If I were to go outside.</p>, <p>I hate getting wet in the rain…</p>, <p>[Distortion Field]</p>, <p>A semi-circular transparent dome made of magical power formed around us.</p>, <p>“The sound of the rain…”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok wore a surprised expression on his face.</p>, <p>The sound of rain hitting the car suddenly disappeared.</p>, <p>“I’ve created an umbrella with magic.”</p>, <p>It was a distortion field that refracts long-range attacks.</p>, <p>Though it may not be considered an attack, it can definitely refract raindrops.</p>, <p>It should also be able to block any long-distance sniping attempts.</p>, <p>“Just wait here. I’ll go check it out.”</p>, <p>“Ah… Wait, just a moment, please!”</p>, <p>“Oh, why?”</p>, <p>Irritation began to seep into my voice.</p>, <p>“T-Too fast…… Can you go a bit slower….”</p>, <p>“Oh, come on…”</p>, <p><em>Click.</em></p>, <p>Ignoring Jang Hyeon-deok’s nonsense, I opened the car door.</p>, <p>A tremendous amount of rain was falling outside the car.</p>, <p>However, due to the effect of the distortion field acting like an umbrella, the rain pouring around the car scattered in all directions.</p>, <p>I amplified my senses using magical power.</p>, <p>I was on the alert, but nothing out of the ordinary appeared.</p>, <p>“There’s nothing here.”</p>, <p>“Oh, nothing?”</p>, <p>That was Jang Hyeon-deok’s voice from behind the rolled-down window.</p>, <p>“Yeah, nothing.”</p>, <p>“Then, shall we go?”</p>, <p>“No.”</p>, <p>A pure white thing appeared in front along with a thumping sound.</p>, <p>Evidently, the car had hit something.</p>, <p>I slowly walked towards the front of the car.</p>, <p>The bumper of Jang Hyeon-deok’s speedy call van was slightly dented.</p>, <p>“It seems we definitely hit something…”</p>, <p>And this is…</p>, <p>There were marks on the bumper where part of it was sharply cut.</p>, <p>“Knife marks?”</p>, <p>On one corner of the bumper, there were four parallel traces.</p>, <p>No, not knife marks.</p>, <p>They were claw marks.</p>]\n",

Take deep breaths, deep breaths!”</p>, <p>I infused Jang Hyeon-deok’s body with magical power and reactivated the enchantment I had placed on him before.</p>, <p>“Haah… Hoo… Huff…”</p>, <p>He seemed a bit calmer now.</p>, <p>“Let’s head back to the car.”</p>, <p>“Yes…”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok staggered towards the driver’s seat.</p>, <p>There’s a chance it could flare up again later.</p>, <p>Honestly, madness to the point of a mental breakdown couldn’t be so easily treated. For a regular person, his resilience was remarkable. Could it be due to his mediumship talent?</p>, <p>As soon as we sat in the car, Jang Hyeon-deok started again.</p>, <p>“It definitely wasn’t human…”</p>, <p>“Stop talking about that now.”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok was probably mistaken. It seemed better to send him back at this point.</p>, <p>“A strange, strange woman. It was definitely a woman.”</p>, <p>Trembling, Jang Hyeon-deok continued.</p>, <p>“It-it looked like a person, for sure. But… could it really be a person? The eyes, the eyes were definitely…”</p>, <p>Unable to contain his fear, he grasped his shoulders with both hands and curled up.</p>, <p>“The eyes were completely black, and so large. It was clear there was nothing there…”</p>, <p>“Suddenly appeared, you say?”</p>, <p>“Yes…”</p>, <p>It was the ghost of [The Hungry Mansion].</p>, <p>Normally, ghosts without a physical form shouldn’t be able to get hit by cars or scratch bumpers.</p>, <p>But it moved outside the mansion?</p>, <p>“Normally, the area outside the mansion should have been safe.”</p>, <p><em>Rumble… BOOM!</em></p>, <p>The sound of thunder crashing came from outside the car.</p>, <p>And the torrential downpour still pouring down.</p>, <p>The thick darkness where not even the moon was visible.</p>, <p>The dense and damp yin energy enveloping the entire mountain.</p>, <p>The smell of death emanated by the spirits.</p>, <p>I could roughly guess what happened.</p>, <p>“It seems we chose the wrong day.”</p>, <p>No, it was the client who had set the date for the appointment.</p>, <p>It would be fair to say that just as I had prepared, so had the enemy.</p>, <p><em>And to add to that…</em></p>, <p>[Feast offering].</p>, <p>A penalty trait that increases the likelihood of encountering beings from the abyss.</p>, <p>One of the beings of the abyss interested in me was lending its power to the ghosts.</p>, <p>“If they start attacking us from here, it changes everything.”</p>, <p>The development of the game changed due to the intervention of the abyssal entity.</p>, <p>I glanced momentarily at the duffel bag lying on the back seat.</p>, <p>It was from a well-known sports brand.</p>, <p>It was a bag I had acquired because not everything could fit into my backpack.</p>, <p><em>I’ve come well prepared, so it should work out somehow…</em></p>, <p>“Anyway, Jang Hyeon-deok, you should turn back here.”</p>, <p>“Me?”</p>, <p>“Plans have changed a bit. I’ll get off here, so you go back.”</p>, <p>“But, that’s…”</p>, <p>“Don’t worry, I’ve deposited the fee for the request and the repair costs with Tudor, so you can claim it when you get back.”</p>, <p>“That’s…”</p>, <p>I took out one of the items I had prepared.</p>, <p>A large yellow paper with red writing scrawled across it.</p>, <p>A consumable artifact of typical design.</p>, <p>It was a talisman.</p>, <p>“Here.”</p>, <p>“What’s this?”</p>, <p>“Can’t you tell? It’s a talisman.”</p>, <p>I took out a few more talismans and affixed them to the car windows.</p>, <p>“There, you should be fine now.”</p>, <p>“Really?”</p>, <p>“Maybe?”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>“No, no, really, you’ll be fine. Just don’t get out of the car or respond to anything the ghosts say, and you won’t have any problems.”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>“And don’t look back unnecessarily. If you look back on your way, you might get possessed.”</p>, <p>“No, just a moment! Wait!”</p>, <p>“Ah, why worry? Most of them will follow me anyway. You just need to make a U-turn, close your eyes, and drive straight ahead.”</p>, <p>They were drawn by the effect of the [Feast Offering].</p>, <p>Even without that, the overflowing magical power in my body was an irresistibly attractive prey for the ghosts. They would likely follow me instead of Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p><em>Haaah, it’s a bit disappointing. If Jang Hyeon-deok had followed me a bit longer, it would have been much easier to proceed.</em></p>, <p>“No, that’s not it. I won’t be turning back.”</p>, <p>“What?”</p>, <p>“You may not think much of me, but I’m a professional.”</p>, <p>Looking at him, I noticed something different in Jang Hyeon-deok’s eyes.</p>, <p>It’s not that the fear or mental shock has disappeared.</p>, <p>Determination, resolve, and a bit of unnecessary stubbornness were mixed in his gaze.</p>, <p>“I’ve been driving through this crazy city, dodging bullets for six years now.”</p>, <p>“And your point?”</p>, <p>“My job is to take my clients to the destinations they’ve requested. Don’t interfere with my work.”</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>What is this guy rambling about?</p>, <p>It’d be better if he just left, it’s more troublesome with him around.</p>, <p><em>…Though it’s a bit hard to say that out loud.</em></p>, <p>Then again, it would be much easier if Jang Hyeon-deok kept driving.</p>, <p>“Ah, forget it. Do as you wish.”</p>, <p>“Yesss!”</p>, <p>…He sure is happy about it.</p>, <p>“Alright, let’s get ready then.”</p>, <p>After all, it’s not like we have to travel a great distance.</p>, <p>The building was already visible beyond that hill… 5 minutes? No, maybe about 10 minutes?</p>, <p>If it were a well-maintained road, it would take less than 3 minutes.</p>, <p>Given the unpredictable circumstances…</p>, <p>I further enhanced the distortion field enveloping the car with my magical power.</p>, <p>[Spell Amplification: Maximization]</p>, <p><em>Buzzzzzzzzz…</em></p>, <p>The range of the distortion field expanded to about a 5-meter radius.</p>, <p>Next, I activated various detection spells.</p>, <p>[Magic Detection], [Sound Detection], [Life Detection], [Spirit Detection], [Curse Detection], [Temperature Detection], [Invisibility Detection]…</p>, <p>“What a pain in the ass.”</p>, <p>There were a few patterns to this quest.</p>, <p>The most common was the pattern where invisible ghosts appeared first.</p>, <p>Otherwise, it’s the pattern where entities possess human bodies.</p>, <p>From afar, the faint cries of ghosts could be heard.</p>, <p><em>– Aaaahhhh…</em></p>, <p><em>– Together… together…</em></p>, <p><em>– Let’s die together… so lonely…</em></p>, <p>At the moment, the current pattern was one in which ghosts appear.</p>, <p>Spirits with malevolent intent writhed within the unseen darkness.</p>, <p><em>Would it have been dangerous if I hadn’t stopped to detect them around here?</em></p>, <p>It seemed that the ghosts of those who had met their end in the mountains, the souls of animals, and various wandering spirits from the vicinity had all converged here.</p>, <p><em>Last time, in that place where only a zombie or two should have emerged, over thirty appeared, along with a giant zombie that was supposed to appear elsewhere.</em></p>, <p>“No choice then.”</p>, <p>“Is-is there a problem?”</p>, <p>“It seems all the wandering spirits in this mountain have gathered.”</p>, <p>“What should I do?”</p>, <p>“Just be careful and drive well.”</p>, <p>[Ibn Ghazi’s Beacon]</p>, <p><em>Paaaaaaaaa—</em></p>, <p>A lump of burning light appeared in an ethereal form in front of the vehicle.</p>, <p>“I’ll block those that charge at us.”</p>, <p>It was a magic that revealed the forms of those without substance.</p>, <p>The lesser ones couldn’t even approach.</p>, <p>Issues like the invisible ghost earlier, suddenly leaping out and crashing into the car, could be prevented.</p>, <p><em>And a few other things besides that.</em></p>, <p>[Prayer of Protection]</p>, <p>[Protective Circle]</p>, <p>[Power Expulsion]</p>, <p>“This should suffice.”</p>, <p>“Th-that’s great!”</p>, <p>Oh, there’s one problem left though.</p>, <p>If Jang Hyeon-deok who was holding the steering wheel lost his mind, there would be a major accident.</p>, <p>The car began to move.</p>, <p><em>This is beyond my control.</em></p>, <p>Even I lack magic to prevent distortion.</p>, <p>Isn’t there some spell to instill a sort of baseless courage in him?</p>, <p>Among the rituals of cultists, there were such practices.</p>, <p>But those were actually meant to induce madness which would create something akin to berserk warriors.</p>, <p>Such a spell wasn’t appropriate for use now.</p>, <p>The sounds of the car navigating the bumpy road filled the air.</p>, <p>Intermingled with these were the faint sounds of ghostly laughter.</p>, <p><em>Chijichik… Chijijijijik…</em></p>, <p>The radio turned on by itself.</p>, <p>Strange shapes writhed in the pitch-black void.</p>, <p>“This is turning more into a horror show by the minute.”</p>, <p>As the mansion drew closer, the paranormal activity intensified.</p>, <p>[System: The penalty trait ‘Feast Offering’ has been activated.]</p>, <p>Wasn’t it activated earlier?

Screeeech, Boom!</em></p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok’s hands and feet moved with dazzling speed.</p>, <p>He actually accelerated and started navigating the car in an almost acrobatic fashion to dodge every obstacle.</p>, <p>“Ah… Didn’t I tell you I’m a professional?”</p>, <p>Even as he trembled, Jang Hyeon-deok more than held his own.</p>, <p>“Yeah, buddy.

Shall we get down to business?”</p>, <p>The stairs leading to the mansion’s entrance were slippery with moss and clearly neglected.</p>, <p><em>This place hasn’t been maintained at all.</em></p>, <p><em>Biiiiii—</em></p>, <p>When I rang the old bell next to the front door, I heard a creepy electronic sound.</p>, <p>“I’ll need to replace this bell too…”</p>, <p>Despite pressing the bell, no one came out, so I had to ring the bell again several times.</p>, <p>After a while, I finally heard some movement from deep within the mansion.</p>, <p><em>Creeeeak…</em></p>, <p>A young man with a sinister appearance stood before me.</p>, <p>This was the owner of the hungry mansion.</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon welcomed me.</p>, <p>“You’ve finally arrived.”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Standing at the door, Heo Sang-hyeon’s appearance was frankly bizarre.</p>, <p>If Jang Hyeon-deok had seen him, he might have screamed in terror.</p>, <p>This isn’t to say that he had multiple eyes or tentacles sprouting from his body.</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon’s appearance was ordinary.</p>, <p>His age? Roughly in his mid-thirties.</p>, <p>At most, he didn’t seem to surpass his late thirties.</p>, <p>His face, setting aside several issues, could be considered handsome, and his upright posture even conveyed a certain dignity to him.</p>, <p>The issue lay in the ominous aura that seeped from his entire body.</p>, <p>An eerie scent of death.</p>, <p>His skin was as pale as a vampire’s and his overly wide eyes carried a strange madness.</p>, <p>Despite his good looks, this aura made Heo Sang-hyeon seem unpleasant, ominous… and almost monstrous.</p>, <p><em>Isn’t this enough to question his sanity?</em></p>, <p>Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, he exuded the unsettling air of a drug addict or a psychopathic serial killer.</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon who had been silently observing me for quite some time finally spoke.</p>, <p>“I wish to cancel the request.”</p>, <p>His voice cracked like wringing a rotten log.</p>, <p>Wait, what did he say?</p>, <p>“What did you say?”</p>, <p>“Please go back.”</p>, <p>“Are you serious?”</p>, <p>“I’m saying this for your own good.”</p>, <p>A somber emotion swirled in Heo Sang-hyeon’s eyes.</p>, <p>Fear, worry, tension, hesitation, and guilt.</p>, <p>“The situation has changed significantly since I made the request.”</p>, <p>This was rather interesting. It was a completely different turn of events from when I played [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>Now, whether the request was canceled wasn’t the issue.</p>, <p>It’s necessary to find out what went wrong.</p>, <p>“Hmm, instead of that, why don’t you tell me what’s happening in detail?”</p>, <p>As I said this, I stepped towards the stairs in front of the entrance.</p>, <p>“Having come all this way, I can’t just turn back now.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon’s eyes flickered with unease.</p>, <p>“Something, something has awakened. You can’t handle it alone. Monsters have appeared… strange beasts… and just now, continuous terrible explosions were coming from outside the house… it’s all gone wrong…”</p>, <p>In the original game, it was rare for Heo Sang-hyeon to appear in his right mind.</p>, <p><em>Considering that, this is actually quite decent. At least he seems to be concerned about me, right?</em></p>, <p>“Strange beasts, you say… Are you talking about something like this?”</p>, <p>“Like what?”</p>, <p>I gestured behind me with my hand.</p>, <p>Scattered among the overgrown weeds were fragments of a necromancy golem.</p>, <p>Beside them, bright red stuff that wasn’t clear whether it was blood or bodily fluids was mixed with the pouring rain to form a red puddle.</p>, <p>When he saw this scene, Heo Sang-hyeon shuddered and stepped back slightly.</p>, <p>“Ugh?! What in the world is that?”</p>, <p>“It used to be a bear. Over there, do you see that?”</p>, <p>I pointed at one of the larger pieces of the necromancy golem.</p>, <p>It was what used to be the bear’s head.</p>, <p>Though it was completely destroyed, it wasn’t beyond recognition.</p>, <p>“That is…!”</p>, <p>“It seems to have come from this mansion. Are these the monsters that appeared today?”</p>, <p>“You dealt with this…? You fixer-nim took care of it?”</p>, <p>Ah, I’m starting to understand.</p>, <p>Just because the progression of the game has changed doesn’t mean the characters will act according to the system.</p>, <p>From Heo Sang-hyeon’s point of view, it seemed he was frightened when the taxidermies on the second floor suddenly began to move, and then he was startled by various noises.</p>, <p>“Unbelievable… That’s amazing….?”</p>, <p>“This isn’t the first time something like this has happened, is it?”</p>, <p>“Yes, that’s right. But something this big has never moved before…”</p>, <p>“If we leave it be, more incidents will occur in the future.”</p>, <p>“That’s true.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon’s expression subtly shifted.</p>, <p>He didn’t have a “Wow, this guy is amazing!” look on his face, but instead his face was a mix of doubt, fear, and tension.</p>, <p>It was quite a peculiar look for someone gazing at their rescuer.</p>, <p>“I’d like to deal with the things inside the house too. May I go in?”</p>, <p>“Yes? Oh, yes, I understand. Please come in.”</p>, <p>I shrugged my shoulders slightly and followed Heo Sang-hyeon into the entrance.</p>, <p>As soon as I set foot in the mansion, a transparent square obscured my view.</p>, <p><em>Whoosh—</em></p>, <p>It was a message window.</p>, <p>[Quest Information Update</p>, <p>&lt;Secure Base Quest: The Hungry Mansion&gt; Subdue all the evil spirits haunting the mansion and return it to a ‘safe’ state.</p>, <p>First Objective (Cleared): Investigate the first floor of the mansion to uncover ‘The Truth of the Mansion’.</p>, <p>Third Objective (Cleared): Eliminate the attacking ghosts and corpse golems.</p>, <p>Second Objective: Purify the mansion.</p>, <p>Fourth Objective: Defeat ‘The Master of the Mansion’.</p>, <p>Reward: 250,000XP + Ownership of the Mansion</p>, <p>Failure: Possession by an evil spirit.]</p>, <p><em>The quest status is strange.</em></p>, <p>First off, the reversal of the second and third objectives was concerning.</p>, <p>It seems like starting by defeating the necromancy golem outside has caused some sort of issue with the system.</p>, <p>Feels like a bug in this buggy game.</p>, <p>[Cthulhu World] had always been a game rife with bugs.</p>, <p>This level of bug was hardly worth noting.</p>, <p><em>Anyway, it’s not like there will be any problems with the process…</em></p>, <p>Let’s think positively.</p>, <p>The real issue was the unpredictability of when and how bugs would manifest.</p>, <p><em>Stop blocking my view, just go away already.</em></p>, <p>I waved my hand and dismissed the message window.</p>, <p>Finally, I could properly inspect the interior of the mansion.</p>, <p>Right next to the entrance door was a short corridor, and in the order they came into view were the living room, drawing room, kitchen, and dining room.</p>, <p>And tucked in a corner was a staircase leading to the second floor.</p>, <p><em>There’s no need to head upstairs yet.</em></p>, <p>Normally, one would scour the mansion for Heo Sang-hyeon’s diary, blueprints, secret documents, and such.</p>, <p>But perhaps because I already knew all the related truths, those tasks were marked as completed.</p>, <p><em>Well, the most annoying part has been skipped, so that’s convenient.</em></p>, <p>I decided to take it easy.</p>, <p>The truths weren’t all that significant.</p>, <p>The circumstances under which Heo Sang-hyeon inherited the house, how his ancestors fell into corruption, who died, and who was sacrificed were all details I didn’t need to bother with.</p>, <p>Since there was no need to investigate, the immediate tasks were clear.</p>, <p><em>First, clear out the things on the first floor, and then deal with the boss hiding on the second floor.</em></p>, <p>I could already hear the bubbling sounds of ghosts.</p>, <p>The tittering laughter.</p>, <p>The screeching sound of something scraping against glass.</p>, <p>And the soft footsteps coming from beyond the ceiling.</p>, <p>“Can you hear that sound?”</p>, <p>“I do… That horrendous sound that never goes away no matter what I do…”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon wrapped his arms around himself as if he was chilled to the bone.</p>, <p>“Even the other fixer who came before couldn’t fix it. You are a fixer, right? Kim Shin-hwa, was it? Can you get rid of it?”</p>, <p>“It’s not hard to get rid of.”</p>, <p>“Then…?”</p>, <p>“There are some things I need to look into first. May I ask you a few questions?”</p>, <p>Hope flickered across Heo Sang-hyeon’s pale face.</p>, <p>“I’ll answer anything I know.”</p>, <p>“How long has this been going on?”</p>, <p>“A month… No, it’s been about 3 years.”</p>, <p>A sense of time stretching from 30 days to about 3 years…</p>, <p>“It started not long after I inherited this mansion.”</p>, <p>“At first, you wanted to operate it as a guesthouse, right?”</p>, <p>“That’s right. It took about a year to get everything ready. Just when I thought we were about to start operating properly, those things started appearing.”</p>, <p>“I see. I understand.”</p>, <p>That should be enough information.</p>, <p>I gestured for Heo Sang-hyeon to follow and walked into the corridor.</p>, <p>With just a few steps, the corridor that should have been straight began to appear eerily twisted and bent.</p>, <p>“Be careful where you step…. there seems to be some sort of optical illusion that could cause you to trip.”</p>, <p>“Optical illusion…. I see.”</p>, <p>If the homeowner says it’s an illusion, then an illusion it must be.</p>, <p>The living room, in keeping with the atmosphere of the mansion, was a space filled with antique decorations and wallpaper…It was a gloomy and dangerous space.</p>, <p>I surveyed the surroundings while standing beside a luxurious sofa made of deep green leather.</p>, <p><em>A rather convincing… haunted house.</em></p>, <p>The living room appeared dark, cramped, and dangerous due to the creepy mist-like malevolent energy enveloping it.</p>, <p>And at the edge of my vision, I could see the shapes of people crawling around.</p>, <p>The forms of ghosts huddled in every shadow.</p>, <p><em>Rumbleee…</em></p>, <p>The lightning and torrential rain pouring outside the large windows only intensified the mansion’s sinister atmosphere.</p>, <p>“That staff, or rather, is it a hook? Are you using magic right now?”</p>, <p>When I turned my head to look at Heo Sang-hyeon, I noticed his gaze fixed on the butcher’s hook hanging at my waist.</p>, <p>No, more precisely, he was looking at the thin lines of magical power extending from the tip of the hook.</p>, <p>I slightly lifted the butcher’s hook and said.</p>, <p>“So you can see this?”</p>, <p>“Ah… I’m not capable of using magic myself. I’ve been told I have a somewhat heightened sensitivity compared to others.”</p>, <p>This too was a form of magical hypersensitivity. If developed further, one might become able to use innate magic like Lee Chang-hyeok, or even become a mage or psychic.</p>, <p>There were still some spells I was maintaining on the car, so it seemed he was bothered by the magical power lines extending from the butcher’s hook.</p>, <p>“I took a taxi here, and I cast a few protective spells on it.”</p>, <p>“On the taxi?”</p>, <p>“Yes. There are ghosts wandering around outside as well.”</p>, <p>“Wait a minute.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon looked incredulous.</p>, <p>“You’re still maintaining those spells? Several of them?”</p>, <p>And? What’s the issue with that?</p>, <p>“For a vehicle, which isn’t exactly small, to be maintained beyond your line of sight… And to maintain the spells over such a distance in such a distorted environment?”</p>, <p>The protective magic itself wasn’t particularly extraordinary but in terms of duration, distance, and scale… it’s not exactly an easy feat for an average mage to maintain.</p>, <p>“Well, that’s how it is.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon’s already pale face turned even paler and his face settled into a complete “I’m shocked” expression.</p>, <p>If he knew exactly what magic I was maintaining, he might just faint.</p>, <p>“Could you step aside for a moment so I can start working?”</p>, <p>“Ah, yes, of course…”</p>, <p>Even after stepping back, Heo Sang-hyeon continued to mutter something under his breath.</p>, <p><em>If you’re going to lie, at least put some effort into acting…</em></p>, <p>Just now, Heo Sang-hyeon was surprised in a way that one couldn’t be unless they knew about magic.</p>, <p>In reality, Heo Sang-hyeon was more than just a case of simple magical hypertrophy. The guy could use magic.</p>, <p>Had he been just an ordinary person with a slightly higher sensitivity to magical power, whatever I did would have merely seemed fascinating to him.</p>, <p>One couldn’t be surprised at the duration of magic, the range of its influence, and the number of spells that could be maintained at the same time unless they knew something about magic.</p>, <p><em>Well, I might be acting like this with him, but I already know everything…</em></p>, <p>After all, I was fully aware of what was emerging here and what secrets lay hidden.</p>, <p>I gestured to Heo Sang-hyeon to step back for a moment.</p>, <p>I then pulled a few items out of the duffel bag I was carrying.</p>, <p>These were items I had acquired from a pawn shop for today.</p>, <p>“Since you know about magic, you must have a rough idea. I’m about to set up a barrier to drive away the ghosts.”</p>, <p>“A barrier… with that?”</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The items I had taken out were salt, red beans, and a few large candles.</p>, <p>“Yes, it’s a traditional method from the East. Combining these can create a basic exorcism barrier.”</p>, <p>“Is…. that so.”</p>, <p>The corners of Heo Sang-hyeon’s mouth twitched. Was he sneering? He seemed to be making an effort to control his expression.</p>, <p>It appeared he knew what I was attempting to create.</p>, <p>Though I had openly referred to it as a basic barrier, this truly was the most elementary of barriers.</p>, <p>Even those without magical power could construct it, but as a result, its effect was quite minimal. He struggled to hold back a laugh as he said,</p>, <p>“Are you sure this will be sufficient…? I’ve seen another fixer create a similar barrier before… but they failed.”</p>, <p>“Well, just watch.”</p>, <p>And then, there was one more item.</p>, <p>A necklace with a large metal disc.</p>, <p>The round metal disc was intricately engraved with complex Sanskrit characters and a depiction of the Big Dipper.</p>, <p>While it was too large to simply be called a necklace, it was indeed designed to be worn around the neck.</p>, <p>It was an immensely valuable item, so much so that my hands slightly trembled when I handed it over to Heo Sang-hyeon.</p>, <p>[Ancient God’s Mirror (A-rank Accessory): An item imbued with the influence of an ancient god and crafted for communication with divine beings.

Do not lose or damage it under any circumstances.”</p>, <p>“What is this?”</p>, <p>“When I begin to formally establish the barrier, the ghosts will start to swarm towards us.”</p>, <p>“Does this protect against the ghosts?”</p>, <p>“Well… it’s better than nothing.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon looked at the Ancient God’s Mirror skeptically.</p>, <p><em>He’s doubtful.</em></p>, <p>But no amount of examination would change its purpose. It was, in fact, an item capable of warding off possession.</p>, <p>Perhaps concluding that wearing it posed no harm, he eventually put the mirror around his neck.</p>, <p>“It feels somewhat strange.”</p>, <p>“That would be due to your sensitivity to magical power.”</p>, <p>This was no mere trinket.</p>, <p>As an artifact that emitted its own magical power, someone sensitive like Heo Sang-hyeon could detect its presence.</p>, <p>“I will now begin the process.”</p>, <p>I scattered salt and beans in each corner of the living room and set up candles before lighting them one by one.</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon, still wearing a face of skepticism, followed me closely.</p>, <p>“I’ve been suddenly attacked by a ghost from behind before.”</p>, <p>He said this as his reason, but I suspected he had another reason for staying so close.</p>, <p>As the number of barriers increased, the atmosphere within the living room began to transform.</p>, <p><em>Woooooooo…..</em></p>, <p>It shifted into a more sinister and dangerous form.</p>, <p>Magic surged and ghosts wailed.</p>, <p>At the same time, Heo Sang-hyeon’s expression gradually turned to one of mounting anxiety.</p>, <p><em>They must be about to start moving, right?</em></p>, <p>The barrier was nearing completion.</p>, <p>Only two more candles needed to be lit.</p>, <p>However, I deliberately dawdled at the last moment and dragged out the time.</p>, <p>Completing the barrier was not my goal.</p>, <p>I had no intention of subduing them by finishing this barrier from the start.</p>, <p>Moreover, as Heo Sang-hyeon mentioned, attacks usually start before the completion of such barriers.</p>, <p>[System: ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ trait has been activated.]</p>, <p>The ‘Enhanced Vigilance’ trait alerted me to the impending danger.</p>, <p>“They’re here.”</p>, <p><em>Woooooooooooooo…..</em></p>, <p>At that moment, the atmosphere began to churn.</p>, <p>A blurred something started to seep through from beyond the walls.</p>, <p>Was it foam?

            "[<p>At that time, there was someone observing Kim Shin-hwa’s figure.</p>, <p>Among the rooms arranged on the second floor of the mansion, this one was the most exceptional.</p>, <p>The dense magical power filled the air to the point of suffocation.</p>, <p>The aura of death was so potent it carried the stench of decay.</p>, <p>The space still bore the presence and influence of a great old being.</p>, <p>This room was indeed the heart of the [Hungry Mansion].</p>, <p>With no form of lighting present, the room was as dark as pitch.</p>, <p>In such a place, someone’s laughter echoed maniacally.</p>, <p>“Kahahahahaha!”</p>, <p>The voice was so distorted it was impossible to tell if it belonged to a man, a woman, an elder, or a youth.</p>, <p>And even more bizarre than the voice was the appearance.</p>, <p>It was impossible to determine its gender or age.</p>, <p>A cursed body that looked like rotting pink flesh forcibly woven over a human skeleton.</p>, <p>If you tried to discern a hint of the person’s former human appearance amidst this ghastly face…you might just realize the repulsive being bore a resemblance to Heo Sang-hyeon.</p>, <p>This was the true master of the [Hungry Mansion].</p>, <p>The “writhing magical power on the second floor” that Kim Shin-hwa had sensed beforehand belonged to him.</p>, <p>He was the owner of the Hungry Mansion, a fallen necromancer, a cultist who worshipped beings of the abyss, a bastard born of a pile of corpses, and a judge of the dark cult that revered darkness and void.</p>, <p>There might have been something akin to a name for him once, but now it holds no significance.</p>, <p>He himself and others simply referred to him as the Hollow Lord.</p>, <p>“Kekkeke… So simple.”</p>, <p>He moved his grotesquely creaking limbs and caressed a large crystal ball placed in front of him.</p>, <p>The crystal ball, under the Hollow Lord’s will, displayed scenes from locations he wished to see.</p>, <p>It showed Kim Shin-hwa being blasted away by Heo Sang-hyeon’s [Spirit Explosion] spell.</p>, <p>Then, necromancy golems dispatched by the Hollow Lord poured out of the staircase connected to the second floor.</p>, <p>Monsters of bizarre appearance, these were not mere taxidermies but specially crafted creatures of a different class.</p>, <p><em>Clatter, clatter,</em></p>, <p>They had heads fashioned from rattling kettles and glass bottles.</p>, <p>Their torsos clumsily wrapped in bedcovers moved awkwardly.</p>, <p>Their joints creaked and jolted in an awkward manner.</p>, <p>In place of arms and legs protruded scythes, hammers, and hand axes.</p>, <p>Bizarrely shaped artificial humans that appeared to have been created by tying together random items moved awkwardly while imitating human movements.</p>, <p>As part of a glass bottle cracked, a ghastly set of teeth made from sharp glass shards was revealed.</p>, <p>The crystal ball continued to show Kim Shin-hwa, cornered and resisting.</p>, <p>[Water Blade]</p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa harnessed the overflowing rainwater outside the window and created large blades and waves.</p>, <p><em>Crash! Boom, boom, boom!</em></p>, <p>The surging water pressure shattered the necromancy golems and their composite bodies broke apart.</p>, <p>The Hollow Lord was unable to contain himself and burst into laughter again at the sight.</p>, <p>“Kekkeke… The mage struggles like a bug.”</p>, <p>After all, these bodies were just assembled pieces of various parts.</p>, <p>Although they were lacking in stability and durability, they possessed remarkable regenerative abilities.</p>, <p><em>Creak, click-clack. </em></p>, <p>The shattered necromancy golems weaved together the random items scattered everywhere to form new bodies.</p>, <p>In this process, a single golem could be split into two smaller entities or several could combine into one larger form.</p>, <p>Of course, all this power and formidable might didn’t come without a cost.</p>, <p>“Ugh…”</p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa’s resistance was more fierce than expected, and more magical power was drained away in an instant than anticipated.</p>, <p>Such was the flaw of the necromancy golems.</p>, <p>They moved on their own with independent thinking without the need for detailed control, but they could whimsically drain their master’s magical power when needed.</p>, <p>Therefore, it was common to control only a limited number at once, but the number of necromancy golems the Hollow Lord was commanding had already exceeded thirty.</p>, <p>This was because the Hollow Lord had a way to offset the drawbacks of these inefficient servants.</p>, <p>Twisting his grotesque body, the Hollow Lord began to pray to the entity he served.</p>, <p>“Iä! Iä! char Buh All’en Sugh, Ash! Van!”</p>, <p>“O great spirit who comes from the darkness, eternal prisoner locked in the abyss, leader of suffocation, ruler of the night, and the darkest one in the heart of the abyss.”</p>, <p>The [Eternal Prisoner], [Leader of Suffocation], or [He Who Comes from the Darkness]— these were all epithets for the same being.</p>, <p>“And to me, your humble servant, you have granted the great flesh, my father.”</p>, <p>The great being from the abyss responded to the Hollow Lord’s prayers and bestowed upon him new power.</p>, <p>Then, from the deepest depths of the abyss, a whisper came.</p>, <p><strong>Bring forth the feast offering.</strong></p>, <p>This was already the third time today.</p>, <p>The command was the same.</p>, <p>Bring forth the feast offering. Kim Shin-hwa’s soul.</p>, <p>The Hollow Lord found it hard to conceal his bewilderment at the command of his mighty father.</p>, <p><em>What value could there possibly be in the soul of that mage?</em></p>, <p>Never before had such a vast amount of magical power been bestowed to him by his father without any conditions.</p>, <p>Why would [He Who Comes from the Darkness] a great old being and one of those who belong to the abyss, bestow so much of his blessing to capture a mere mage?</p>, <p>Yet, for the Hollow Lord, the demand from [He Who Comes from the Darkness] was akin to a divine revelation.</p>, <p>Brushing aside the flicker of doubt that had surfaced in his mind, he bowed his head in reverence.</p>, <p>Then, regaining his composure, the Hollow Lord began to move his fingers in a familiar manner.</p>, <p>His movements resembled those of a puppeteer manipulating a marionette.</p>, <p>It was a gesture to command Heo Sang-hyeon, the finest of the necromancy golems he had created.</p>, <p>“O my descendants, my witnesses to my deeds… fulfill the command bestowed by the great Leader of Suffocation.”</p>, <p>As Kim Shin-hwa was cornered, Heo Sang-hyeon once again activated a spell from his necromancy magic.</p>, <p>[Spirit Explosion]</p>, <p><em>Whoooooooooooom!</em></p>, <p>A sound that seemed less like an explosion and more like someone’s scream of agony.</p>, <p>It was a magical explosion fueled by the spirits of several earthbound ghosts.</p>, <p>Inside the crystal ball, Kim Shin-hwa was caught in the horrific blast, which tore off one of his arms.</p>, <p>“Oh dear…. try to retrieve him in one piece if possible.”</p>, <p>Surrounded by necromancy golems, Kim Shin-hwa was soon to meet a gruesome end.</p>, <p>Even if “He Who Comes from the Darkness” claimed his soul, his body would remain.</p>, <p>The Hollow Lord twisted his facial muscles in anticipation of the monstrous creation he could craft from Kim Shin-hwa’s body.</p>, <p>His face contorted into a hideous smile as his rotten flesh curled.</p>, <p>Then, a new message reached his mind.</p>, <p><em>– We found the medium.</em></p>, <p>It was a message from the spirits sent to pursue Jang Hyeon-deok, the driver brought by Kim Shin-hwa.</p>, <p>“Ah, have they found that medium?”</p>, <p>A genius medium with the trait of a [Living Altar] capable of containing any soul, power, or mind, possessing a supernatural ability beyond reality.</p>, <p>For the Hollow Lord personally, this medium was a more valuable resource than Kim Shin-hwa.</p>, <p>Now, Kim Shin-hwa could be left to his dismal death.</p>, <p>“Feel free to harness as much magical power as necessary. If possible, catch him in intact condition.”</p>, <p>the Hollow Lord added a few more instructions to the necromancy golems on the first floor and then manipulated the crystal ball.</p>, <p>Responding to his will, the crystal ball now began to display the location of Jang Hyeon-deok, not Kim Shin-hwa.</p>, <p><em>**</em>*</p>, <p><em>Vrooooom! Screeeech!!</em></p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok’s call van veered off the road before plowing through the underbrush in a wild dash.</p>, <p><em>Bang, bang……!</em></p>, <p>The vehicle continued its descent not on the road but down a mountainside.</p>, <p>Despite the vehicle’s unstable jerks, as if it could flip over at any moment, Jang Hyeon-deok skillfully kept the sliding van under control without reducing speed.</p>, <p>“Ah, damn it… He’s really going to cover the repair costs, right?”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok frowned and checked the rearview mirror.</p>, <p>In the mirror, he saw a pack of beasts in hot pursuit right behind him.</p>, <p>Monsters in the shape of wild dogs.</p>, <p>These were the corpse golems sent by the Hollow Lord.</p>, <p>Although Kim Shin-hwa assured him everything would be fine, a new pack of corpse golems has started to chase after Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p><em>-Gaaaaaaaah!</em></p>, <p>The corpse golems who had just greedily absballed the magical power sent by the Hollow Lord leaped towards the car with surreal strength.</p>, <p>From the perspective of the corpse golems, the range of attacks they could attempt on a moving vehicle was limited.</p>, <p>But this was nothing short of a nightmare for Jang Hyeon-deok who was no different from an ordinary person except for his extraordinary driving ability.</p>, <p>“Ah, this is just too much!”</p>, <p>It wasn’t just any road, but a completely unpaved one, and one that was sloping downward at that.</p>, <p>Accelerating recklessly in such a place was tantamount to suicide.</p>, <p>Despite this, Jang Hyeon-deok’s hands and feet moved swiftly.</p>, <p><em>Click, thud.</em></p>, <p><em>Vroooooom!!</em></p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok’s call van surged forward at an impossible moment and swayed dangerously.</p>, <p><em>Clang!</em></p>, <p>The van nearly flipped over entirely but managed to evade the attacks of the corpse golems.</p>, <p>Shifting gears once again, Jang Hyeon-deok was barely able to put a significant distance between himself and the pursuing horde.</p>, <p>And then… he began to see what he had been searching for up ahead.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok stretched out his right hand to pick up an item placed on the passenger seat.</p>, <p>It was something Kim Shin-hwa had handed to him just before they parted ways.</p>, <p>The small clump appeared to be a forced combination of stone, wood, and metal, intertwined as though by coercion.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok touched the object momentarily but couldn’t comprehend how such different materials had combined.</p>, <p><em>How in the world was this made?</em></p>, <p>Unbeknownst to Jang Hyeon-deok, this item was crafted from fragments of a mask he had previously handed to Kim Shin-hwa.</p>, <p>It was a creation mixed with a few catalysts and the [Brainwave Stones] of the alien parasites, using the mask’s fragments.</p>, <p>Individually, these components held no significant effects, but under Kim Shin-hwa’s magical influence, they merged to form a new power.</p>, <p>Now, it possessed specific abilities as detailed below:</p>, <p>[Resonance Stone (A-rank Magical Tool): A tool capable of transmitting will or magical power to a chosen target. It can also serve as a catalyst for magic or rituals or as an object of proof.</p>, <p>Celestial Message: The owner can convey their will to a desired target. However, to use this ability, one must be capable of mediumship or mental magic.</p>, <p>Will Resonance: It allows for partial sharing of magical power with a designated target. (Current registered target: Kim Shin-hwa) (Re-registration waiting time: 1 day)</p>, <p>※ Creator: Kim Shin-hwa</p>, <p>※ Enhancement Complete]</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok yelled towards the Resonance Stone.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim, can you hear me? It seems like I’ve arrived!”</p>, <p>As soon as he spoke, Kim Shin-hwa’s voice mysteriously began to echo in Jang Hyeon-deok’s mind.</p>, <p><em>– Have you arrived, or does it just seem like you have?</em></p>, <p>Was this really the time for such nitpicking?</p>, <p>Those words almost escaped Jang Hyeon-deok’s lips, but he restrained himself and chose different words instead.</p>, <p>“I have arrived! Just like you said, there’s a huge… water ball, about 50 meters ahead!”</p>, <p><em>– Good job. Get a bit closer. You’re still outside its range.</em></p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok looked ahead with a hint of apprehension.</p>, <p>The giant water ball.</p>, <p>Inside it, corpse golems and spirits that Kim Shin-hwa had previously swept away with [Turbid Current] were entangled in a watery prison made of rain and magical power.</p>, <p><em>– Ah, good. I can feel it. Be careful not to get too close to that water ball, or you’ll be swept up too.</em></p>, <p>“Me too? What should I do?!”</p>, <p><em>– Just circle around the ball! Keep quiet; I need to concentrate!</em></p>, <p>The magical power of Kim Shin-hwa, who still remained in the [Hungry Mansion], traveled through the butcher’s hook and was transmitted to the Resonance Stone.</p>, <p>And the Resonance Stone opened a path for the magical power, imparting a new essence to the prison of Turbid Current.</p>, <p><em>Kwaaaaaah!</em></p>, <p>The prison of turbulent currents began to swirl violently.</p>, <p><em>– I needed to refine it a bit away in a place where that guy’s eyes couldn’t reach.</em></p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa muttered something difficult for Jang Hyeon-deok to understand, then addressed him.</p>, <p><em>– The ones chasing you, I’ll shake them off now. It’s time for you to head back home for real.</em></p>, <p>“Is it over?!”</p>, <p><em>– More or less.</em></p>, <p>The swirling prison of currents distorted before transforming into a ferocious wave that crashed violently.</p>, <p>“Argh!”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok screamed.</p>, <p>Screeeeeeech!</p>, <p>He narrowly avoided being engulfed by the torrential wave that surged with immense force.</p>, <p>The wave that narrowly missed Jang Hyeon-deok’s vehicle swept up the corpse golems that had been pursuing him and then…</p>, <p><em>Whooooooosh!</em></p>, <p><em>Rippleeeeee!</em></p>, <p>It sped towards the [Hungry Mansion] with incredible speed.</p>, <p>“Ah, even if the enemy had ten lives, they wouldn’t be enough in this situation…”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok sighed as he watched the receding wave.</p>, <p><em>Amitabha… I must make a donation at the temple tomorrow…</em></p>, <p><em>**</em>*</p>, <p>“What is this! What on earth is happening?!”</p>, <p>The Hollow Lord screamed in horror as he watched the image of Jang Hyun-deok reflected in the crystal ball.</p>, <p>This makes no sense!</p>, <p>“Kim Shin-hwa, that mage, just a moment ago…!”</p>, <p>Activating his magic, the Hollow Lord changed the scene reflected in the crystal ball.</p>, <p>The first-floor living room of the [Hungry Mansion].</p>, <p>The very place where Kim Shin-hwa had been fighting.</p>, <p>Kim Shin-hwa, with one arm severed and bleeding profusely from all over, lay defeated.</p>, <p>The battle was over.</p>, <p>But the necromancy golems were still clamoring for more magical energy.</p>, <p>The sheer drain of his magical power was dizzying, almost enough to blur his consciousness.</p>, <p>Something’s wrong.

He was just referred to as [</em>Hollow Lord<em>].</em></p>, <p>Although the exact family tree was unknown, if you calculate the number of relatives between the Hollow Lord and Heo Sang-hyeon, he might be roughly a great-grandfather.</p>, <p><em>Or perhaps a great-grandmother… What the hell, is that a man or a woman?</em></p>, <p>“Haah…”</p>, <p>I was now outside the hungry mansion.</p>, <p>More precisely, I was dangling from its second-story window.</p>, <p><em>Rumble….!</em></p>, <p>The sound of lightning falling from the dark sky could be heard.</p>, <p>My frail body was shaking as I was exposed to the rain pouring down from the sky. Yet, observing the Hollow Lord engaging in his odd antics wasn’t entirely unpleasant.</p>, <p>“What, what is this…?!”</p>, <p>That was the Hollow Lord’s voice.</p>, <p>Just like his ancestor.</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon’s voice had also been bizarrely unsettling.</p>, <p>True to his lineage, the Hollow Lord spoke in a voice that was equally eerie and chilling.</p>, <p>Hollow Lord was still peering into the crystal ball and was unable to fully grasp the situation, thanks to the [Hazy Presence] spell that rendered me nearly invisible.</p>, <p>I watched as the Hollow Lord amplified his magical power and began to remove the magical interference embedded in the crystal ball.</p>, <p><em>Ah, I’ve been discovered.</em></p>, <p>I manipulated Heo Sang-hyeon’s mind and vision using the effect of the ancient god’s mirror.</p>, <p>The Hollow Lord was surveying the situation on the first floor through Heo Sang-hyeon’s eyes and was laughing heartily at the distorted images I had conjured.</p>, <p>Since I was discovered, it seemed this was the end of the ruse. The crystal ball would no longer display false images but reveal the actual events unfolding on the mansion’s first floor, right?</p>, <p>“Arghhh! You damned rat!”</p>, <p>In a fit of rage, the Hollow Lord shattered his crystal ball with an unintelligible scream. It was a shame, really; that artifact must have been costly.</p>, <p>“Where are you?

            "[<p>Though reduced to a pile of random parts, the necromancy golems were not completely destroyed. Normally, these parts lay scattered around the house and looked like mere clutter, but upon receiving a command or detecting an intruder, they would reassemble and become operational.</p>, <p>However, some parts still remained embedded in the wall. The center of the wall oddly jutted out with decorations and saws sticking out haphazardly.</p>, <p>“There’s nothing I can do about that.”</p>, <p>The items stuck in the wall couldn’t be removed.</p>, <p>Even in [Cthulhu World], there’s hardly any way to extract items that have become embedded in a wall.</p>, <p>“The easiest method would be a reboot.”</p>, <p>If rebooting were an option, I would have done it already.</p>, <p>That leaves loading from a previous save point or deleting the character to start over from scratch…</p>, <p>As of now, I can’t attempt any of those options.</p>, <p>Therefore, I’ve decided to give up on the parts stuck in the wall.</p>, <p>I planned to leave those stuck in the wall as they were and use the remaining parts for reconstruction.</p>, <p>Even with this method, those whose cores were stuck couldn’t be reconstructed.</p>, <p>“Guess I’ll have to give up on those.”</p>, <p>Though the number of components would significantly decrease, it really didn’t matter since I wasn’t planning to play as a so-called gangster mage, which was a build that involved leading a large number of summoned creatures.</p>, <p>“Before reassembling, let’s fix this inefficient spell that indiscriminately draws magical power.”</p>, <p>I approached a nearby magic circle and reset the spell that composed the bodies of the necromancy golems.</p>, <p>As I touched the glowing magic circles suspended in the air and manipulated the spells…For some reason, it reminded me of a sci-fi movie I watched before I was trapped in this world.</p>, <p>It actually felt quite similar.</p>, <p>I would pull on the magic circle to enlarge it, rotate it, throw it, and pull it.</p>, <p>I had never been taught how to handle or reconstruct these spells.</p>, <p>But it wasn’t hard; I was quickly getting the hang of manipulating the spells.</p>, <p>“It’s somewhat similar to coding.”</p>, <p>The feeling was akin to writing code to move a robot.</p>, <p>Of course, I had never seen code for programming a robot or any other kind of programming.</p>, <p>However, by reading this spell, it seemed I could understand how to control and manage the movements of a robot in the real world.</p>, <p><em>I might be able to code with just a little more learning.</em></p>, <p>I had only briefly interacted with the spell.</p>, <p>Just by channeling magical power into the spell and slightly tinkering with its structure, I learned how to handle, control, and adjust them.</p>, <p>“Something like this…”</p>, <p><em>Rumbleeeee….</em></p>, <p>The spell was transformed according to my will and the magical power began to move along the newly created path.</p>, <p>“Oh, it works. Now I’m certain.”</p>, <p>Indeed, I seemed capable of almost anything with high intelligence.</p>, <p>If I had maxed out strength instead… well, that would have been convenient in its own way, but this kind of work definitely required a different stat.</p>, <p>“I wish I could keep my intelligence stat even if I return to the original world.”</p>, <p>Honestly, I’m not even hoping for magic.</p>, <p>Is there no way to maintain my intelligence stat even if I lose my magical abilities when I return to reality?</p>, <p>The ability to never forget anything once I’ve seen it, and to understand anything instantly, is truly remarkable.</p>, <p>The speed at which I understand, analyze, and learn things is incredibly fast.</p>, <p>I quickly found a way to fix the existing issues in the spell.</p>, <p>However, instead of just improving the parts that were immediately visible, I decided to check a wider range.</p>, <p>The spell that moved the necromancy golems appeared like a precisely functioning mechanical device.</p>, <p>Each spell and the patterns of magical power moved organically. They formed a structure that seemed interdependent…</p>, <p>But isn’t it said that the more you know, the more you see? As my understanding deepened, I began to see parts of the spell that needed improvement.</p>, <p>No, it wasn’t just a matter of degree…</p>, <p>“What is this? It’s completely messed up?”</p>, <p>It only looked plausible on the surface.</p>, <p>In reality, it was an extremely inefficient and haphazardly functioning spell. It even included conventionally placed decorations and useless formalities that hindered the efficiency of the structure.</p>, <p>No wonder it moved so chaotically.</p>, <p>The contingency patterns to be used in emergencies or when problems arose were also grossly inadequate.</p>, <p>Although pre-written response patterns existed, they were as simplistic as characters from an old video game.</p>, <p>“What have you been doing for 150 years, exactly?”</p>, <p>Just a slight modification of the spell could have made it much more efficient and intelligent in its movements; why was it made into such a mess?</p>, <p><em>I was just going to improve the parts where it mindlessly consumed magical power…</em></p>, <p>Eventually, I started to spend more time than planned on improving the spell.</p>, <p>Each time I checked the content and applied improvements, new methods came to mind.</p>, <p>Inspiration kept flowing.</p>, <p>In the end, I recreated everything except the original framework of the spell.</p>, <p>It was a lot of work, but it was worth the effort.</p>, <p>This is not the end. The knowledge I have learned and realized now can be directly applied to other fields as well.</p>, <p>It seemed I could create something entirely new that had never appeared in [Cthulhu World] before.</p>, <p>There was no need to stick to such a form; I could opt for something that moved with lighter resources…</p>, <p>“Ugh, but I can’t spend all day just on this…”</p>, <p>Nevertheless, I had achieved my original goal. I had fixed all the noticeable errors, improved the safety mechanisms, and completely revamped the inefficient design.</p>, <p>As a result, I created a structure that reduced magical power consumption by a tenth and nearly tripled the intelligence of the necromancy golems.</p>, <p>“This is all for now.”</p>, <p>I stretched out my hands and made a pushing gesture to push the magic circles away.</p>, <p>The magic circles floating in the air moved in sync with my actions and scattered toward the cluster of items around them.</p>, <p>And then, a reboot.</p>, <p>No, I mean an awakening.</p>, <p>“Now, wake up.”</p>, <p><em>Click, click, click, crackle.</em></p>, <p>The collapsed necromancy golems began to reassemble themselves in perfect order and stood up.</p>, <p>It was a sight to behold.</p>, <p>The number had significantly decreased.</p>, <p><em>Thirteen.</em></p>, <p>That number again? Although it was a number that no longer had any meaning to me, the residual feelings from the troubles I had endured left me having no good feelings for it.</p>, <p>The reduction in number was not a major issue. If needed, I could create more of the same golems.</p>, <p>However, unless there was a special problem, I probably wouldn’t bother making that type of necromancy golems again.</p>, <p>I had once raised a necromancer character before, and creating the same would require a tremendous amount of time and resources.</p>, <p>Especially the engine, if one could call it that? The core of the structure required a specially purified human soul.</p>, <p>Moreover, it needed materials so horrific they were socially unacceptable.</p>, <p>There was no reason to create more since there were better alternatives available at a lower cost and risk.</p>, <p>Furthermore…..thirteen was already too many.</p>, <p>After all, they would only serve as house guardians for the foreseeable future.</p>, <p>“Well, at least the magical power consumption is stable…”</p>, <p>Their movements were normal.</p>, <p>“Alright, there’s no need for now, so just disperse.”</p>, <p><em>Clatter……! Clatter!</em></p>, <p>The necromancy golems dispersed and transformed back into various objects and furniture throughout the mansion.</p>, <p>I looked around the now silent living room.</p>, <p>Although the necromancy golems had been put away, the living room was in worse shape. The ceiling was scorched by fire magic. Unsightly bits and pieces jutted out from the walls. Furniture was randomly placed and lost their proper spots.</p>, <p>These were problems, but there was a bigger problem.</p>, <p>Years of being known as a haunted house had accumulated dust, negative energy, evil magic, and ghosts.</p>, <p>This may not have been a problem when it was a den of the undead. But it was still not fit for a human who needed to breathe and eat.</p>, <p>“I’d like to start with cleaning, but there’s still an issue to resolve.”</p>, <p>I summoned magical power and snapped my fingers.</p>, <p>[Invisible Hand]</p>, <p><em>Buzzzzz!</em></p>, <p>Invisible hands materialized around me.</p>, <p>They soared towards a corner of the living room and dragged a collapsed person to my side.</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>Something human-like, held aloft by the invisible hands.</p>, <p>It was Heo Sang-hyeon.</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon was unconscious and his body was limp.</p>, <p>I checked the state of the [Ancient God’s Mirror] hanging around his neck.</p>, <p>[Ancient God’s Mirror (A-rank Accessory): An item imbued with the influence of an ancient god and crafted for communication with divine beings. It possesses the power to suppress malevolent forces and avert disasters.</p>, <p>Heavenly Lightning: Blocks possession effects and diminishes the influence of outer gods.</p>, <p>Heavenly Perspective: Provides the ability to see in darkness with enhanced vision and increases sight by 100%.</p>, <p>Heavenly Divine Qi: Automatically casts the ‘Healing Meditation’ spell on a chosen target and increases the effect of rest by 100%.</p>, <p>Heavenly Malevolent Miasma: Automatically casts a ‘Powerful Hallucination’ spell on a chosen target and enhances sensitivity to magic and divine power.</p>, <p>※ Creator: Kim Shin-hwa</p>, <p>※ Further enhancement possible]</p>, <p>I had no idea that an item created as a makeshift solution for a good night’s sleep could do so much.</p>, <p>As soon as Heo Sang-hyeon attacked me, the mirror’s power “Heavenly Malevolent Miasma” was activated and cast illusions.</p>, <p>Thanks to that, I was able to deceive Hollow Lord who had been extracting information from the first floor through Heo Sang-hyeon.</p>, <p>“What on earth should I do with this guy?”</p>, <p>This wasn’t part of the plan.</p>, <p>During my playthrough of [Cthulhu World], Heo Sang-hyeon would have attained Buddhahood at this point automatically. There was no need to think about anything and I would just wish that he may rest in peace.</p>, <p>But despite the resolution of all events, Heo Sang-hyeon was still alive this time.</p>, <p>Furthermore…</p>, <p>“Ownership and control? Over this man?”</p>, <p>Like the necromancy golems, the rights to control and manage Heo Sang-hyeon were granted to me along with the ownership of this mansion.</p>, <p>After analyzing Heo Sang-hyeon’s condition, the messages appearing on the screen, and the information available in the mansion, I began to understand what exactly was happening.</p>, <p>“So… the mirror is more powerful than I expected, and that’s what led to this situation?”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon was originally a dead person.</p>, <p>He had lived elsewhere but came to Paju to inherit the mansion where he met Hollow Lord and died.</p>, <p>Hollow Lord who was in need of an assistant to help him with his rituals and social status resurrected the soul of the deceased Heo Sang-hyeon by returning it to his body and thus reviving him as an undead.</p>, <p>And so it was at the moment of Hollow Lord’s death that the spell was broken, leading to his liberation.</p>, <p>The problem now was that Ancient God’s Mirror which possessed the power to prevent possession was instead preventing the soul from leaving Heo Sang-hyeon’s body.</p>, <p>Furthermore, the spell cast on his physical form was still active which automatically transferred his ownership and control to me.</p>, <p>“So, structurally… if I retrieve this Ancient God’s Mirror, he’ll die immediately?”</p>, <p>On the other hand, if I don’t retrieve it, he can live a bit longer.</p>, <p>Another concern was that he was an undead created in a different manner from the necromancy golems.</p>, <p>“This is… not so much created as it is bound by a contract for servitude.”</p>, <p>The contract’s spell allows control over will and thought, but fundamentally, it operates autonomously according to the individual’s self-consciousness.</p>, <p>In other words, Heo Sang-hyeon had been in a state of living consciousness all this time.</p>, <p>He had been drawing in fixers according to Hollow Lord’s commands.</p>, <p>It might be considered a wrongdoing… But does that make Heo Sang-hyeon a villain?</p>, <p>Against his will, he had to attract victims who were then disassembled or used as sacrifices in rituals.</p>, <p>I scratched my head for a moment, then directed a command towards one of the pieces of furniture in the living room.</p>, <p>“Hey, wake up. Just you.”</p>, <p>As soon as the command was issued, the furniture around started to levitate.</p>, <p><em>Creak, snap, crackle!</em></p>, <p>A necromancy golem swiftly assembled a humanoid torso and approached.</p>, <p>“Put this guy on the bunk bed upstairs.”</p>, <p>I raised my hand and pointed at Heo Sang-hyeon.</p>, <p><em>Crick.</em></p>, <p>The necromancy golem silently nodded its head and hoisted the limp Heo Sang-hyeon before carrying him upstairs.</p>, <p>“Maybe we’ll have a chat when he wakes up.”</p>, <p>After all, if he’s kept alive, there might be some use for him.</p>, <p>Is this a rough wrap-up of what needed to be urgently taken care of?</p>, <p>I slowly walked through the first floor again while looking around the living room, the hallway, and the reception room.</p>, <p><em>The interior is overly old-fashioned, but that’s all in the decorating.</em></p>, <p>Nonetheless, I liked the mansion.</p>, <p><em>I do need to check the basement, though…</em></p>, <p>As I thought this, I moved a little closer to where the basement was.</p>, <p>At that moment…</p>, <p>[System: There are still unexplored areas within the base.

            "[<p>Soon, a new development occurred.</p>, <p><em>Thud!</em></p>, <p>A dull sound like something falling over came from beyond the basement door.</p>, <p>“Hmm…”</p>, <p>In truth, I already knew what was in the basement.</p>, <p>I could simply storm down there and smash everything to bits…</p>, <p>“It seems as if it’s urging me to enter the basement? Am I wrong?”</p>, <p>[System: There are still unexplored areas within the base.

Really.”</p>, <p>I had planned to handle it as slowly as possible because it was so annoying, but it seemed like… if I left whatever was in the basement alone, it might cause some trouble.</p>, <p>As if to encourage such thoughts, the message window was displayed again.</p>, <p>[System: There are still unexplored areas within the base.

If we’re going to do this, let’s do it quickly.”</p>, <p>I slowly opened the basement door while stretching my neck joints.</p>, <p>Downward the dark staircase stretched before me.</p>, <p>As I descended the stairs, I activated a spell with each step I took.</p>, <p>[Fox’s Agility]</p>, <p>[Bear’s Willpower]</p>, <p>[Cat’s Elegance]</p>, <p>[Eagle’s Eye]</p>, <p>[Bull’s Charge]</p>, <p>[Lion’s Courage]</p>, <p><em>I don’t know what variables the [Feast Offering] trait might cause…</em></p>, <p>I couldn’t afford to be careless.</p>, <p>A bizarre problem could arise at the most unexpected moment.</p>, <p>Below me, a thick wooden door had been reinstalled at the base of the basement stairs</p>, <p><em>Creak… Thunk.</em></p>, <p>Strange noises came from beyond it.</p>, <p>I stopped and stayed still for a moment and then it became quiet again. I could sense not even the slightest hint of a creature trying to hide.</p>, <p><em>Oh, how cute, so very cute.</em></p>, <p>Creeeeak…</p>, <p>The heavy wooden door creaked open, emitting an unsettling noise from the hinges.</p>, <p>I held onto the door and peered into the room.</p>, <p><em>It’s dark in here.</em></p>, <p>Like any other place in the hungry mansion, the basement was extremely dark.</p>, <p>For the moment, I couldn’t see what was inside.</p>, <p>So the first thing I noticed was the strange smell.</p>, <p>I had encountered a similar scent before.</p>, <p>It was the smell of chemicals used to prevent decay.</p>, <p>However, there was an even more unpleasant odor, worse than the harsh chemicals.</p>, <p>Even someone who did not understand what this smell implied would feel discomfort enough to be on guard.</p>, <p>Had I still been living in the peaceful reality of my past, I might not have recognized it but I had already encountered this smell twice before.</p>, <p>Once in the Helistic’s secret facility, filled with zombies,</p>, <p>And again at the abandoned hospital of Gamaksan Mountain where horrific deeds were committed by Je Mu-Gyeong.</p>, <p>It was the smell of blood and decaying corpses.</p>, <p>Probably the dreadful residue of hundreds, perhaps thousands of deaths over a very long time.</p>, <p>I activated my magic to enhance my vision.</p>, <p>[Moonlight Vision]</p>, <p>As the magical sight that could pierce through darkness activated, the interior of the basement began to reveal itself.</p>, <p>Although it was a space that could only be called a basement, it was not cramped.</p>, <p>Unlike other floors divided into rooms, this was a large open space, almost like an auditorium with no walls separating it.</p>, <p>The vast area was filled with ominous objects.</p>, <p>Old bloodstains, piles of bones on the floor, hides of beasts, and unpleasant remnants of some creature that were unidentifiable as to which part they belonged.</p>, <p>Shelves were stacked with samples and chemicals, walls hung with bizarre tapestries and unidentifiable ritual tools, and bookshelves filled with magical tomes.</p>, <p>This place was an altar where the Hollow Lord conducted blasphemous rituals and simultaneously a magical laboratory where evil experiments were performed.</p>, <p>I turned my head again to further inspect the inside of the room.</p>, <p>The Hollow Lord’s research was of no concern to me.</p>, <p>Of course, there were many things to take care of and examine but those were issues for the future.</p>, <p>Right now, there was only one thing I needed to inspect.</p>, <p>The altar.</p>, <p>It was an old altar located at the very back of the room.</p>, <p>It was about the size of a small bed and stood taller than a person’s waist.</p>, <p>It was a heavy object that was carved from a single large block of granite.</p>, <p>It was sufficiently large to perform rituals for [He Who Comes from the Darkness] or to disassemble captured sacrifices.</p>, <p>There was also an altar in the basement of Unjeong Station for the [Living Flame].</p>, <p>The rituals performed there must have been full of fire and smoke, but here, the rituals would have been more direct and provoking.</p>, <p>Blood splattered, flesh was cut away… It was a ritual of slaughter.</p>, <p>Next to the altar, there was an awkwardly placed large chest.</p>, <p>Unlike the other furniture and equipment that were neatly aligned with each other, this large box was out of place and askew.</p>, <p><em>No, it feels awkward to call it a chest or a box.</em></p>, <p>Since it was made of stone, it should be called a stone coffin.</p>, <p>Whether it was a chest or a stone coffin, it was a very large item. Although smaller than the adjacent altar, the stone coffin was still large enough to easily contain a person if necessary.</p>, <p>I slowly approached the stone coffin and bent down.</p>, <p>In the center of the stone coffin was a groove that allowed it to open vertically.</p>, <p>There was also a huge hinge attached to the back of the stone coffin.</p>, <p>And on the surface, there were intricate and beautiful patterns engraved.</p>, <p>These patterns were not mere decorations.</p>, <p>They were magic circles that were intricately etched with extreme precision and advanced technology.</p>, <p><em>This isn’t the Hollow Lord’s handiwork.</em></p>, <p>When I played the game, I had never been interested in the origins of such things.</p>, <p>I had seen decorations and craftsmanship but I lacked the capacity to understand them.</p>, <p>Now, the world appeared differently to me.</p>, <p>With a surreal perspective and heightened analytical skills, I could immediately grasp details that I didn’t at all during gameplay.</p>, <p>It was an ancient object.</p>, <p>It existed on this planet long before the human race had learned to handle fire.</p>, <p>Just as I was slowly reaching out towards it—</p>, <p><em>Bang!</em></p>, <p>The lid of the stone coffin suddenly opened.</p>, <p>No, “lid” is not the right word.</p>, <p>It was the mouth of the stone coffin.</p>, <p><em>Clatter, crash!</em></p>, <p>The stone coffin which was unmistakably made of rock shook its bulky and rough body violently as it charged towards me.</p>, <p>It tried to engulf me with its gaping mouth!</p>, <p>“Fu*k…. off!”</p>, <p>[Leap]</p>, <p><em>Whoosh!</em></p>, <p>I activated a leap spell and jumped back dramatically.</p>, <p>The stone coffin snapped viciously at the space where I had just been.</p>, <p><em>Craaash!</em></p>, <p>The impact was tremendous.</p>, <p>I could almost see the air trembling.</p>, <p>The stone coffin that was made of a huge raw stone possessed a force far greater than its immense mass.</p>, <p>Since I had anticipated it, dodging was not difficult.</p>, <p>Had I been caught off guard, my body would have been completely crushed within its gaping maw.</p>, <p>“This bastard!”</p>, <p>The stone coffin did not stop.</p>, <p>It was nothing more than a large mouth and a heavy body, yet this artifact was powerful enough to possess a will of its own.</p>, <p>I could feel the emotions it harbored: anger, wariness, confusion, and killing intent.</p>, <p>Riding the momentum of its previous charge, it attacked again.</p>, <p><em>Bang!</em></p>, <p>I dodged the brute’s attack and scanned the interior of the basement.</p>, <p><em>Boom! Bang!</em></p>, <p>But there was simply no time to do anything.</p>, <p>The stone coffin attacked with the ferocity of an enraged wild animal.</p>, <p>“Ah, come on! Just stay still!”</p>, <p>[Grasp of the Dead]</p>, <p>A magic circle with sinister light illuminated the dark basement.</p>, <p>At the same time, the trait [Proof of Slaughter] embedded in the Butcher’s Hooks activated. The necromancy magic circle I summoned was infused with even more malice and madness.</p>, <p>This was a third-order necromancy spell. The spirits of those unjustly deceased that lingered nearby were drawn to my magic circle and generated greater power.</p>, <p><em>Gooooooooooo!!!</em></p>, <p>Hundreds of skinny arms extended from the magic circle and wrapped around the stone coffin.</p>, <p><em>Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack….</em></p>, <p>Hundreds of grotesque fingers attached to the arms scraped the surface of the stone coffin.</p>, <p>Each arm harbored deep resentment.</p>, <p>No matter how strong the stone coffin was, it couldn’t easily escape.</p>, <p><em>Crackle… crunch…</em></p>, <p>Despite its battered state, the stone coffin was not at all diminished in spirit.</p>, <p>Though it lacked a face, I could tell that it was extremely angry.</p>, <p><em>Crack, crackle…</em></p>, <p>Each slight movement of the creature caused dozens of arms clinging to its body to burst.</p>, <p>However, the number of arms, each filled with the resentment of the terrible deaths that had occurred here, was overwhelming. For every ten arms destroyed, twenty more attached themselves.</p>, <p><em>The effect isn’t bad.</em></p>, <p>If I had summoned a massive force to compete in a test of strength, the outcome would have been uncertain. But by confronting it with endless numbers, I was able to prevent that stubborn monster from fully unleashing its power.</p>, <p>But these spirits were merely a temporary measure.</p>, <p>They could stop it but not defeat it.</p>, <p>I summoned my magical power and reached out to one of the tools lying in a corner of the basement.</p>, <p><em>Shrrrrriek—</em></p>, <p>The line of magical energy I sent from my fingertips entwined around a tool I had been eyeing from the start.</p>, <p>It was a hammer with a heavy metal head, likely used for crushing the bones of specimens or splitting magic stones.</p>, <p>I projected my magic and will toward the distant hammer and that force transformed into artificial telekinesis to realize my will.</p>, <p><em>Whirrrrr!</em></p>, <p>The hammer flew through the air and cut through the wind.</p>, <p>And then it landed precisely in my hand.</p>, <p>“This should do.”</p>, <p>Hand-to-hand combat isn’t my thing but…</p>, <p>Considering the stone creature’s resistance to magic, this was the most efficient method.</p>]\n",

It was tangled in the hands of the ghosts and was struck directly.</p>, <p>The impact was substantial enough that the hefty weight of the stone coffin shook and lifted into the air.</p>, <p><em>Right, with all the buffs on me, it’s only expected to have this much power.</em></p>, <p>The stone coffin, knocked away by the strike, bounced back up to attack me again, but…</p>, <p><em>Boom! Crash! Crack, boom!</em></p>, <p>From that point onward, the scene devolved into indiscriminate pounding.</p>, <p>Each time I swung the hammer, it sounded as if mountains were collapsing.</p>, <p>The stone coffin was unable to put up much resistance and rolled around the basement several times.</p>, <p>Yet despite this, the stone coffin charged at me again with stubborn ferocity.</p>, <p>“Then take some more!”</p>, <p><em>Baaaang!! Baaaang! Baaaaaaang!</em></p>, <p>“Heave… heave… Indeed, this is not a task for my body.”</p>, <p>Even with all the buffs, it was still so tiring… Though I also had the intention of testing the third-order buffs.</p>, <p>I concluded that even if I gained other buffs, I should avoid such actions as much as possible.</p>, <p>But even amidst this, the stone coffin relentlessly flew at me.</p>, <p>“It’s too hard!

Want to go again?”</p>, <p>It seemed that the stone creature was finally realizing that it could not defeat me.</p>, <p>Instead of charging again, it took a different action.</p>, <p><em>Creaaaaaaaak… Creaaaaaaaaaaaaak…</em></p>, <p>The stone coffin which had no way to make a voice made the sound of stones grinding against the lid.</p>, <p>It was similar to a beast growling.</p>, <p>“What are you going to do if you growl at me!”</p>, <p>After a few more hits, the stone coffin was thoroughly subdued.</p>, <p>It lost the will to resist and became docile, but that wasn’t enough.</p>, <p>If I just wanted to subdue it, there were many ways to do so without the trouble of beating it.</p>, <p>I extended my hand towards the stone coffin and activated a special trait.</p>, <p>[Hidden Trait ‘Heir of the Corpse Pile’ activated.]</p>, <p>This was not magic.</p>, <p>It was a hidden trait gained by absorbing the ‘Echo of Suffocation’ from the Hollow Lord.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p>[Heir of the Corpse Pile]: You can turn otherworldly beings that have submitted to you into your minions.</p>, <p>/The followers of the Leader of Suffocation will obey you.</p>, <p>****</p>, <p><em>Charrararuk—Shririririk—.</em></p>, <p>Magical reins and chains sprouted from the “Echo of Suffocation” residing in my soul and wrapped around the stone coffin.</p>, <p>[‘Magical Storage – Hungry Stone Coffin’ resists your trait with its willpower.]</p>, <p>[Subjugation check in progress…]</p>, <p>[Check successful! ‘Magical Storage – Hungry Stone Coffin’ recognizes the ‘Echo of Suffocation’ within you and submits to your power.]</p>, <p><em>Paahat—.</em></p>, <p>The magical symbols on the surface of the stone coffin writhed and began to change shape.</p>, <p>Eventually, the symbols transformed to reflect the form of my soul and magical power pattern.</p>, <p>Now, this stone coffin was also my possession.</p>, <p>[Achievement Unlocked!

Click! Squeak!</em></p>, <p>Strange noises came from all around.</p>, <p>These were the sounds of the necromancy golems tidying up the mansion.</p>, <p>Today was the day for a thorough cleaning.</p>, <p>The [Hungry Mansion] had become my new base since yesterday.</p>, <p>This living room is located on the first floor of that mansion.</p>, <p>“Right, move that over there. Hey, that won’t do. Bring a mop and start by cleaning the floor.”</p>, <p><em>Creak, creak, clack, rattle.</em></p>, <p>As soon as I somewhat gathered myself from the nightmare, I awakened all the necromancy golems in the mansion.</p>, <p>Though born as monsters to attack intruders in the mansion, they were now serving as workers to improve the living conditions of the mansion.</p>, <p>For the sake of work efficiency, I also reconfigured the bodies of some golems.</p>, <p>For example, there was one with a whip and a broom where its hands should be.</p>, <p>A necromancy golem with four arms was rearranging a cabinet that had spilled its contents, and a large-bodied necromancy golem was moving a sofa.</p>, <p>Others were cleaning windows, waxing the hallway, and mending curtains, among various tasks.</p>, <p>The cleaning had been ongoing for almost half a day yet the living room and hallway had not completely escaped their previously gloomy atmosphere.</p>, <p>“Anyway, this is a house haunted by a 150-year-old ghost… No, this isn’t an order. Continue what you were doing.”</p>, <p>This Hungry Mansion was a malevolent space filled with centuries of madness and dark energy.</p>, <p>No amount of diligent cleaning in a day or two could transform this mansion into a plausible country house.</p>, <p>Considering such aspects and lowering my expectations considerably, if I looked around the mansion again… I could now barely give it a clean bill of health.</p>, <p>Necromancy golems of various forms were busily moving throughout the interior of the mansion.</p>, <p>And as vigorously as the necromancy golems moved, the unpleasant noise they generated filled every corner of the mansion.</p>, <p><em>Screech, squeak, creak! Squeak, squeak!</em></p>, <p><em>It’s not a pleasant sound.</em></p>, <p>Since their bodies were composed of various bits and pieces, it seems unlikely that any improvement would eliminate that noise.</p>, <p>Maybe it would help to change the operational mechanism? Perhaps inserting bearings at each joint…</p>, <p>But before that, there’s still a mountain of things that need organizing.</p>, <p>For example… the second floor.</p>, <p>I climbed the stairs to the second floor.</p>, <p>There are a total of four rooms on the second floor.</p>, <p>And there is a staircase leading up from the second floor.</p>, <p>Climbing that staircase takes you to an attic that is a bit difficult to call the third floor.</p>, <p>However, the attic was of no significant importance even in the game.</p>, <p><em>Is there just an infiltration path leading to the attic?</em></p>, <p>If above the attic means the roof, there was a window leading to it.</p>, <p>This was only used once when infiltrating the mansion in the game. It was likely just an element to provide various play experiences.</p>, <p>Anyway, I don’t have the energy to fix such a meaningless attic.</p>, <p>For now, the focus was on the first and second floors and the basement. These areas alone covered almost 200 pyeong (unit).</p>, <p>Moreover, although I forcibly squeezed in a rough sleep yesterday, if I wanted to sleep comfortably tonight, I needed to quickly clean up the second floor.</p>, <p>Worms with human-face patterns on their bodies emerged, spirits that still stubbornly remained in the mansion created unpleasant noises, and fully skeletonized corpses appeared from under the beds.</p>, <p>Honestly, even without the presence of abyssal beings, it was a space where one couldn’t sleep normally.</p>, <p>“Hmm, things are going well here too.”</p>, <p>As I surveyed the second floor, a few necromancy golems were busily moving around and tidying up each room.</p>, <p>Just as I was inspecting the space I had mentally designated as my room, I briefly turned my gaze to the room next door.</p>, <p>“Hmm… but what should I do about this one…”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon was sleeping in this room.</p>, <p>While one necromancy golem was busy cleaning the room, Heo Sang-hyeon lay there without any movement.</p>, <p>To such an extent that… he seemed not even to be breathing.</p>, <p>His complexion was as pale as a corpse, dark circles were deeply etched under his eyes, and a sense of death was intuitively intense around him.</p>, <p>I briefly manipulated magical power to check on Heo Sang-hyeon’s condition.</p>, <p>[System: The effect of Heavenly Divine Qi is active.</p>, <p>// Heavenly Divine Qi: Automatically casts the ‘Healing Meditation’ spell on a chosen target and increases the effect of rest by 100%.]</p>, <p>In reality, he was dead a long time ago.</p>, <p>His soul was forcibly trapped in his body by the power of necromancy.</p>, <p>Now, the mirror hanging around his neck was forcefully preventing his soul from reaching Buddhahood.</p>, <p>He wasn’t alive, but it was also difficult to say that he was completely dead.</p>, <p>“I can’t sleep without it.”</p>, <p>The mirror was keeping Heo Sang-hyeon from dying.</p>, <p>And if I wanted to sleep comfortably, I needed that mirror. Not tidying up my room.</p>, <p>Originally, the mirror was not created to keep Heo Sang-hyeon asleep like this.</p>, <p>It was made to prevent my recurring nightmares.</p>, <p>What to do?

Here, I’ll give you this instead.”</p>, <p>I held out a teacup that was nearby.</p>, <p><em>Clank, clank… Clunk!</em></p>, <p>Doldol hesitantly opened the lid with a cautious glance.</p>, <p>Under the lid loomed a swirling and eerie darkness.</p>, <p><em>Whoosh—</em></p>, <p>I threw the teacup into that darkness and it vanished into the bottomless void.</p>, <p><em>Thud!</em></p>, <p>Having swallowed the teacup, Doldol seemed satisfied and wriggled a bit before opening the lid again.</p>, <p>This time, the same darkness was not visible.</p>, <p>Doldol had opened its true storage inside.</p>, <p>“Good job, well done.”</p>, <p>The [Hungry Stone Coffin] was a magical box.</p>, <p>This meant that it was an item that applied a similar concept to the limitless pouch that provided unlimited inventory bags, which was commonly depicted in games.</p>, <p>Inside, it was a complex and continuously overlapping multilayered space.</p>, <p>To access a specific storage within these numerous spaces, I needed permission from the stone coffin, or rather from Doldol.</p>, <p>While I couldn’t tell where that strange subspace led, if I fed random items into that darkness… Doldol liked it.</p>, <p>This tendency must also be influenced by me.</p>, <p><em>Do I now have to keep pleasing the whims of a box as I live?</em></p>, <p>The thought of where my life was headed crossed my mind, but regardless, I inspected the contents of the box.</p>, <p>The inside of Doldol was filled with items that looked like antiques at first glance.</p>, <p>Not all of them could be considered top-quality, but each was an artifact endowed with magical powers or a sinister history.</p>, <p>When the hungry stone coffin was destroyed, most of these items would disappear into some subspace.</p>, <p><em>Well, some could be recovered with some effort.</em></p>, <p>Only by subduing the hungry stone coffin Doldol could I claim ownership of all these things.</p>, <p>Moreover, some of the items held value beyond mere artifacts.</p>, <p><em>For example, something like this.</em></p>, <p>I picked up an old book from inside the stone coffin.</p>, <p>[Great Yin Water Treasure Secret Scripture</p>, <p>Category: Grimoire</p>, <p>Author: Unknown</p>, <p>Creation Year: 19th Century</p>, <p>Language: Chinese</p>, <p>It is a manual for the followers of the “leader of suffocation”.</p>, <p>The original is presumed to have been written in French; this is a translation of the original.</p>, <p>It covers the ecology and history of beings that lurk in the darkness beneath the earth, methods to imprison and control human souls, and techniques for human sacrifices.</p>, <p>Research is required to ascertain the true value of the book.]</p>, <p>The leader of suffocation was an alias for the great old being worshipped by the Hollow Lord, known as [He Who Comes from the Darkness].</p>, <p>This accursed book was the reason this mansion was built and why a monster like Hollow Lord was born.</p>, <p>And thus, the descendants born in this house were doomed to live as slaves to the Hollow Lord, generation after generation.</p>, <p>Of course, due to omissions and deteriorations during the translation process, this book wasn’t as valuable as the original, but it was still one of the finest grimoires that could be found in [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>It seemed wise to check this book first, even if it meant delaying the interpretation of the Silent Scripture of the Dreaming Path</p>, <p>“However… this isn’t what I need right now.”</p>, <p>After I set aside the Great Yin Water Treasure Secret Scripture, an item hidden beneath it revealed itself.</p>, <p>It was a silver mask with an elaborate design that gave off an unpleasant feeling.</p>, <p>It was an excessively detailed replica of a real human’s face.</p>, <p><em>All items in this mansion seem to follow this pattern, but…</em></p>, <p>This one looked particularly ominous.</p>, <p>It wasn’t just a mask with an unpleasant appearance.</p>, <p>This was a death mask cast in silver from a mold taken from a dead person’s face.</p>, <p><em>It also means there was originally a corpse that looked exactly like this mask.</em></p>, <p>He was a mad cultist who invoked the influence of [He Who Comes from the Darkness] through vile and filthy rituals… Hollow Lord’s father.</p>, <p>Having lost his humanity and become a madman, he created offspring for the abyssal beings and ultimately, his soul was trapped in this mask.</p>, <p><em>Gulp.</em></p>, <p>What was that? Did I just swallow my saliva?</p>, <p><em>It’s the influence of mask obsession…</em></p>, <p>The madness that had taken root in my mind influenced my obsession with masks.</p>, <p>It started simply as a symptom of needing to cover my face with a mask, but now, just seeing a mask-shaped object triggered excessive emotions within me.</p>, <p>Definitely.</p>, <p>I thought this mask was really cool.</p>, <p>It was a mask crafted entirely by imprisoning a human’s death.</p>, <p>Despite the eerie mask seemingly still echoing the death throes of a soul, I now wanted to wear it urgently.</p>, <p><em>Ugh… I did take it out with the intention to wear it…</em></p>, <p>Let’s not think too deeply about it now.</p>, <p>Unlike other mental illnesses, my obsession with masks had lingered in my mind for too long.</p>, <p>It seemed I needed to overcome this mask obsession before it led to more serious problems.</p>, <p>As I took out the [Dead Man’s Mask], I spoke to Doldol.</p>, <p>“It’s okay to close it now.”</p>, <p><em>Thump!</em></p>, <p>I patted the top of Doldol’s head… that is, the upper part of the stone coffin and continued.</p>, <p>“Good job. Go rest on the second floor.”</p>, <p><em>Thud, thud, thud, thud…!</em></p>, <p><em>Crash!</em></p>, <p><em>Bang, crunch!</em></p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>As Doldol rushed to the second floor, it completely shattered another necromancy golem.</p>, <p>I couldn’t help but sigh when I felt a large amount of magical power being drained away.</p>, <p>“Ah…”</p>, <p>Well, that’s fine.</p>, <p>I raised my hand and examined the mask I had retrieved from Doldol’s body.</p>, <p>[Dead Man’s Mask (A-rank Accessory): A mask made to seal the soul and magical power of a dead human.</p>, <p>The longer it is worn, the more the wearer becomes assimilated with the soul trapped within the mask.</p>, <p>Pure Silver Madness: Forces a sanity check when worn.

The result of the sanity check is changed to success.]</p>, <p>“Good job.”</p>, <p>The message window disappeared without any additional messages.</p>, <p>In an old mirror hanging in one corner of the living room, I saw myself wearing the mask.</p>, <p>I looked like a mad mage who had lost his own face and borrowed that of a dead man.</p>, <p>I activated another ability embedded in the mask.</p>, <p>[The effect of the A-rank accessory ‘Dead Man’s Mask’, ‘Gift of the Dead’ has been activated.</p>, <p>// Gift of the Dead: Allows for the storage and retrieval of magical power and knowledge within the mask.</p>, <p>Along with a dizzying tinnitus, magical power from the netherworld began to flow from the Dead Man’s Mask.</p>, <p><em>Ziiiiiiing…</em></p>, <p><em>It’s a complete hodgepodge of low purity magic power.</em></p>, <p>The mask had a lot of magical power that the previous owner, the Hollow Lord, collected from various places.</p>, <p>Although it was a lot, it was impure and low-grade magical that was poorly refined.</p>, <p>Unlike other magical powers I had absorbed before, absorbing such energy could cause internal injuries or, in martial arts terms, lead to something like “qi deviation”.</p>, <p><em>Well, it doesn’t matter since I’m not going to use it.</em></p>, <p>I pulled the lines of magical power emanating from the necromancy golems and transferred them into the mask.</p>, <p><em>Clunk.</em></p>, <p>As the path of the magic shifted, the golems simultaneously halted their movements and then reset and rebooted.</p>, <p><em>Creeeek, creak, creeeek!</em></p>, <p>Now, instead of drawing magical power directly from me, the necromancy golems were supplied with energy through the Dead Man’s Mask.</p>, <p>After floating a few magic circles in the air, I slowly removed the mask.</p>, <p>The Dead Man’s Mask ascended slowly into the air.</p>, <p>It had essentially become a kind of auxiliary battery.</p>, <p>While the magical power embedded within it was not unlimited and would eventually deplete, the soul sealed within the mask had formed a sort of mana core, which would recharge it to some extent.</p>, <p><em>If it ever gets to the point where natural recharging isn’t enough, I could always fill it up using the resonance stone.</em></p>, <p>“Phew…”</p>, <p>I paused for a moment and touched my bare face.</p>, <p>The feeling of my face being touched by my fingertips was indescribably eerie and unsettling.</p>, <p>An unpleasant feeling of touching my human flesh.</p>, <p>The very fact of exposing my bare face felt utterly horrific.</p>, <p>Would I eventually go mad from this?</p>, <p>Gradually, I was also beginning to forget what my own face looked like.</p>, <p>I sighed again and put on [Carcosa’s Mask] that I had been wearing before.</p>, <p>It was an indescribably comfortable feeling.</p>, <p>Now, the face of a monster with four eyes was reflected in the mirror.</p>, <p><em>Alright, shall I head out now?</em></p>, <p>The only thing left was to move my important belongings from the studio apartment where I had been living on rent. After some thought, I decided to ask for the help of Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>He was one of just two NPCs in Paju with whom I had formed a firm alliance.</p>, <p>For reference, Tudor was a reliable broker, but she wasn’t a firm ally of mine.</p>, <p>And if I asked Cheong-ho who had become a firm ally recently, too many people might end up knowing my information.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok grumbled for a moment but drove to the mansion without further complaint.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim, you know how much my fare is, right?”</p>, <p>“About 500,000?”</p>, <p>“No, I don’t usually charge that much just for transport…”</p>, <p>The last time he took me to Tanhyeon, Jang Hyeon-deok had boldly extorted 500,000 won from me, but now he hesitated and his words trailed off.</p>, <p>Of course, Tanhyeon is one of the most dangerous areas in Paju, so naturally, the fares then and now cannot be simply compared.</p>, <p>“And by the way, that needs to be loaded too, is that alright?”</p>, <p>“That…? What is that… Aaaaaahhhhh!!”</p>, <p><em>Thud, thud, clatter, crash!</em></p>, <p>Doldol rushed towards Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>It was a stone coffin that was indistinguishable from a huge boulder.</p>, <p>Doldol’s appearance was no big deal to me, but for Jang Hyeon-deok who was seeing Doldol for the first time it was as if a mountain was charging at him.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok was so startled that he almost fell over. Had the call van not been parked behind him, he truly would have tumbled to the ground.</p>, <p>If that had happened, I might have lost one of my only two firm allies today. Amitabha.</p>, <p>“What is this! What is this?!”</p>, <p>“It’s Doldol.”</p>, <p>“Doldol!?! Aaaah! Stop, don’t come any closer!”</p>, <p><em>Thud, clatter, bang!</em></p>, <p>What a mess.</p>, <p>“It’s definitely a bit too big to fit in the car.”</p>, <p>I momentarily summoned my magical power and stretched out my hand towards Doldol. A brilliant magic circle formed around the bulky body of Doldol.</p>, <p>If I adjust this, and reposition that…</p>, <p>[Shrink]</p>, <p><em>Whirrrr!!!</em></p>, <p>It was a spell that became available after unlocking third-order magic.</p>, <p>As the magic activated, Doldol’s size reduced. Now, Doldol was about a small stone box, roughly 50cm in size.</p>, <p>As straightforward as the name of the spell was its effect.</p>, <p>However, calculating the area of effect and pressure was a bit complex. After all, it was magic that disregarded the law of conservation of mass.</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok wore a look of surprise at the effect of the magic that had been activated right before his eyes.</p>, <p>It seemed to be mixed with a bit of admiration and awe.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim, can I learn magic too?”</p>, <p>“Um… you probably can’t.”</p>, <p>“Why not?”</p>, <p>“Because you’re slow.”</p>, <p>“I’m not slow! I’m very sharp and…”</p>, <p>“No, I mean your mind is slow.”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok continued to whine without stopping.</p>, <p>Regardless, I loaded Doldol into the back of the car and sat in the passenger seat of Jang Hyeon-deok’s call van.</p>, <p>“Hasn’t the car been fixed yet?”</p>, <p>“Ah, I haven’t had the time.”</p>, <p>The last time Jang Hyeon-deok helped me, the car was damaged quite a bit. There were still dents, scratches, and torn marks everywhere even now.</p>, <p>“Get it fixed quickly and send me the bill for the repairs.”</p>, <p>“Ah, I will fix it. But I was a big help, wasn’t I?”</p>, <p>I looked at Jang Hyeon-deok, who was momentarily puffing up his chest with pride. There he was, facing me with that expression. Why aren’t we starting yet? Oh…</p>, <p>“…Right. You were a big help. Thanks.”</p>, <p>“Oh, you don’t need to say that… Hahaha!”</p>, <p>Oh …</p>, <p>“Alright, we’re setting off now!”</p>, <p><em>**</em>*</p>, <p>Cleaning the studio apartment in Geumchon was not a difficult task.</p>, <p>All I had to do was tell Doldol to swallow everything in the room and it was done.</p>, <p>However, there was an issue when Doldol accidentally swallowed the refrigerator, which was included as part of the apartment’s amenities.</p>, <p>“Hey! Spit it out, you! Why would you swallow that?”</p>, <p><em>Grrrrrr, crackle.</em></p>, <p>That noise was Doldol being stubborn after I forcibly removed the refrigerator.</p>, <p>Should I call it gluttony?</p>, <p>Or maybe a hoarding instinct?</p>, <p>Fortunately, even without coveting the refrigerator, there were plenty of items in the studio apartment that caught Doldol’s interest.</p>, <p>Doldol particularly enjoyed swallowing the cursed gold ornaments that came from the bodies of the golden dancers. It was even shivering with delight.</p>, <p>I’m not sure what the difference is, but it seems it has its own tastes.</p>, <p>“Alright, step back for a moment, Doldol.”</p>, <p>When Doldol stepped back, I summoned my magical power.</p>, <p>[Memory Erase]</p>, <p><em>Fwoooosh!!</em></p>, <p>It was a spell that removed magical fingerprints and traces left in space, as well as the memories of objects.</p>, <p>I had never done anything to warrant that level of tracking, but now, not even a psychic with psychometry abilities or a druid who could read the Earth’s memory would be able to find any trace of me.</p>, <p>Additionally, I had sprayed a magical smokescreen as a precaution against any unforeseen situations before I could finally leave this studio apartment.</p>, <p>“Are we really leaving empty-handed?”</p>, <p>“As I said earlier, everything is packed inside Doldol.”</p>, <p>“Wow…”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok wore a look of amazement.</p>, <p>“Where can I find something like this?”</p>, <p>“You should try hard and rob a haunted house somewhere too.”</p>, <p>“Ugh, I can’t do that alone.”</p>, <p>“If you take the lead, I’ll help.”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok responded with a grimace.</p>, <p>“No, I’d rather give up.”</p>, <p>The cramped studio apartment I had lived in for a few months was now behind me.</p>, <p>There were still some paperwork formalities left, but vacating was something I could manage over a phone call on my way out.</p>, <p>“So, should we head back to that theme park right away?”</p>, <p>“No, sorry, but let’s stop by the market first.”</p>, <p>“The market? Are you going to see the old man?”</p>, <p>“Wasn’t that supposed to be a secret place?”</p>, <p>“Ah, you underestimate me, Mage-nim. I’ve been in this business for six years; how could I not know why fixers frequent Geumchon Market?”</p>, <p>Indeed, that was the case.</p>, <p>The Geumchon neighborhood was the only place where you could pick up useful artifacts. It must be information picked up from other fixers.</p>, <p>The market was not far away, so we arrived near the pawnshop quickly.</p>, <p>It was getting dark.</p>, <p>It was a quiet time when vendors were preparing to pack up their stalls, but today, there was an unusually large crowd and the atmosphere was bustling.</p>, <p>“What’s going on? There are a lot of people.”</p>, <p>“Ah, the night market started yesterday. Everyone’s going to stay open until 10 p.m.”</p>, <p>“A night market?”</p>, <p>“Yes. Oh, you might not know? They do it every year around this time.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… I see. But with so many people, there’s nowhere to park the car?”</p>, <p>“I’ll be in that alley over there, so call me when you’re done.”</p>, <p>Certainly, Geumchon Market had a more vibrant atmosphere than usual.</p>, <p>The market boasted temporary stalls selling unusual foods that were not typically seen, and there were various bright lights and impressive banners everywhere.</p>, <p><em>The problem is…</em></p>, <p>Why does the night market exist?</p>, <p>I know that around this time, there is a night market in Paju, or specifically, in Geumchon Market.</p>, <p>But that schedule belongs to the reality I originally lived in.</p>, <p>In [Cthulhu World], such trivial events do not exist.</p>, <p>Of course, not everything here was exactly like the game, but still, I felt oddly out of place.</p>, <p>The fact that just last night I fought against a 150-year-old skeleton seemed unbelievable given the mundane scene around me.</p>, <p>It felt as though I was not in some bizarre otherworld with fixers and monsters, but had actually returned to my original world.</p>, <p>Of course, I couldn’t just blend in immediately.</p>, <p>I layered several spells to minimize my presence then walked through the peaceful Geumchon Market.</p>, <p>*******</p>, <p>TN: Doldol is cute!</p>]\n",

            "[<p>“Hey, what’s this? You’re back again, masked person?”</p>, <p>… To be honest, I was a little sentimental.</p>, <p>But that emotion shattered instantly upon seeing the chaotic scene at Geumchon Pawnshop and Jeong Eun-taek.</p>, <p>“Yes, old man. I’m here. That part-timer isn’t here today?”</p>, <p>Today, Jeong Ye-eun who usually helps at the pawnshop was nowhere to be seen.</p>, <p>“That kid ran off to the night market.”</p>, <p>“Ah, I see. Could I ask for some items?”</p>, <p>“So, what do you need today?”</p>, <p>“Um… I’d like to buy about 10 meters of silver thread, if you have any? And some branches for materials. Any type of wood will do, as long as they’re blessed or consecrated.”</p>, <p>“I don’t know what you’re planning to do with all this stuff.”</p>, <p>My requests continued at length.</p>, <p>Each time, Jeong Eun-taek grumbled with a look of disgust on his face, but strangely enough, I managed to gather everything I needed.</p>, <p><em>This place is truly out of the ordinary.</em></p>, <p>Just a short walk beyond the door, the citizens of Paju were happily munching on street food and taking selfies at the night market, yet here I was, buying ghoul finger bones and dried hydra skins.</p>, <p>As I was finishing up the payment, Jung Eun-taek hesitated for a moment before speaking.</p>, <p>“Hey, you mentioned wanting to go to the Thousand Gold Temple before, right?”</p>, <p>I had been meaning to ask about it myself, but he brought it up first.</p>, <p>Yes, I had now surpassed level 30, which meant I was eligible to enter the Thousand Gold Temple.</p>, <p>“Can I get an entry ticket?”</p>, <p>“Hmph, it’s not that easy to get one.”</p>, <p>“But you must have brought it up for a reason?”</p>, <p>At my comment, Jung Eun-taek frowned again.</p>, <p>“A contact of mine asked for a fixer. Turns out, there’s no one quite like you around?”</p>, <p>“Um… that must be an exaggeration.”</p>, <p>“Exaggeration, my foot. I may have washed my hands of that business a long time ago, but I’m not deaf yet.”</p>, <p>Jung Eun-taek paused before continuing.</p>, <p>“Tch, anyway, I’ll send a message through the alley witch in about a fortnight, so take the job.”</p>, <p>“Looks like someone is planning to visit the Thousand Gold Temple, huh?”</p>, <p>“Yes, a teacher who I owe a great deal to from about 20 years ago… wants to visit the Thousand Gold Temple. Can I ask for your help?”</p>, <p>It was a bit roundabout, but this was essentially a prerequisite quest to enter the Thousand Gold Temple.</p>, <p>I would be visiting the Thousand Gold Temple with someone who possessed an entry ticket.</p>, <p>I answered with a smile.</p>, <p>“Of course.”</p>, <p>Since my face was always hidden by a mask, there was no need to manage my expression.</p>, <p><em>**</em>*</p>, <p>After a short journey, we were in front of the hungry mansion again.</p>, <p>“Do you want to come in and rest for a bit?”</p>, <p>“No, no, no, no! I have a schedule lined up after this, so I need to get going to work!”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok seemed to still have some trauma related to ghosts as he fumbled around.</p>, <p><em>That kind of issue isn’t easily fixed.</em></p>, <p>“Please call me again next time. If it’s Mage-nim asking, I can go anywhere!”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok left with those shameless words.</p>, <p>His tone was such that it seemed unlikely that I would need to call him anytime soon, but we would meet again sooner than he expected.</p>, <p>After all, the mansion was deep in the mountains, far from the city, and there were no buses that came this way.</p>, <p>Even for something as simple as buying food and drink, I would likely need to call Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>After watching Jang Hyeon-deok leave, I went back into the house with Doldol.</p>, <p>The cleaning was almost finished by now.</p>, <p>The dust that gathered along with the heavy presence of negative energy was now largely cleared away, along with the old air and the ghosts that had clung to the mansion.</p>, <p>Of course, this didn’t mean that the mansion had lost its identity as a haunted house.</p>, <p>Even after all the fuss that had been going on all day, the mansion was still dark and gloomy. Evil ghosts not yet completely expelled still lingered in every corner.</p>, <p>“Those malicious bastards …”</p>, <p>It was awkward to say they were merely tenants inconvenienced by the change in homeownership, but it seemed they too were taken aback by their suddenly overturned nest.</p>, <p>As my gaze reached them, they slipped into the cracks in the walls and disappeared somewhere.</p>, <p>Hunting them down to drive them out would prove to be an exhausting task.</p>, <p>“I can’t really blame Jang Hyeon-deok for running away…”</p>, <p>No matter what, this mansion was still a haunted house. And its identity would continue to be the same in the future.</p>, <p>I don’t have all the time in the world, so let’s resolve other matters first.</p>, <p>“Doldol! Follow me to the basement!”</p>, <p>I called Doldol and headed down to the basement.</p>, <p><em>Clank, clank, rumble, rumble!</em></p>, <p>It moved more noisily than before now that it shrunk in size.</p>, <p>“Let’s take out what we put in earlier.”</p>, <p><em>Creaaak!</em></p>, <p>One of the spaces inside Doldol opened.</p>, <p>Now that it was reduced in size, Doldol’s interior was just large enough for a human head to barely pass through, yet from within it spilled the contents of an entire studio apartment.</p>, <p>Cursed jewels, golden dancers’ body fragments, a golden skull still alive and in hibernation, an egg created from the fusion of the lump of flesh and the parasite, several grimoires and magic stones, assorted junk collected from various places, magical catalysts, materials, and neglected artifacts due to their low utility poured out.</p>, <p>The basement had been used by the previous owner, Hollow Lord, as his magic laboratory and a place to disassemble the victims of his necromancy.</p>, <p>It was also a space where many creatures had lost their lives.</p>, <p>Although necromancy golems had been employed to clean it, traces of its past could not be completely erased.</p>, <p>A subtle stench of blood and decay lingered around.</p>, <p>“Well, this will get better as we keep using it.”</p>, <p>After all, this space was the mage’s workshop I had long desired.</p>, <p>As the necromancy golems busily tidied up, I examined Hollow Lord’s research journal and grimoires scattered around the basement.</p>, <p>Although my presence seemed to hinder the cleanup, no one complained; none of the golems possessed the self-awareness to do so.</p>, <p>This was a research lab that had been used for 150 years by someone directly sponsored by a being of the abyss.</p>, <p>Although I had pilfered from this mansion a few times before, this was the first time I had taken possession of it in such a complete state.</p>, <p>The magical systems were different from my own so some adjustments were needed, but I could use most of the existing furnishings as they were.</p>, <p>The materials that remained here were somewhat biased towards a particular field, but they would ultimately become my magic and knowledge.</p>, <p>“Thanks to this, I can start immediately without much preparation.”</p>, <p>I also resolved to tackle the tasks I had postponed under the excuse of not having a workshop.</p>, <p>The golden dancer’s head, which I had brought from Tanhyeon, caught my eye.</p>, <p>“I’ve been wondering where to use this. Once everything is ready, I’ll start with that.”</p>, <p>It was a powerful magical creature that even I had struggled to handle.</p>, <p>Combining it with the necromancy golems’ technology could create something incredibly useful.</p>, <p>If I prepare adequately, I expect to receive a request through Tudor to visit the Thousand Gold Temple.</p>, <p>I still hold expectations for the black market that Cheongèho mentioned.</p>, <p>Perhaps because now I had a house, a lot of future-oriented thoughts came to mind.</p>, <p>Once I complete the necessary preparations at this mansion, I can begin the mid-game play of this [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>I will not just stay in Paju but travel to other areas to advance the main story.</p>, <p>Having finished my thoughts, I summoned several necromancy golems to tidy up the workshop.</p>, <p>Now, I could afford to rest. Stretching my still sore body, I slowly emerged from the basement when an unexpected problem arose.</p>, <p>[……]</p>, <p>It was a signal from a necromancy golem I had tasked with monitoring Heo Sang-hyeon.</p>, <p>“What inconvenient timing.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon woke up.</p>, <p>I sighed briefly and looked out the window along the corridor.</p>, <p>Outside, it was dark with stars scattered across the sky.</p>, <p>My sleep pattern was already irregular but it seemed I would sleep only after the sunrise today.</p>, <p>When I arrived at Heo Sang-hyeon’s room on the second floor, I knocked on the door slowly before opening it.</p>, <p>And when I entered the room, Heo Sang-hyeon was startled and struggled to sit up.</p>, <p>If I were to count the time he was asleep, it was roughly over 24 hours.</p>, <p>I silently watched him to gauge his condition.</p>, <p>However, his appearance did not reveal his health status.</p>, <p>His face remained pale and skinny like a corpse, with that distinctive aura of the undead.</p>, <p>To truly assess his condition, I needed to look beyond his outward appearance and into his inner state.</p>, <p>The negative magical power flowing within Heo Sang-hyeon was more active than before.</p>, <p>Surprisingly, the power of the Ancient God’s Mirror had enhanced his inherent magic and filled him with a different kind of energy.</p>, <p>It was magic that responded instantly to my will… Since it originated from me.</p>, <p>“Well, you seem to be in better condition than I expected.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon, whose gaunt face made his large eyes stand out, blinked excessively and rolled his eyes before hesitating slightly and then speaking.</p>, <p>“Ma-Master…?”</p>, <p>Ugh, I guessed it would turn out like this, but it’s still troublesome.</p>, <p>Only recently had I become a mage solving various incidents in the supernatural Paju, but before that, I, Kim Shin-hwa, was just an ordinary office worker in South Korea for decades.</p>, <p>It was unnatural for me to hear someone eight years older calling me ‘Master.’</p>, <p>“Drop the ‘Master’ talk. How are you feeling?”</p>, <p>“I am… alright. Much better than before… I am.”</p>, <p>“That’s good to hear.”</p>, <p>“But…”</p>, <p>He unconsciously fumbled with the mirror around his neck. It was a different technique from the necromancy magic that had previously bound him to this world.</p>, <p>It was much kinder than necromancy. However, Heo Sang-hyeon seemed awkward with the sensation.</p>, <p>“How did you do it…? How did you handle the ‘Master’? And what exactly happened to me?”</p>, <p>“Um…”</p>, <p>I had left him alone for this conversation, but what should I talk about next?</p>, <p>It seemed that Heo Sang-hyeon was referring to someone else as his “Master”, not me.</p>, <p>“Firstly, your former master, Hollow Lord, is dead.”</p>, <p>“Dead? That can’t be…!”</p>, <p>“Why can’t it be? You can sense it yourself, right?”</p>, <p>“……”</p>, <p>“And just as you’ve sensed, I have come to own everything in this mansion.”</p>, <p>“Yes… I am aware.”</p>, <p>Everything mentioned here included even Heo Sang-hyeon, who was a slave to the Hollow Lord.</p>, <p>Most of his past actions—talking with me, mocking me, attacking me—had nothing to do with his will.</p>, <p>Perhaps the only true expression of his will was his attempt to drive me away immediately when we just met.</p>, <p>“Now, despite that, I have no intention of forcibly keeping you as a slave. Nor do I wish to waste magical power and a precious artifact without purpose.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon briefly flashed a vague smile.</p>, <p>It was the kind of smile that could be worn by a fanatic devoid of self.</p>, <p>What Heo Sang-hyeon thought before doesn’t matter.</p>, <p>Loyalty to me is already being instilled in his mind.</p>, <p>His loyalty to me takes precedence over any personal needs for protection or desires for hope and dreams.</p>, <p>If I were to command him to die, he would embrace death with joy and ecstasy.</p>, <p>“I probably won’t understand your desires or your psychology. I’ve never died and come back to life. Of course, the concept of personal desire may be weak for you given the artificially induced loyalty …”</p>, <p>I reached out my hand towards him.</p>, <p>A few magic circles blossomed around my extended hand in the middle of the air between Heo Sang-hyeon and me.</p>, <p>Some of the magic circles were connected to the mirror hanging around Heo Sang-hyeon’s neck, and others were linked to his head and heart.</p>, <p>I moved the circle connected to his head.</p>, <p><em>Buzzzzzz….</em></p>, <p>The magic circles shifted according to my will, and soon a part of the shackles entwined with Heo Sang-hyeon’s mind transformed.</p>, <p>Specifically, I had removed the coercive loyalty that constrained his thoughts and actions.</p>, <p>At the same time, an immediate response occurred in his body.</p>, <p>His lifeless lips twisted and his bony hands trembled violently.</p>, <p>This was the original emotion that Heo Sang-hyeon should feel—fear.</p>, <p>“Now, can you think a bit more for yourself?”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon seemed unable to open his mouth.</p>, <p>With a troubled expression, he just rolled his large eyes and hunched his body.</p>, <p>“If you wish for salvation, I will liberate you now. There will be no pain or discomfort.”</p>, <p>“I, I, I… I…”</p>, <p>But I raised my hand to stop his words.</p>, <p>“Listen until the end.”</p>, <p>“…Yes.”</p>, <p>“If you wish to live longer in this state, I can help you with that.”</p>, <p>His eyes widened again.</p>, <p>They were so large that even I could feel the anxiety.</p>, <p>“Of course, it won’t be for free. I need a butler to manage the mansion.”</p>, <p>Although he couldn’t see it behind the mask, I was smiling.</p>]\n",

The effect of the nightmare has been nullified.]</p>, <p>“It seems this won’t do after all.”</p>, <p>I looked at the dreamcatcher hanging by my bedside.</p>, <p>As expected, the silver core was completely stained black.</p>, <p>[Silver Dreamcatcher (B-rank Magical Tool): A handmade dreamcatcher woven from birch imbued with magical power and silver thread. It possesses the power to ward off evil and block the intrusion of dream demons.</p>, <p>Dream Veil: Blocks magical and cursed influences that approach through dreams.</p>, <p>Creator: Kim Shin-hwa</p>, <p>Current Status: Ruptured due to overload]</p>, <p>It held up well. It blocked nightmares for about two weeks, but eventually, it broke.</p>, <p>“Ah… To make something as good as the ‘Ancient God’s Mirror’, should I use more expensive materials?”</p>, <p>In any case, the “Ancient God’s Mirror” contained the influence of ancient gods.</p>, <p>Ancient gods.</p>, <p>Or the Old Gods, Great Spirits, Pure Souls, the Great Ones, beings existing since before the dawn of time, and so on.</p>, <p>People call them what they will, but the most commonly accepted name was ancient gods.</p>, <p>These were surreal beings who existed at the opposite pole of the existence of the abyss and opposed its existence.</p>, <p>As a result, there were those who thought of them as good gods opposing the evil ones, but that wasn’t exactly the case.</p>, <p>Depending on the circumstances, even the ancient gods could turn into demons or disasters at any moment.</p>, <p>From the human perspective, they were entities far too powerful and merciless. Should I say that they were akin to storms or tsunamis?</p>, <p>Just as there can be no benevolent tsunamis or kind-hearted storms, the very existence of the ancient gods was nothing short of a massive disaster.</p>, <p>“Still, from a player’s perspective, dealing with ancient gods is somewhat easier.”</p>, <p>Among them, there were some who had appeared in human history in a positive light a few times, and if one traced the origins of ancient religions or native beliefs, they would find these entities.</p>, <p>Thanks to that, many of them were relatively easier to communicate with.</p>, <p><em>Besides, the enemy of my enemy is my ally.</em></p>, <p>The ancient gods generally despised the beings of the abyss.</p>, <p>Thanks to this, there were times when they would lend their power or wisdom if one decided to fight against the abyssal beings.</p>, <p>If one were to put it bluntly, both sides were like gangsters.</p>, <p>The difference was that whoever had the first claim to the territory had been there longer and could communicate better.</p>, <p>It was an artifact with such origins, and although the “Ancient God’s Mirror” was of low rank, it had the power to block the influence emanating from the beings of the abyss.</p>, <p>I removed the dreamcatcher that had been hanging by my bedside and examined the deteriorated parts.</p>, <p>A simple item crafted by gathering magical or natural energies had its limitations.</p>, <p>“Tsk, next time I need to make something better.”</p>, <p>I tossed the dreamcatcher toward the trash can in the corner of the room.</p>, <p><em>Thud, thunk.</em></p>, <p>The dreamcatcher hit the rim of the trash can and fell to the floor.</p>, <p>However, there was no need for me to go over and pick it up again.</p>, <p><em>Creak, screech…</em></p>, <p>The trash can moved on its own and swallowed the dreamcatcher.</p>, <p>It had been two weeks since I acquired the Hungry Mansion.</p>, <p>Although I kept in touch with Tudor and Jang Hyeon-deok from time to time, I hardly went out.</p>, <p>I had paused my work as a fixer to focus on translating grimoires and crafting artifacts.</p>, <p>“There were some minor successes, though…”</p>, <p>But I wasn’t completely satisfied.</p>, <p>Most of what I achieved was merely stabilizing the current situation or temporarily postponing problems.</p>, <p>Of course, it wasn’t that nothing had changed.</p>, <p>After briefly washing my face, I picked up my clothes, put them on, and went down to the first floor.</p>, <p>“Ah, you’re awake?”</p>, <p>This was Heo Sang-hyeon who ended up sharing a room with me.</p>, <p>“You woke up early again today?”</p>, <p>“Well, I woke up in the morning.”</p>, <p>“Hmm. What time is it now? It feels like daytime.”</p>, <p>“It’s 2 PM.”</p>, <p>“I’ve finally managed to wake up at a decent hour.”</p>, <p>“…I’ll prepare the meal now, so please wait a moment.”</p>, <p>“Understood.”</p>, <p>An undead that I unintentionally too over from the Hollow Lord.</p>, <p>In the end, Heo Sang-hyeon decided to live a little longer.</p>, <p>Now, my relationship with Heo Sang-hyeon was a firm alliance just like my relationship with Cheong-ho or Jang Hyeon-deok.</p>, <p>Of course, the situation with Jang Hyeon-deok was a bit different.</p>, <p>According to the system of [Cthulhu World], he was my summon… essentially a magical slave.</p>, <p><em>And at the same time, he is also a butler NPC that comes with the housing system.</em></p>, <p>Although I’ve removed his excessive level of loyalty, it’s ambiguous to say he’s entirely free.</p>, <p>After all, he was both a summon and a butler. In the game’s system, the titles a player can be called by such beings are limited.</p>, <p>At first, Heo Sang-hyeon tried to address me with that title. But now…</p>, <p>“Shin-hwa-nim, it’s ready.”</p>, <p>“Yes.”</p>, <p>It was a bit strange to think this way, but once I started, there seemed to be no end. “Shin-hwa ya, since I’m your hyung, I’ll call you informally”. Would our relationship go as far as that kind of development? Anyway, I decided to keep my title like this for the time being.</p>, <p>Beside the living room on the first floor was a dining area.</p>, <p>In the center of the dining area, there was a large table covered with a pristine white tablecloth.</p>, <p>The table was large enough to host a banquet for more than ten people, yet today, I was the only one eating on it.</p>, <p>On one side of the table, there was a cup of milk, pancakes, jam, fried eggs, salad, grilled sausages, grilled tomatoes, grilled pineapple, and bite-sized pieces of cheese…</p>, <p>Listing them one by one, it sounded like a lot but they were mostly one or two pieces each, so the quantity was moderate.</p>, <p>The problem was more about the vast table.</p>, <p>The sight of a meal for one neatly set on such a wide space seemed incredibly ridiculous.</p>, <p>“I’ve always thought about this, but isn’t this dining room excessively large?”</p>, <p>“The previous owner often held banquets…”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon infused a strange nuance into the word “banquet”.</p>, <p>Hollow Lord, Heo Sang-hyeon’s former master and the owner of this mansion, did not like to waste corpses.</p>, <p>Human corpses were highly useful as magical materials, ingredients for golems, and catalysts for spells.</p>, <p>And the leftovers could still be used as ornaments or even food ingredients.</p>, <p>Perhaps those banquets were some sort of inhumane and repulsive ritual.</p>, <p>Or maybe they were just frivolous acts to satisfy the Hollow Lord’s sadistic desires.</p>, <p>“That makes sense.”</p>, <p>“Yes, I’ll be in the living room for a while.”</p>, <p>“Okay.”</p>, <p>It seems Hollow Lord liked to invite others who shared his peculiar tastes for meals, but I never enjoyed eating with others.</p>, <p>After all, one cannot eat while wearing this mask.</p>, <p>I took out the dining mask I had left in the dining room and switched it.</p>, <p>It’s a mask with openings for the jaw and mouth.</p>, <p>The eyes, forehead, nose, and cheeks are still covered, but having even a part of my face exposed makes me uncomfortable.</p>, <p>To avoid accidentally catching sight of any part of my face, I had all the mirrors in the dining room removed.</p>, <p>I even got rid of the metal utensils.</p>, <p>It might be called the obsession of a lunatic but…</p>, <p>“Well, I am a lunatic after all.”</p>, <p>…</p>, <p>Ah, this is fu*king ridiculous. I tried to think positively, but it’s not easy.</p>, <p>What is this mess, really? I wish I could get over this obsession with masks quickly.</p>, <p>I spread jam on pancakes with a wooden spoon and ate slowly.</p>, <p>“Ah, this meal is really…”</p>, <p>Excessively delicious.</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon said it was nothing special, but it tasted fantastic.</p>, <p>At first, I wondered why anyone would cook fruit, but I learned that some fruits taste better cooked than raw.</p>, <p>The combination of juicy sausages that burst with flavor and pineapples grilled with sugar created a delightful sweet and salty harmony. Fluffy pancakes and the fine-quality grape jam that Heo Sang-hyeon claimed to have made himself followed suit.</p>, <p>He said he had continued to make this jam even while he was enslaved by the Hollow Lord.</p>, <p>To put it in a twisted way, you could say it was a jam created by an undead who could neither die nor live while the horrific slaughter and blasphemous rituals were taking place in this mansion.</p>, <p>However, it was the only food Heo Sang-hyeon made by his own will, amidst a life devoid of freedom.</p>, <p>It’s hard to dwell on negative thoughts with jam this delicious.</p>, <p>“Though he took the Ancient God’s Mirror from me, I gained a meal like this so it’s not a loss.”</p>, <p>Life in the harsh conditions of the Cthulhu world after falling from my usual self-sufficient life had been too long.</p>, <p>What will they prepare for dinner tonight?</p>, <p>Just as I was nearly finished eating,</p>, <p>My smartphone began to vibrate.</p>, <p><em>Before coming to this world, I really lived glued to my phone and computer…</em></p>, <p>Games and web novels. Those were my only hobbies, the joys that filled most of my life. But now that I was trapped in this bizarre world and living as if being chased every day, ironically …</p>, <p>“Ah, right, a phone call.”</p>, <p>I hardly ever use my phone, so I forgot that I needed to answer it when it vibrated.</p>, <p><em>– Dear! Why didn’t you come to see me when you were at the market last time?</em></p>, <p>It was Tudor. How did she know I had been to Paju fifteen days ago?</p>, <p>“Well, it wasn’t really a situation where I could stop by.”</p>, <p><em>– What? Do you know how busy it’s been here lately? Are you going to keep lazing around like this?</em></p>, <p>“Busy? What’s going on?”</p>, <p><em>– Hmph, never mind. You should come and see what it’s like here these days, but right now, listen to what I have to say about work.</em></p>, <p>“Calling this early, must be a request for a job, right?”</p>, <p><em>– Early? </em></p>, <p>It’s the crack of dawn right now. It was 2 PM.</p>, <p><em>– Dear… I know fixers tend to be like this, but how about living like a normal person for a change?</em></p>, <p>To be scolded like this by a witch who could go without sleep and work 24 hours was indeed something else ….</p>, <p>“Let’s talk about work instead of my lifestyle habits, shall we?”</p>, <p><em>– Ah, right. So, I see you’ve been making friends and networking in places I don’t know about? Making me jealous, huh?</em></p>, <p>Networks and the current timing. I roughly understood why she had called.</p>, <p>“I see why you called. Is it a bodyguard job?”</p>, <p><em>– Hehe… your quick thinking really makes things easier. Yes, it’s a request that came through the old man from Geumchon Pawnshop. It’s to guard a gentleman, and the location is none other than…</em></p>, <p>“The Thousand Gold Temple.”</p>, <p><em>– That’s right. You! My pretty thing! How did you manage to snag a job at the Thousand Gold Temple? They say a diligent broker finds good fortune even in her sleep. Must be Buddha’s grace for all my church-going.</em></p>, <p>Though it was clearly a joke, when it came from a witch who had crossed over from Europe, it sounded serious enough to be a bit scary.</p>, <p>Tudor explained the rough details of the request, and I agreed to move out tomorrow. We ended the call with that plan in place.</p>, <p>Tomorrow, it seems, I will finally have a chance to go out.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>I just finished breakfast and stepped into the living room to speak with Heo Sang-hyeon.</p>, <p>“I will be away for a while starting tomorrow.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon’s already dark complexion seemed to darken even more at the news.</p>, <p>“For a while? Then…. when might you return?”</p>, <p>“If early, perhaps by dawn the same day. If late, it could take a day or two. Depending on the situation, it might even be a few weeks.”</p>, <p>While situations that took weeks to resolve were rare, they were not entirely out of the realm of possibility.</p>, <p>“I’m not sure how this will sound to you, Shin-hwa-nim.”</p>, <p>Heo Sang-hyeon widened his eyes as he emphasized his next words.</p>, <p>“This is a hungry mansion.”</p>, <p>“I know. Visitors come here occasionally?”</p>, <p>But the visitors weren’t Hollow Lord’s old friends or acquaintances who shared mutual favors with him. It wasn’t as if such bizarre people existed.</p>, <p><em>It’s all because of the Home Usurpation system.</em></p>, <p>It’s an annoying system that you don’t have to worry about in an ordinary house where you pay monthly rent.</p>, <p>Securing a residence with special options and good features is not only difficult to acquire but also challenging to maintain.</p>, <p>Periodically, NPCs in situations like mine or random bands of thieves would invade and try to seize my residence.</p>, <p>Especially notorious mansions like the Hungry Mansion often attracted righteous fixers hoping to collect bounties.</p>, <p>“There is someone to guard it, so there shouldn’t be any major problems.”</p>, <p>I assured him comfortably but on the contrary, Heo Sang-hyun widened his already large eyes and became nervous.</p>, <p>“I understand. I will do my best…”</p>, <p>“What? No, I know you are capable, but there shouldn’t be a need for you to take direct action.”</p>, <p>“But…”</p>, <p>“The guardians are the necromancy golems in the mansion.”</p>, <p>Additionally, I had painstakingly placed security magic both inside and outside the mansion. It would be difficult for the clumsy ones to even step into the courtyard of the mansion.</p>, <p>“And if the worst comes to pass and all that is breached… use this.”</p>, <p>With that, I pointed to an object floating in the air in the living room.</p>, <p>“That mask…?”</p>, <p>It was the Dead Man’s Mask.</p>, <p>“It might look a bit off, but it should resolve most issues anyway.”</p>, <p>“…Understood.”</p>, <p>Though it was easy to say, my conscience was prickling a bit.</p>, <p>The mask which was modeled after the face of a dead person, contained the soul of one of Heo Sang-hyeon’s ancestors from several generations ago.</p>, <p>In seeking the cause of Heo Sang-hyeon’s state of being neither alive nor dead, one would eventually come upon this elder’s spirit.</p>, <p>Knowing this full well, I still recommended that he use his ancestor’s power and magic to resolve the issues.</p>, <p>“Again, I must remind you that the situation requiring you to use this should not arise.”</p>, <p>The complexity of the situation made me overly talkative.</p>, <p>“Well, anyway, I must now pack my things. Please take care of cleaning up the dining area.”</p>, <p>“…Yes, I understand.”</p>, <p>Leaving Heo Sang-hyeon behind, I descended into the basement.</p>, <p>Though I had confidently reassured Heo Sang-hyeon, I was also a little uneasy about suddenly vacating the mansion I had just secured.</p>, <p>But what unnerved me more was the future that loomed before me.</p>, <p>I recalled what the last message window said.</p>, <p>[Soon, the judges who represent the will of the Abyss will…]</p>, <p>It hinted that the main scenario was about to begin.</p>, <p>At this point, the fastest way to strengthen my power was through the Thousand Gold Temple.</p>, <p>Only there could certain artifacts be found, and only there could certain items be disposed of.</p>, <p>I said while looking around at the magic materials piled up in the basement.</p>, <p>“Well… I must finish organizing this by tomorrow so I can go out with peace of mind.”</p>, <p>What was placed on the workbench was the head of a beautiful monster shining in golden light.</p>, <p>The head of a golden dancer with its eyes quietly closed.</p>, <p>I extended my magical power towards it and activated the power contained in Carcosa’s mask.</p>, <p>[The unique effect of the L-rank accessory ‘Carcosa’s Mask’, ‘Madman’s Dexterity’, has been activated.]</p>, <p>Terrible screams began to echo from the dark basement of this “mad mage”.</p>, <p>It was the dreadful scream of a non-human entity.</p>, <p>The next day.</p>, <p>I finally returned to the Geumchon neighborhood after a long while.</p>, <p>“Mage-nim.”</p>, <p>“Yes?”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok, who was driving, spoke with a serious expression on his face.</p>, <p>“Are you really going to keep calling me for this kind of job…?”</p>, <p>“You make easy money too, isn’t that nice?”</p>, <p>“Well, it’s nice since you pay well considering the distance…”</p>, <p>A secure taxi is a service that can be found only in certain dangerous areas like Paju, even in [Cthulhu World].</p>, <p>Compared to regular taxis, they provided much stronger security and safety but charged exorbitant rates.</p>, <p>Instead of charging based on distance like regular taxis, secure taxis charged based on the level of danger.</p>, <p>“Just keep driving for me until I buy a car.”</p>, <p>“Do you have a driver’s license?”</p>, <p>“I don’t.”</p>, <p>“Um…”</p>, <p>Jang Hyeon-deok stopped talking for a moment and he had a puzzled expression on his face.</p>, <p>The silence was brief, and he continued to grumble afterward. However, as I was about to get out of his car, Jang Hyeon-deok made a suggestion.</p>, <p>“I’ll be driving around the area running a regular taxi business for a while, so call me if you need anything.”</p>, <p>“Alright.”</p>, <p>Despite his grumbling, it seemed that was going to be the outcome anyway.</p>, <p>After I left Jang Hyeon-deok, I mounted the board I had brought with me and entered the dark alleys of the Geumchon neighborhood.</p>, <p>My destination today was Vasilisa.</p>, <p>Just yesterday, I finally received the call I had been waiting for from Tudor.</p>, <p>When I entered Vasilisa, I was surprised by the unusually large crowd.</p>, <p>The café was typically filled with burly mercenaries and grim fixers, but today it was exceptionally crowded.</p>, <p>Every table was occupied, and people who couldn’t find a seat leaned against the walls.</p>, <p>There were various weapons and magical powers.</p>, <p>Not only Koreans but also foreigners of different skin colors and in diverse attire were present.</p>, <p>They were fixers and each with their own unique skills.</p>, <p>In this chaotic gathering of remarkable individuals, one person stood out conspicuously.</p>, <p>He was a remarkably neat and genteel middle-aged man who seemed out of place in the shop.</p>, <p>He was seated in a wheelchair and engaged in conversation with the people sitting across from him at the table.</p>, <p>His inherent magical power was nothing extraordinary, but there was an ominous aura emanating from somewhere within him.</p>, <p><em>Although it is suppressed … that’s a fierce venom. What has he brought with him?</em></p>, <p>As always, it was the first time I had seen him, but it wasn’t our first meeting in the true sense. The thought of acknowledging him crossed my mind, but I decided against it.</p>, <p>After all, he would soon be someone with whom I would engage in an excessively long conversation.</p>, <p>I turned around and headed towards the counter.</p>, <p>“Orb, hello?”</p>, <p>“Hel-lo? Shi-hwa. It’s-been-a-while.”</p>, <p>The reply came back in a voice that sounded mechanically spliced.</p>, <p>Over two meters tall with a huge monitor where a head should be.</p>, <p>And a smiley face was displayed on that monitor.</p>, <p>Orb was the barista of Vasilisa.</p>, <p>“It’s quite busy today, isn’t it?”</p>, <p>“Lately-it’s-been-busy. A boom-in-business”</p>, <p>Instead of the smiley, the symbols “¥€$” flickered on his monitor for a moment.</p>, <p>“You seem less busy than usual, Orb?”</p>, <p>“Probably-because-Tudor-is-busy.”</p>, <p>“Right. It’s unusual not to see Tudor around.”</p>, <p>Tudor who was always either lying in a corner of the shop or chatting with the customers was nowhere to be seen.</p>, <p>When I looked in front of Tudor’s office, there were a lot of muscular men with menacing eyes.</p>, <p>It looked like they were standing in line and waiting for a consultation, right?</p>, <p>A sudden boom in business.</p>, <p>Tudor who brokers jobs for illegal human resources being in a boom meant something catastrophic was slowly drawing closer to this world.</p>, <p><em>I had been keeping track of the dates, but this is happening sooner than expected?</em></p>, <p>I was a player.</p>, <p>So depending on the choices I make, who I fight, and whom I meet, a different main scenario emerges each time.</p>, <p>While the details of each main scenario may vary slightly, the most critical aspect remains unchanged.</p>, <p>A horrific catastrophe that will devastate this world is looming, and as a precursor, monsters and madmen begin to stir from the shadows of this world.</p>, <p>“Tudor-told-me that, if Shin-hwa-shows up, call me. Wait a bit.”</p>, <p>Orb circled the counter and slowly made his way toward Tudor’s office.</p>, <p><em>His walk is truly cool.</em></p>, <p>It’s a graceful and stylish stride that even runway fashion models would struggle to emulate.</p>, <p>He stood tall among the monstrous fixers. His upper body was shaped like an inverted triangle, his forearms were highlighted by prominent veins and muscles, and a tight black apron was wrapped around his waist.</p>, <p>From head to toe.</p>, <p>He was a finely selected barista that fit exactly Tudor’s taste.</p>, <p>Especially his head, I suppose.</p>, <p>After delivering a brief message in Tudor’s office, Orb made a gesture indicating Tudor would be out soon and returned to the counter.</p>, <p>“By the way, you didn’t see curtain call, did you?”</p>, <p>“Collie-went-to-Cheonan.”</p>, <p>The word “Cheonan” appeared on Orb’s monitor.</p>, <p>“Cheonan? Cheonan in South Chungcheong Province?”</p>, <p>“Yes.”</p>, <p>Cheonan, huh… What on earth could Curtain Call be doing there?</p>, <p>Whatever the job, Curtain Call excels at one thing and that is killing people.</p>, <p>In fact, it’s safe to say that’s the only thing she knows how to do.</p>, <p>No matter who hired Curtain Call, they could only ask her to kill people. Amitabha…</p>, <p>“Oh. Wasn’t there a Helistic factory there?”</p>, <p>As was the case with most properties owned by Helistic, very illegal and antisocial activities were conducted at that factory.</p>, <p>If you play out a story opposing Helistic, you can also enjoy an event where that factory gets destroyed.</p>, <p>While I was pondering all of this, Tudor’s voice suddenly rang out.</p>, <p>“Dear! Come in quickly!”</p>, <p>When I looked towards the source of the voice, I saw Tudor’s head just peeking out from the office door.</p>, <p>To the side, I saw those Mohican-like men in leather jackets chattering as they walked out.</p>, <p>It seems their consultation was over.</p>, <p>“Aren’t you busy?”</p>, <p>“Because it’s busy, come quickly!”</p>, <p>“Ah, yes. I’m on my way.”</p>, <p>Clearly, Tudor has been much busier recently.</p>, <p>The office which was usually a mess greeted me in an even more chaotic state than usual.</p>, <p>“Maybe you should ask Orb to tidy up?”</p>, <p>“I am tidying up. It was clean this morning.”</p>, <p>“…I see.”</p>, <p>“By the way, since I haven’t seen you in a while…”</p>, <p>Tudor paused and looked at me for a moment…</p>, <p>“Oh… Aren’t you amazing?”</p>, <p>She exclaimed awkwardly.</p>, <p>“What’s up? Why are you acting like that?”</p>, <p>“I knew you were getting stronger every time I saw you, but this time it’s no joke. What have you been picking up and eating?”</p>, <p>“What have I eaten?”</p>, <p>“The quality of your magic… it’s completely changed. It even smells of poison and corpses. It’s quite severe, isn’t it?”</p>, <p>I unconsciously lowered my head and looked down at my chest.</p>, <p>I did eat something.</p>, <p>[Echo of Suffocation (Legendary Elixir): A fragment of the power from the great old being, ‘He Who Comes from the Darkness’]</p>, <p>It was just a tiny fragment though. It was barely comparable to a clipped fingernail if measured by human standards.</p>, <p>But it was still a part of a being of the abyss.</p>, <p>Thanks to it, the already immense amount of magical power I possessed has nearly doubled, and the quality of my magic has improved beyond comparison.</p>, <p>Not only that but during the time I stayed reclusive at home, I came to realize and learn new things.</p>, <p>It seemed like she had noticed this change.</p>, <p>“Thanks to your help, I found some decent nourishing food to pick up.”</p>, <p>“Hmm… I’m envious. Next time, I hope you’ll include me too. It might even extend my lifespan.”</p>, <p>It wasn’t certain, but if the background information I had was correct, Tudor was older than even the Hollow Lord who was born during the reign of King Gojong.</p>, <p>I knew that dragging on this topic wouldn’t benefit me.</p>, <p>At this point, I decided to change the subject.</p>, <p>“Orb said that business has been booming lately.”</p>, <p>“Ah, yes. It’s been so busy I’m going crazy.”</p>, <p>“Sounds like something’s up?”</p>, <p>“There’s a lot of work, but you’re part of the reason too.”</p>, <p>“Me?”</p>, <p>“Yes, you. Right in front of me.”</p>, <p>Tudor smiled as if pleased and gestured towards my chest.</p>]\n"
