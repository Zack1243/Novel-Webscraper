            "[<p>Emotions.</p>, <p>A strong feeling (reaction) deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationship with others.</p>, <p>I never fully understood them.</p>, <p>They weren't foreign to me—Anger, Sadness, Fear, GuiltI've experienced them all. Plenty of times before.</p>, <p>As humans, we were inherently designed to feel them.</p>, <p>...But merely experiencing them didn't equate to understanding them.</p>, <p>[Don't worry. I'll make sure to make it quick.]</p>, <p>A certain voice hung in the air. It was gentle, yet carried a gravity that drew my attention.</p>, <p>Two lackluster gray eyes seemed fixed on me.</p>, <p>Or… felt like it. I knew that it wasn't possible since the one talking was inside the TV screen.</p>, <p>However, as I gazed into those eyes, I had a sudden thought—'Why does it feel like they're looking right at me?'</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>I shook my head.</p>, <p>Stupid.</p>, <p>[This is the last step, right?...The last step before my hell is finally over?]</p>, <p>He stood solitary, amidst the wreckage. The landscape lay strewn with debris and shattered structures. The world around him seemed to have halted, frozen in a moment in time.</p>, <p>In that instant, the dullness in his gaze faltered, and what appeared to replace it was something akin to... anguish.</p>, <p>Grief?</p>, <p>[...Hah]</p>, <p>The man clutched his shirt, slowly wrinkling it as his lips slowly curled into a hazy smile.</p>, <p>[I'll do it.]</p>, <p>His head lowered to meet another gaze.</p>, <p>[...]</p>, <p>With black hair, this person knelt on the ground with their back faced against the screen, gazing up at the gray-eyed man. No words escaped their lips; they simply stared.</p>, <p>Perhaps he wanted to say something, but couldn't. After all, a large gaping wound was present on his back.</p>, <p>[Ah, yes... I shouldn't drag this out.]</p>, <p>The gray-eyed man lifted his hand, unveiling the cold gleam of a sword. His lackluster gray eyes quivered ever so slightly as the blade descended down in one fluid motion.</p>, <p>SHIIING—!</p>, <p>[I've waited far too long for this.]</p>, <p>The screen turned black.</p>, <p>\"Umm… So what do you think?\"</p>, <p>I heard a familiar voice call out to me, and I lowered my gaze.</p>, <p>\"Not bad, I guess.\"</p>, <p>While I inherited more from our father, it was evident that he had drawn more from our mother. His auburn locks cascaded gracefully to his forehead, and his green eyes gazed back at me.</p>, <p>This kid, who was my only remaining family, was my brother; Noel Rowe.</p>, <p> \"Not bad? Just that…?\"</p>, <p>\"What do you want me to say?\"</p>, <p>I wasn't much of a gamer. In fact, I never had the time to play games. There were things I needed to prioritize in life; however, leisure was not one of them.</p>, <p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that I found the game uninteresting.</p>, <p>\"I mean… You can lie.\"</p>, <p>\"And why would I do that?\"</p>, <p>\"Because it's my favorite game.\"</p>, <p>\"Right…\"</p>, <p>What sort of reasoning was this?</p>, <p>I blinked slowly before reaching for my drink.</p>, <p>\"You know… I think it's best if you don't drink.\"</p>, <p>\"I don't care.\"</p>, <p>Taking hold of the glass cup, I felt its coarse texture beneath my fingers before slowly bringing it towards my lips.</p>, <p>As the glass drew nearer, my attention fixated on the brownish liquid it contained. It was whiskey, a choice that seemed fitting for the moment.</p>, <p>As I cast my gaze downward, my reflection stared back at me, giving me a glimpse of the person I had become.</p>, <p>Hollow eyes, a vanishing mane of hair, protruding cheekbones—my visage had become something I wasn't able to recognize.</p>, <p>Even my hand quivered as I clutched the cup.</p>, <p>'I've had better days…'</p>, <p>I smiled bitterly to myself.</p>, <p>Stage IV Lung Cancer.</p>, <p>Not a pretty disease.</p>, <p>I still remember to this day the numerous emotions I felt during the day I received the news. I was just 24 years old. How was it possible for me to get cancer? But there was no denying what was inside me.</p>, <p>So…</p>, <p>I just accepted it.</p>, <p>Acceptance didn't come quickly. At first, I fought. I changed my diet and underwent Chemotherapy. But my life became miserable from that point on.</p>, <p>All my savings started to drain, and each day seemed more hollow than the other.</p>, <p>That was when I accepted my situation and just stopped everything.</p>, <p>Okay, fine. I'm dying.</p>, <p>Still.</p>, <p>*Sip*</p>, <p>Why make what remained of my life a torture?</p>, <p>I might as well enjoy what remained of it. Even if it made my life shorter.</p>, <p>\"B..itter.\"</p>, <p>My chest burned and my hand trembled.</p>, <p>Despite that, I kept a firm grip on the glass and continued to sip on it. Every breath I took was laced with pain, yet the pain at the back of my throat held a strangely comforting allure.</p>, <p>So I focused my attention on it.</p>, <p>Relished it.</p>, <p>\"…Brother, are you really just going to drink like that?\"</p>, <p>Noel's worried voice reached my ears.</p>, <p>But despite his worry, I continued to drink.</p>, <p>\"Let me... be.\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and savored the pain at the back of my throat.</p>, <p>Only this way could I forget about the other pain that was constantly invading my body.</p>, <p>*Sip*</p>, <p>It hurt.</p>, <p>I felt so tired. I could barely move. And I felt so useless.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I felt comfortable.</p>, <p>Yes.</p>, <p>This is how it should be.</p>, <p>\"Cou…gh.\"</p>, <p>I was caught off-guard. I wasn't able to hold it. My chest pounded fiercely, and my hand visibly shook. It took every little bit of my willpower to not drop my glass.</p>, <p>\"Brother!\"</p>, <p>\"I'm… Cough! F-fine.\"</p>, <p>I opened my eyes to see Noel staring at me with a worried look.</p>, <p>My vision shook, and my hand almost gave out, but I held it in.</p>, <p>Staring back at him, I only felt guilt. He was only 16 years old. Our parents had died a long time ago, and I was his remaining family.</p>, <p>…I didn't want to leave him alone, but what choice did I have?</p>, <p>If I chose to stay longer, with what money was he going to survive?</p>, <p>In a way, stopping Chemotherapy wasn't just because I didn't want to prolong my suffering. It was also a way for me to leave him something before I left.</p>, <p>Rather than leaving him in debt and dying, I'd rather die and leave him with something to lean on.</p>, <p>It was my duty.</p>, <p>My duty as his brother.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>Tears streamed down his face as he gazed at me. The incessant buzzing in my head made it difficult to discern his words, but it appeared he was trying to call an ambulance.</p>, <p>I stopped him and shook my head before pointing toward the TV.</p>, <p>\"Tell me… Tell me about the game.\"</p>, <p>\"Game?\"</p>, <p>Seeing his reaction, I managed to force a smile.</p>, <p>\"Yea-h. Tell me why it's your favorite game?\"</p>, <p>He wouldn't stop talking about it.</p>, <p>\"That…\"</p>, <p>He looked unsure of what to say, but after glancing at me once more, he wiped his tears and started to recount everything.</p>, <p>\"The game is called Rise of the Three Calamities, and the main character is called Leon. He's an orphan and the story starts at Haven. An institute, or more like an Academy where cadets are trained for the future of the Nurs Ancifa Empire. One of the four great empires...\"</p>, <p>To be honest, I was only able to make out a couple of words. After a certain time, all I could see was his mouth moving, but I just nodded along.</p>, <p>For the sake of it. I had to pretend to be fine.</p>, <p>So just...</p>, <p>'Let me die faster.'</p>, <p>Time seemed to flow endlessly and before I knew it, Noel was standing by the door of the apartment.</p>, <p>\"Brother, I'm going to go grab some Lunch. I'll bring you your favorite.\"</p>, <p>That… I could hear.</p>, <p>And just as his hand grasped the door, his feet came to a sudden stop.</p>, <p>\"I'll see you soon… okay?\"</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>I answered back, albeit weakly.</p>, <p>\"Good.\"</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>The door closed and silence filtered across the room.</p>, <p>\"…\"</p>, <p>For some unknown reason, the silence brought a smile to my face.</p>, <p>My eyes slowly closed, and I relished in the silence.</p>, <p>\"Cough!...Cou..gh!\"</p>, <p>Yet that tranquility proved fleeting as I was seized by uncontrollable coughing. When I reopened my eyes and gazed down, I caught sight of my hands which were stained in blood.</p>, <p>My blood.</p>, <p>\"Sh...it.\"</p>, <p>A clink resonated in the air.</p>, <p>The cup in my grasp had finally tumbled to the ground, and the world began to whirl around me.</p>, <p>'Looks like I can't maintain the facade any longer.'</p>, <p>Whiskey spilled onto the floor, and my chest throbbed intensely with pain.</p>, <p>I had managed to hold back before, but such a thing was no longer possible as all energy drained from my body and I leaned back on my chair.</p>, <p>'It's good that he didn't see me in this state.'</p>, <p>Sometimes, one suffers in silence not out of embarrassment, but out of necessity.</p>, <p>How could I allow my brother to see this?</p>, <p>\"Ha..

            "[<p>'Uh... I'm still alive?'</p>, <p>There was no way. But... I was starting to doubt it. That was despite feeling certain that I had drawn my last breath.</p>, <p>It was the only logical conclusion I could make as I found myself standing on the remains of a city.</p>, <p>My sinuses clogged up as a result of the smoke that lingered in the air, and I heard a low, steady ringing in my head at the same time. Sort of like the buzz of a mosquito, but a lot more annoying than that.</p>, <p>With all of that taken into account, I was certain that there was something wrong with the situation. I felt there, yet not at the same time.</p>, <p>If that made any sense?</p>, <p>Must be some sort of hallucination one experiences before death.</p>, <p>It had to be.</p>, <p>I was more convinced of this when I found myself standing amidst the ruins of a city unknown to me, confused by the peculiar architecture of the buildings. They appeared to belong to a distinct era, unlike anything familiar to my own.</p>, <p>How weird.</p>, <p>The entire situation was weird and I had trouble wrapping my head around it.</p>, <p>Despite my eagerness in wanting to find out more about what was happening to me and what the city around me was, I couldn't.</p>, <p>I was stuck where I was.</p>, <p>Or more like, I was trapped.</p>, <p>I could see, smell, hear, taste, and touch just fine. It was just that, I had no control over my body. I felt as though I were a marionette, manipulated by an external force.</p>, <p>Rumble! Rumble!</p>, <p>My focus was captured by a distant rumble, prompting my head to turn toward the source of the sound. A voice unknown to me emerged, flowing from my lips.</p>, <p>\"It's about time... I thought they'd be slower.\"</p>, <p>There was something about the voice. It sounded unnatural. Almost robotic in my ears, but I couldn't quite tell.</p>, <p>Just what is happening?</p>, <p>I was flustered, but what else could I do? There was no way out for me, and all I could do was just observe.</p>, <p>BOOOM—!</p>, <p>A distant building disintegrated, and from within its ruins emerged a particular figure.</p>, <p>Our eyes met, and I instantly sensed an overwhelming weight pressing down on my body, stifling me.</p>, <p>\"I... finally found you!\"</p>, <p>A screeching voice reverberated through the air and the sky turned a scarlet color.</p>, <p>The pressure that bore down on me increased, and she soon appeared before my very eyes.</p>, <p>She was... breathtaking.</p>, <p>More so than anyone I'd ever seen in my life, making me further question the validity of what I was seeing.</p>, <p>Adorned with flowing, fiery red locks cascading down her back, her hair danced in the sunlight, displaying hues of crimson, copper, and gold, as if flames had been artfully woven into the fibers of her hair.</p>, <p>But it was her eyes that truly caught my attention. Gleaming like golden orbs, they possess a depth and brilliance that seemed to reflect the distant sun.</p>, <p>'Just what is happening?...and why is she looking at me like that?'</p>, <p>She seemed eerily familiar, yet at the same time wasn't. I more or less knew that I had seen her before, but I couldn't quite picture when.</p>, <p>\"Is that all you have to say to me?\"</p>, <p>Her gaze contained a little something. I couldn't quite understand what it was... perhaps longing? Disappointment? I wasn't too sure.</p>, <p> \"H—\"</p>, <p>My mouth had just parted open when all of a sudden, the sky which had previously dyed red, turned a purplish hue, and lightning began to crackle down from the sky.</p>, <p>Cracka! Cracka!</p>, <p>It tore at everything beneath, destroying the buildings and infrastructures with an unstoppable might.</p>, <p>In a matter of moments, the clouds ruptured, unveiling the silhouette of a woman. Her vibrant purple hair swayed gracefully through the expanse of the sky, while her piercing gaze, brimming with an overwhelming sense of animosity, fixated upon me.</p>, <p>Cracka! Cracka!</p>, <p>The sky continued to be ravaged by relentless lightning, intensifying the pressure that oppressed every inch of my being. The force was so formidable that my legs nearly buckled beneath me.</p>, <p>Yet, inexplicably, the individual I was presently \"possessing\" displayed unwavering stubbornness. My bones cracked, and I was having a hard time breathing under the extreme pressure.</p>, <p>Yet.</p>, <p>As if what I was experiencing meant nothing.</p>, <p>I remained standing where I was.</p>, <p>\"So... you're finally here too.\"</p>, <p>His voice carried through the air, reaching the woman with lustrous, purple hair suspended in mid-air.</p>, <p>The lightning surrounding her crackled with increased intensity, while her gaze seethed with amplified hatred. However, she remained immobile, as if she couldn't move at all.</p>, <p>That was when I felt my lips curl, and the world underwent another change.</p>, <p>From Red to Purple... to Black.</p>, <p>Abruptly, darkness engulfed my sight, causing the distant city to vanish entirely. The sky dissipated, and everything in my surroundings vanished, leaving only the two women ahead of me.</p>, <p>Emerging from the depths of the inky abyss, a figure took shape in the distance. Her eyes, a vivid shade of crimson, radiated with an intense luminosity that pierced through the darkness, unveiling a cascade of snowy white hair flowing down her shoulders.</p>, <p>She too...</p>, <p>Looked at me with nothing but hatred.</p>, <p>Ah... I get it now.</p>, <p>Her appearance was what it took to make me understand.</p>, <p>Understand why they felt so familiar to me before.</p>, <p>'They're the same girls from the game that my brother showed me before.'</p>, <p>Just before my death. There was one game my brother continued to talk about. 'Rise of the Three Calamities.'</p>, <p>I didn't know much about the game as I never got the chance to play it, but it was something my brother was enthusiastic about.</p>, <p>He wouldn't stop talking about it…</p>, <p>The pieces of the puzzle fell into place as soon as all three appeared before me, triggering a recollection of the game's cover. Although I had only glimpsed it briefly without giving it much thought, it took me a moment to jog my memory.</p>, <p>But now, I was certain.</p>, <p>The three women who stood in front of me... glaring at me with such hatred that made my heart palpitate, were the same Three Calamities that belonged to the game my brother showed me just before my death.</p>, <p>Or what I thought was my death. Was I still dead? I wasn't too sure anymore.</p>, <p>They were most likely the older version of the girls on the background of the cover.</p>, <p>Contrary to their youthful portrayal on the cover, the women before me appeared considerably older.</p>, <p>Their gazes deviated greatly from the playful depiction on the cover, radiating an unrelenting aura of bloodlust that seemed to want to eat me alive.</p>, <p>\"How long has it been since we've last been together?\"</p>, <p>My mouth parted. This time, I could hear the voice more clearly. It sounded oddly calm despite the situation he was in.</p>, <p>None of the girls spoke. They just stared at me with the same expressions on their faces.</p>, <p>My lips curled further.</p>, <p>\"I like those expressions.\"</p>, <p>My hand reached forward all of a sudden and a black chalice materialized, seemingly out of thin air, landing securely in my grasp. Enclosed within its confines, a peculiar black liquid resided.</p>, <p>Rumble—! Rumble—!</p>, <p>The appearance of the chalice seemed to have triggered something as the world suddenly started to quake fiercely.</p>, <p>The girls' expressions changed dramatically and the pressure that bore on me intensified.</p>, <p>Yet, despite it all. 'I' remained where I was.</p>, <p>\"S-stop!\"</p>, <p>\"Fuck, stop this bastard!\"</p>, <p>Strings of curses flew my way, but the only response was a slight raise of the cup.</p>, <p>\"Nooo!\"</p>, <p>As the chalice approached my lips, a fleeting moment allowed me to steal a glance at my own visage, mirrored within the depths of the dark liquid residing inside.</p>, <p>Handsome.</p>, <p>Was all I could think of as I stared at the man reflected within the liquid of the chalice.</p>, <p>'Is this me?'</p>, <p>There was an air of confidence and allure that emanated from him that perfectly matched the disposition he displayed.</p>, <p>His intense, hazel eyes held a mesmerizing depth, shimmering under the blackness of the liquid, matching his lustrous black hair. The strong, chiseled features of his face were accentuated by a well-defined jawline and a perfectly proportioned nose.</p>, <p>Never in my life had I ever seen anyone this handsome.</p>, <p>'Ha, I really must be dead...'</p>, <p>Rumble—! Rumble—!</p>, <p>The world around me seemed to completely crumble. Before I knew it, the three girls were already upon me. Coming from all sides.</p>, <p>Their power sent shivers down my spine.</p>, <p>But despite it all. 'I' remained where I was, feeling a slight curl at the end of my lips as the chalice drew to my mouth and I took a sip.</p>, <p>'It's bitter.'</p>, <p>Pfttt—!</p>, <p>At that very moment, as the initial sip of liquid touched my lips, a searing agony tore through me.</p>, <p>I felt something drip from the side of my mouth as my head slowly lowered. It was there that I caught a glimpse of a large sword.</p>, <p>It passed right through my chest.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>Red stained the top of the sword as it dripped from the corner of my mouth.</p>, <p>Slowly, my head turned, and it was there that I caught a glimpse of two dull grey eyes staring back at me.</p>, <p>\"Right. I forgot about you.\"</p>, <p>The words came flawlessly out of my mouth. As if nothing had happened. But I knew. I knew better than anyone that he was merely on his last straw.</p>, <p>Yet.</p>, <p>I remained standing. Proudly. In front of everyone.</p>, <p>Gulp—!</p>, <p>And with a gulp, the world around me turned dark.</p>, <p>The next moment I woke up, I found a large screen floating before my very eyes.</p>, <p>— ●[Julien D.

Evenus]● —</p>, <p>Something floated in front of me. I only caught a small glimpse of it. By the time I blinked, it was gone.</p>, <p>\"Ukh.\"</p>, <p>My head continued to throb.</p>, <p>How am I still alive...?</p>, <p> It didn't make sense.</p>, <p>The last memories I could recall were the last moments before my passing.</p>, <p>The exchange with my brother, the lingering scent in the room, and the bittersweet, yet smoky taste of the whisky coming down my throat.</p>, <p>\"How is this possible...?\"</p>, <p>As my vision cleared up, I tried to make out my surroundings.</p>, <p>It was an unfamiliar setting.</p>, <p>Nothing like I'd ever seen before.</p>, <p>My initial focus was drawn to the large desk right before me. It loomed large, dominating the space with its gleaming, well-polished wooden top.</p>, <p>Strangely, there appeared to be nothing resting atop the desk except for a vintage, antique night lamp, which emitted a soft, subdued glow, casting an eerie light across the room.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>A sudden noise jolted me from behind, and my body tensed. The back of my hair stood on end, and I flicked my head to look behind me.</p>, <p>Expecting the worst, my legs tensed as I readied to move out of my spot, but...</p>, <p>\"…No one?\"</p>, <p>I frowned.</p>, <p>There was nothing behind me except for a tall wooden bookshelf, adorned with a diverse array of books in various sizes and colors. Beneath it was a small book that seemed to have fallen to the ground.</p>, <p>It must've been the source of the noise.</p>, <p>\"Looks like I—Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>A sudden pain jolted me out of my thoughts. It pounded fiercely at my chest, and whatever words I was about to utter stopped.</p>, <p>\"Akkh...!\"</p>, <p>The pain was intense.</p>, <p>More than anything I had ever felt before. Every part of me shook, and my muscles started to spasm.</p>, <p>\"Ha… Akh...! What the…!\"</p>, <p>It was at that moment that I at last laid eyes on the sword jutting out from within my chest.</p>, <p>My entire body tensed as I felt every inch of my mind freeze at the sight that bore before my very eyes.</p>, <p>\"H... how?!\"</p>, <p>As if the scene from before replayed in my mind a sword appeared. It slowly clawed its way up from my back and into my body.</p>, <p>Horrified, I could only watch as the sword drew deeper into my body and pierced right through my chest.</p>, <p>I wanted to scream. Cling to something. Run.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>My body was frozen. I could only watch as the sword pierced through me, and pain invaded every inch of my body.</p>, <p>Blood trickled down my pristine white shirt, delicately drawing webs on my forearm before staining the wooden floor beneath, forming a muted puddle that gradually spread.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>Like the repetitive tick of a clock, the blood persistently trickled down to the ground.</p>, <p>The sight turned my stomach, and I could feel the color draining from my face.</p>, <p>It was the first time I had ever witnessed something so gruesome.</p>, <p>\"Haa… aha…\"</p>, <p>My breath started to feel heavy and my vision started to blur once more.</p>, <p>But before I knew it, the pain stopped. I didn't know when. I had long last track of time.</p>, <p>I extended my hand towards my back, where I could feel the hilt of the sword.</p>, <p>My fingers brushed against the soft leather grip that encased it, and for a moment, I contemplated pulling the sword out. But then, slowly, I withdrew my hand.</p>, <p>Despite the pain and the situation, I remained rational.</p>, <p>Yanking the blade from my chest would probably kill me. I knew that much.</p>, <p>\"H-haa...\"</p>, <p>My chest trembled as I took another break. As if I had swallowed lava, my chest burned with each breath.</p>, <p>Drip. Drip.</p>, <p>And blood continued to drip down from my chest.</p>, <p>When I finally found my voice again, I managed a soft mumble,</p>, <p>\"Is... this what hell feels like?\"</p>, <p>I wanted to laugh then and there.</p>, <p>Because.</p>, <p>\"I-t feels like shit.\"</p>, <p>But pain. I was used to pain. Every part of me hurt, but... compared to what I had been through the past few years, it was manageable.</p>, <p>I could take this much.</p>, <p>Sizzle~!</p>, <p>I believed it was over, but suddenly, a faint sizzling sound caught my attention. At that moment, a searing pain shot through my right forearm.</p>, <p>The pain was just as unbearable as the pain from before. It was entirely focused on my forearm.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I kept my mouth shut and stared at my forearm.</p>, <p>Pain I could deal with.</p>, <p>It wasn't anything new.</p>, <p>What grabbed my attention was the faint glow that formed on my forearm. On the spot where the pain was radiating.</p>, <p>Gradually, my eyebrows furrowed, and the glow on my forearm subsided.</p>, <p>\"...A tatoo?\"</p>, <p>A four-leaved clover was deeply etched on my forearm.</p>, <p>It looked like a cheap tattoo. It was all in black, and besides the soft glow that was slowly subsiding, there seemed nothing special about it.</p>, <p>The more I stared at it the more I felt like there was nothing special to it.</p>, <p>Uh...?</p>, <p>That was until all four leaves lit up with a strange white glow.</p>, <p>Stunned, I felt my eyes widen, and just before I could do anything, the world around me froze. I lost control of myself. I could no longer move, and everything around me gradually lost its color.</p>, <p>From the pool of blood beneath me, as though time were unwinding itself, the blood began to defy gravity, trickling upward and returning into my body.</p>, <p>\"...Uh.\"</p>, <p>Yet again, I was shocked. But I could do nothing.</p>, <p>I was stuck in place.</p>, <p>All I could do was watch as time seemed to reverse.</p>, <p>The elaborate blood patterns woven on my forearm began to shift and retract, seamlessly returning to my chest. Simultaneously, the sword that had penetrated my chest initiated a similar backward motion, gradually withdrawing from my chest.</p>, <p>I struggled to come to terms with what I was seeing and all sorts of thoughts flashed my mind, but...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>They all shattered when I heard the clanking sound of the sword behind me.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>The world regained its color, and I felt my breath again.</p>, <p>\"What...?\"</p>, <p>Everything around me was back to normal. From the book that fell from the bookshelf to the floor which was no longer stained in blood.</p>, <p>I remained seated where I was. Confused and dazed. It took me a moment to recover my bearings, and when I did, the first thing I did was stare at the sword that was lying on the floor.</p>, <p>There was something about it that felt unsettling to me.</p>, <p>It was as if there was a certain connection that linked between it and me. One that I couldn't explain.</p>, <p>Just as I was about to move to pick it up...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>The door to the room opened.</p>, <p>\"Young master.\"</p>, <p>A cold and even voice echoed within the confines of the room. It was a familiar voice. One which I vaguely remembered hearing before.</p>, <p>When I turned my head, my hair stood on end.</p>, <p>What...</p>, <p>Two dull gray eyes stared back at me.</p>, <p>For a moment, my thoughts stopped. Why is he here? Who is he...? And where am I?</p>, <p>The man from the vision.</p>, <p>The man from the game.</p>, <p>And the man who killed me in the vision.</p>, <p>\"They've called your name. It's your turn to take the test.\"</p>, <p>Why was he standing before me?</p>, <p>And why did it feel so real?</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I've finally lost it, haven't I?</p>, <p>I wanted to laugh but found myself unable to.</p>, <p>\"Young master?\"</p>, <p>As if my actions seemed weird, he tilted his head.</p>, <p>\"Are you okay...? Your face looks a little pale.\"</p>, <p>He took a step to approach me but I raised my hand to stop him. Recollections of the last memory kept replaying in my mind over and over again. As if it was a tape on repeat.</p>, <p>I had so many questions I wanted to ask him but kept my mouth shut.</p>, <p>My instincts, or more like, brain, was telling me that it wasn't a good idea.</p>, <p>\"Young master...?\"</p>, <p>And just as my name was called out again and he was about to approach me, I helped myself up from the chair.</p>, <p>\"Lead the way.\"</p>]\n",

In case of failure, he is prepared to exonerate you from the family.\"</p>, <p>His cold and even tone resounded across the empty corridor as he moved ahead of me.</p>, <p>I remained silent throughout the entire time.</p>, <p>\"It's important that you pass the examination. I can't stress that enough. For my sake as well.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Examination?</p>, <p>What examination?</p>, <p>I strained my ears and listened attentively.

As I listened to his words, my eyes couldn't help but trace toward my surroundings.</p>, <p>What sort of place is this?</p>, <p>The corridor seemed vast. Large windows lit up the corridors with purple curtains draped around them. It gave off a medieval vibe.</p>, <p>But there was no way, right? How could it...</p>, <p>\"...We're here, young master.\"</p>, <p>I had no time to adjust myself to my surroundings before I found myself standing in front of a large wooden door.</p>, <p>My feet came to a halt and he pushed the door open to reveal a large hall where hundreds of people stood. They all lined up in an orderly manner, facing another door at the very end of the hall.</p>, <p>\"You are...?\"</p>, <p>A woman with short black hair and glasses approached me. She held a clipboard in her hand and scanned me up and down.</p>, <p>My heart grew tense at her appearance.</p>, <p>I thought back on her question, 'You are?' and found myself unable to answer.</p>, <p>I'd like to know that as well.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Even so, I kept my composure. We stood like that for a couple of seconds before her eyes fell on my chest where realization finally hit her.</p>, <p>\"Ah, you must be from the Evenus Barony.\"</p>, <p>She glanced at her clipboard.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus. I see you.\"</p>, <p> Julien Dacre Evenus?</p>, <p>Tapping the board, she smiled.</p>, <p>\"Please follow me. I'll lead you to the examiners.\"</p>, <p>I secretly sighed in relief before glancing back for a brief moment. My eyes met his for a moment and he nodded. I looked away and followed the lady.</p>, <p>She seemed to be leading me toward the large door in the distance. I could feel the gazes of those around me as I moved. However, I paid them no mind.</p>, <p>Not because I didn't want to, but because I couldn't spare them the thought.</p>, <p>The closer I was to the door the faster my heart started to beat.</p>, <p>The only thing I knew was that I had to take an examination. What sort of examination, I didn't know.</p>, <p>My palms felt sweaty and my legs felt like lead.</p>, <p>Each step felt heavier than the last.</p>, <p>The only reason I followed along was purely because the situation forced me to.</p>, <p>It felt like I had to move.</p>, <p>But what now?</p>, <p>What was I supposed to do now?</p>, <p>\"We're here. Please don't be too nervous. They won't bite.\"</p>, <p>The woman graciously opened the door, unveiling the expanse of a generously decorated room. Elegant paintings adorned the walls, flanking the space alongside pristine white pillars.</p>, <p>What grabbed my attention was the large wooden desk that sat in the middle of the room where four individuals sat. In front of them was a boy with blonde hair and blue eyes. He wore a strange uniform and stood upright in front of the four individuals.</p>, <p>I felt a terrifying pressure coming from the four of them, and amongst them, a woman with long flowing black hair grabbed my attention.</p>, <p>She seemed the center of the four people, not just because of her looks, but because of the aura she gave off.</p>, <p>She had something beyond her beauty... Something I couldn't quite explain.</p>, <p>Just what sort of...?</p>, <p>\"You must be Julien.\"</p>, <p>Her lips curled slightly as she glanced at the papers before her. Looking away, she pointed ahead.</p>, <p>\"You must be here for the examination. Please make your way toward the center.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I had no choice but to follow along.</p>, <p>It only became more evident to me that there was something wrong with the people in front of me when I closed in on them.

Silence pervaded over the pitch-black space with nothing in sight. It felt as if I was levitating in an endless and lonely space.</p>, <p>It felt suffocating.</p>, <p>I was stuck in place, floating in this endless darkness that seemed to stretch endlessly. My consciousness was blurry, but I was aware of everything that was happening around me.</p>, <p>Was everything I previously saw another vision?</p>, <p>Is this what death feels like?</p>, <p>...It felt lonely.</p>, <p>And cold.</p>, <p>'Ah.'</p>, <p>The sensation didn't carry on for long. All of a sudden, a current ran through my body, jolting my consciousness awake.</p>, <p>When I came to, I realized I could finally move my body again.</p>, <p>Even so.</p>, <p>My surroundings were still dark.</p>, <p>'Hello?'</p>, <p>I tried to speak, but my mouth refused to open.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I held onto my composure and pushed away the anxiety and fear that was creeping up on my mind. I didn't let the darkness eat away at my sanity.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>'Hm?'</p>, <p>Just as I regained my composure, I spotted a bright light in the distance. A light...? It grew brighter by the second, its glow basking me in warmth.</p>, <p>It felt comfortable.</p>, <p>To the extent that I found my eyes slowly closing in relaxation.</p>, <p>'...Uh?'</p>, <p>When I opened them again, I was stunned by the sight before me and I held my breath.</p>, <p>'A wheel?'</p>, <p>Six colors, and six words.</p>, <p>Red - Anger</p>, <p>Purple - Fear</p>, <p>Blue - Sadness</p>, <p>Green - Surprise</p>, <p>Orange - Love</p>, <p>Yellow - Joy</p>, <p>A long red arrow pointed upward, currently resting on the color red.</p>, <p>Anger.</p>, <p>'What is this...?'</p>, <p>The six basic human emotions? I remember studying this back in psychology class, but why...</p>, <p>Trrrrr--!</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>The wheel began to spin on its own.</p>, <p>'...What's going on?!'</p>, <p>The colors alternated between red, purple, blue, green, orange, and yellow... They spun and spun and spun.</p>, <p>A deep sense of unease held me rooted. My eyes were fixed on the red arrow that remained firm.</p>, <p>The wheel continued to spin, and the colors continued to alternate. Gradually, the wheel lost its momentum before finally stopping.</p>, <p>'Purple.'</p>, <p>Fear.</p>, <p>Now what? My palms were sweaty, and the deep sense of unease that gripped my body seemed even more prominent.</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>And I was right to feel that way.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, the ground beneath me quaked. I almost lost my footing, and just as I regained it, I was shocked to see buildings sprouting from the ground beneath.</p>, <p>\"What...? Uh?!\"</p>, <p>I held my mouth.</p>, <p>\"I can speak again?\"</p>, <p>No, not just that... I looked around me. I was surrounded by buildings. No, not quite. They seemed to be ruins. The architecture reminded me of the one from the vision, but they were covered in vines and moss.</p>, <p>I couldn't quite get a good grasp of it since it was dark outside. However, from the corner of my eyes, I could make out faint figures in the distance.</p>, <p>Shadows?</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>A shiver ran through me as the cold wind caressed my skin. I grew tense, feeling a sensation that was akin to the gentle touch of two fingers slowly crawling their way up my arm.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa...\"</p>, <p>I felt my breath grow heavy, and as I tried to swallow, I found myself unable to. Something had gripped my throat. Something imaginary.</p>, <p>It prevented me from swallowing.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>My chest trembled.</p>, <p>'There's nothing in front of me...'</p>, <p>So why...?</p>, <p>Why did I feel so scared?</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I gripped my shirt, slowly wrinkling it in the process. There, I could feel the beat of my heart.</p>, <p>It was fast.</p>, <p>Ba... Thump! Ba... Thump!</p>, <p>And loud.</p>, <p>\"Ha...\"</p>, <p>My breath followed its rhythm.</p>, <p>It went faster.</p>, <p>And faster.</p>, <p>faster....</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa.. Ha...\"</p>, <p>I was hyperventilating.</p>, <p>My palms were sweaty and sweat trickled down the side of my face.</p>, <p>Fear had gripped me.</p>, <p>It was slowly consuming me.</p>, <p>I could feel it.</p>, <p>But why?</p>, <p>'...I need to run. Get away from here.'</p>, <p>My legs started to move. All thoughts disappeared and I just ran. Faster. And faster. And faster...</p>, <p>Soon, I found myself sprinting forward. I ran as if my life depended on it. I didn't know why I was acting like this, but if there was something I knew it was that I needed to run.</p>, <p>Get as far away as possible.</p>, <p>\"Ukh..!\"</p>, <p>I stumbled several times, scraping my knees in the process, but each time, I'd pick myself back up again and continue to run. I ignored the burning sensation that came with each breath that I took.</p>, <p>The only thought I had in my mind was that I needed to run.</p>, <p>I needed to get away from the shadows.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa.... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I'd look back from time to time, catching sight of them each time. The distance between us remained constant. Are they not running out of breath as well?...I can't keep this up for long.</p>, <p>The pain that gripped my lungs intensified. It was as if I was breathing fire.</p>, <p>But I had to hold on.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>Not...</p>, <p>Bang--!</p>, <p>My face came smashing against a hard surface.</p>, <p>\"Uakh...!\"</p>, <p>Ignoring the pain, I looked up.</p>, <p>\"No, I....\"</p>, <p>A shadow appeared. Its appearance remained a mystery to me. It wobbled in front of me, staring down at me as if I were some sort of prey.</p>, <p>\"Ah... Don't...\"</p>, <p>The sense of fear that gripped me intensified.</p>, <p>It was almost suffocating.</p>, <p>\"I... I...\"</p>, <p>The words refused to leave my mouth.</p>, <p>And then.</p>, <p>\"Uekh!\"</p>, <p>The shadow reached out for my throat, gripping it tightly. My eyes bulged, and I felt my body grow limp.</p>, <p>Ah, no... I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'll die...!</p>, <p>The feeling of helplessness under its grip, the steady thump of my heart, the weakness, and the gripping fear--all of it was etched deeply into my mind during those last moments.</p>, <p>What I was experiencing...</p>, <p>It was real.</p>, <p>And then.</p>, <p>Cr Crack--!</p>, <p>I felt my neck snap and the world turned dark again.</p>, <p>Only for a brightness to suddenly engulf me.</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Examinee?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...?\"</p>, <p>I slowly raised my head. Four figures sat not far from where I was standing. They all stared at me with frowns while a young man with blonde hair stood not far from me.</p>, <p>'Isn't this...?'</p>, <p>Slowly lowering my head, I stared at my right forearm where the tattoo was. It no longer hurt, and it wasn't glowing anymore.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>My arm was trembling.</p>, <p>The emotions I felt before... They continued to linger over me. I couldn't get rid of the sensation. It felt suffocating.</p>, <p>I needed an outlet.</p>, <p>An outlet to let everything out.</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Is everything alright? We don't have all day.\"</p>, <p>One of the people seated in front of me, a bulky man with a red beard raised his eyebrow, pointing at the young man in front of me.</p>, <p>\"...Show as what you've got.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>My feet moved on their own.</p>, <p>As if I had finally found what I needed, I moved toward the young man in front of me. He was staring back at me with a frown. As if he was trying to say, 'What is he doing?'</p>, <p>But I didn't care.</p>, <p>I paid him no mind and continued forward.</p>, <p>Before I knew it, I was standing before him. Just as his mouth opened to say something, my hands reached out for his head, grasping both sides solidly. My hands were still shaking but I kept a firm grip on his head.</p>, <p>His expression changed.</p>, <p>\"You, what are you...!\"</p>, <p>But I didn't care.</p>, <p>Feeling the sides of his face, my mouth parted open as I softly mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Fear.\"</p>, <p>My mind blanked from then on.</p>, <p>I lost myself in the moment.</p>, <p>When I came to, I was standing in the same spot I was before. My hands were no longer shaking, and my mind seemed calmer.</p>, <p>Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"H-help...! Haa.. Haa...!\"</p>, <p>When I looked down, I was stunned to see the young man from before on the ground. His face was pale, and he held his head with both hands while mumbling things like, 'Ah... I'm sorry...! Ah...'</p>, <p>As our eyes met, his expression distorted and his pupils dilated.</p>, <p>\"Ahhh...! N-no...!\"</p>, <p>He hastily moved back.</p>, <p>What is going on...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>A small screen appeared in front of me.</p>, <p>That was when I understood.</p>, <p>Lvl 1.

            "[<p>Expectations were minimal before his entrance.</p>, <p>Behind their desk, the four examiners conversed with each other, reviewing the files of the examinees.</p>, <p>\"The overall talent level is lower than last year. It's rather disappointing if I'm being honest. At this rate, the other institutes within the empire will catch up to us.\"</p>, <p>The man with the red beard mumbled—Herman Chambers, a High-Wizard, and a man known for his discernible eye for talent. As such, he was put in a position of recruitment for the upcoming year at the Haven Institute.</p>, <p>Just by visualizing the flow of mana coming from an examinee's body, he could more or less tell if they were talented or not.</p>, <p>From the thickness, and its purity... He'd be able to discern the overall level of the examinee before they even performed.</p>, <p>\"Please bring the next examinee.\"</p>, <p>Compared to last year, the talents were severely lacking.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"We've found a couple of little monsters, haven't we?\"</p>, <p>There were a few exceptions.</p>, <p>And those few exceptions were far above the norm.</p>, <p>\"...I guess you're right.\"</p>, <p>Herman crossed his arms and leaned back on the chair. From the corner of his eyes, he glanced at the woman sitting beside him.</p>, <p>She adorned herself in formal attire, exuding a near-perfect aura. Her captivating presence left a profound impact on those around her. The flawless combination of appearance and clothing made her stand out from the rest.</p>, <p>Delilah V. Rosemberg.</p>, <p>There were no imperfections or voids in her, to the extent that she appeared to embody perfection itself.</p>, <p>Elegance seamlessly permeated her every action, word, and facial expression, defining her entire being.</p>, <p>She was an unreachable being to many.</p>, <p>Apprentice at 18.</p>, <p>Master-Mage at 19.</p>, <p>High-Wizard at 21.</p>, <p>Arch-Wizard at 24.</p>, <p>And one of the Empire's Seven Monarchs at 27.</p>, <p>Many foresaw her as the future of the Empire, destined to fill a position that had remained vacant for centuries—the most formidable mage among them all.</p>, <p>The Zenith.</p>, <p>'How can someone like her work here...?'</p>, <p>Such a question stumped many, Herman included, but whenever someone asked, all she'd return was an empty smile.</p>, <p>She wasn't a woman of many emotions, but when she did show emotions...</p>, <p>One'd feel chills.</p>, <p>\"...Our next examinee should be from a Barony.\"</p>, <p>Her crisp and clean tone rang in the room. It lacked substance and yet seemed to pressure at the same time.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus.\"</p>, <p>She mumbled a name, almost chewing on it as her eyes lingered over the document in front of her.</p>, <p>\"Talent. Elemental and... Emotive.\"</p>, <p> \"Emotive?\"</p>, <p>Herman raised his brow and picked up the document in front of him. 'Indeed, he has talent in the emotive field...' His expectations diminished.</p>, <p>It wasn't that he hated Emotive Mages, or looked down on them.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"It's tough.\"</p>, <p>Muttering with crossed arms and a dismissive shake of her head, Cathrine Riley Graham, a middle-aged woman with long flowing brown hair, expressed her thoughts.</p>, <p>\"An emotive Mage deals with the manipulation of emotion. It's not a rare talent, but...\"</p>, <p>Pursing her lips, she halted mid-sentence, allowing for another voice to complete the sentence for her.</p>, <p>\"...One might lose themselves if they immerse themselves too much into the study of emotions.\"</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>The Emotive field was a dangerous field. To study emotions... Understand them. One had to immerse themselves in them.</p>, <p>Immerse yourself too much... and you might end up losing sight of yourself.</p>, <p>\"I've seen my fair share of talented ones lose their minds trying to further their path. It's unfortunate. Really unfortunate...\"</p>, <p>\"Well, at least he's talented in the Elemental field. Curse Magic? Not a bad field.\"</p>, <p>There were no bad elements.</p>, <p>Only bad people.</p>, <p>Closely examining the paper in front of him, the door to the room opened. A young man in his late teens entered.</p>, <p>\"You must be Julien.\"</p>, <p>Delilah spoke, her crisp and clean voice ringing throughout the room.</p>, <p>His appearance grabbed the attention of all present.</p>, <p>'He's handsome, but... disappointing.\"</p>, <p>Herman's first impression of Julien was one of disappointment.</p>, <p>'His mana flow is irregular. The density is light and he doesn't seem to have control over it.'</p>, <p>Was he really a noble? As if he wasn't the only one who thought this, Catherine mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Seems like this one is a bit of a bust. Disappointing considering that he's a noble.\"</p>, <p>Herbert Newberman, sitting on Herman's right, shared similar thoughts with her.</p>, <p>\"His mana flow is all over the place. At first glance, he doesn't seem to know how to properly utilize mana. What a rough batch...\"</p>, <p>In the mind of the examiners, Julien seemed to have come in vain. His performance was going to be one that they'd need to erase from their minds.</p>, <p>But if there was one thing to take note of, it was his demeanor.</p>, <p>The way he carried himself... His expressionless face, and calm even steps...</p>, <p>It seemed to exude boundless confidence.</p>, <p>An overconfident idiot?</p>, <p>'Well, whatever. Let's get this over with. I've seen worse.'</p>, <p>Herman nudged the young man that stood in front of them.</p>, <p>\"Jason, go test him.\"</p>, <p>He was a first-year, or more like second-year now... cadet. He wasn't exactly the most talented cadet, but to test new examinees he was good enough.</p>, <p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p>, <p>Jason began to move, but just as he had taken a step forward, his face changed.</p>, <p>So did that of all the examiners.</p>, <p>\"What is he doing?\"</p>, <p>\"...Is he checking his pulse?\"</p>, <p>\"What sort of nonsense is this?\"</p>, <p>With a blank expression and finger pressed against his forearm, Julien stared ahead. He seemed out of it.</p>, <p>His face was blank.</p>, <p>Like that of an empty sheet of paper.</p>, <p>\"What is this guy doing...?\"</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Examinee?\"</p>, <p>Herman called out for him several times until he snapped out of it.</p>, <p>\"Ah...?\"</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Is everything alright? We don't have all day.\"</p>, <p>He irritably pointed at Jason.</p>, <p>\"...Show as what you've got.\"</p>, <p>Just as Herman pointed at Jason, a sudden change occurred with Julien. His pupils dilated. His face paled, and his arms began to tremble.</p>, <p>His sudden change took everyone aback.</p>, <p>Julien's eyes trembled, darting around hastily with an air of desperation. He seemed to transform all of a sudden, a complete difference from how he previously was.</p>, <p>His shoulders shrunk and his breathing quickened.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Everyone could feel the rhythm of his breath.</p>, <p>It was getting faster with each breath.</p>, <p>He seemed to be the embodiment of a certain emotion.</p>, <p>What emotion...?</p>, <p>Ah.</p>, <p>It soon became clear to everyone.</p>, <p>'Fear.'</p>, <p>He had started to embody fear.</p>, <p>Herman felt a chill run down his body.</p>, <p>Not just him, but the other examiners too.</p>, <p>\"You, what are you...!\"</p>, <p>Julien walked up to Jason. Perhaps taken aback by the situation, he wasn't able to react on time. Julien's hands came pressing against his skull, squeezing almost.</p>, <p>And,</p>, <p>\"Ahhhhhh...!!!!\"</p>, <p>A scream shook the room.</p>, <p>It pierced through it and reverberated loudly in the ears of everyone present.</p>, <p>Suddenly, everyone in the room was motionless, not just Herman, Herbert, and Catherine, but Delilah too.</p>, <p>The impact of Julien's action was just that powerful.</p>, <p>With one single action, he left everyone in the room frozen.</p>, <p>\"Ah...! No! Ahhhhh...! I don't want to die, no!!!\"</p>, <p>It was intense, and one could vividly feel the fear that Jason was feeling.</p>, <p>Goosebumps.</p>, <p>Herman felt goosebumps.</p>, <p>\"Ahhh...!\"</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>Jason fell liplessly to the floor.</p>, <p>Shaking uncontrollably, he clutched his head while writhing on the floor. Saliva spilled from his mouth.</p>, <p>\"H...Help...!\"</p>, <p>Despite his cries, none of the examiners moved.</p>, <p>All eyes were fixed on the young man that stood before them.</p>, <p>What was in front of them was the embodiment of someone who threaded a path hardly anyone took.</p>, <p>Recalling, Herman mumbled out loud,</p>, <p>\"For one to understand an emotion one must experience it.\"</p>, <p>To display such fear, one must experience it. Everyone in the room was well-versed and knew this much.</p>, <p>They had traveled all over the continent and met many Emotive Mages. From there, they learned of the harshness that one who threads such a path must endure.</p>, <p>To experience fear, one must relentlessly chase after it.</p>, <p>Many failed in their paths, dying in the middle of training, or simply not being able to understand the emotion.</p>, <p>And yet,</p>, <p>\"What sort of gruesome training did he undergo to display such emotion?\"</p>, <p>Julien was able to do what many couldn't. He was far from perfection, but to be able to do this at such an age...</p>, <p>'Just how harsh has he been on himself?'</p>, <p>Herman's evaluation of Julien underwent a drastic change.</p>, <p>'Not only is he able to perfectly portray fear, but he also seems to have mastered the state of immersion.'</p>, <p>A state many Emotive Mages chased after. A state where one could separate reality and immersion.</p>, <p>Was that why he checked his pulse beforehand?</p>, <p>To check his condition before immersion?</p>, <p>'A monster.'</p>, <p>He was a total monster.</p>, <p>\"If I may ask...\"</p>, <p>Catherine was the first to truly break the silence that took hold of the room, briefly glancing at the trembling Jason on the ground before settling her gaze over to Julien.</p>, <p>\"What sort of training did you do to be able to do this? And is it only limited to fear?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Her question was met with silence as Julien stood still.</p>, <p>He then lowered his head and shook his head.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>'Was it so bad that he doesn't want to talk about it?'</p>, <p>The judges felt their expressions harden.</p>, <p>And finally, Delilah, who had been quiet the entire time, with her gaze seemingly never detaching from Juline, opened her mouth to speak,</p>, <p>\"You're dismissed. We'll let you know your results after we've evaluated all the examinees.\"</p>, <p>Julien nodded his head and calmly walked out of the room. It was as if he hadn't done anything worth praising over.</p>, <p>When he left, Herman and the others looked at her.</p>, <p>\"Why did you let him go like that? We were still busy ex—\"</p>, <p>\"Take a look at the floor.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>And that was when everyone finally realized.</p>, <p>\"Ah...! Pl-please help me... Ah...\"</p>, <p>\"He's in no state to continue with the examination. Tell someone to replace him and send him to the infirmary. For now, we'll take a break.\"</p>, <p>\"But...!\"</p>, <p>\"I know what you want to say.\"</p>, <p>Delilah raised her hand to stop the other examiners from speaking.</p>, <p>\"You want to know more about him, right?\"</p>, <p>When Herman and the others nodded, Delilah turned to look at the door where Julien had left.</p>, <p>Her gaze told a thousand words.</p>, <p>Herman could tell.</p>, <p>Like the rest of them, her interest had been piqued.</p>, <p>Without a doubt, she wanted to know what everyone in the room wanted to know.</p>, <p>A question none of them dared to ask.</p>, <p>To what extent had he immersed himself?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Everything was a blur to me.</p>, <p>From the moment I poured out everything to what unfolded next, my mind felt shrouded in a perpetual fog.</p>, <p>I couldn't think straight.</p>, <p>\"What sort of training did you do to be able to do this? And is it only limited to fear?\"</p>, <p>My sole focus was getting out of here.</p>, <p>I could feel it from deep within me. I still hadn't let it all out. It was lingering within my mind, slowly creeping its way up.</p>, <p>'I need to leave...'</p>, <p>So, then,</p>, <p>\"You're dismissed. We'll let you know your results after we've evaluated all the examinees.\"</p>, <p>When the chance presented itself, I spared no time and left. Coming out, I felt the stares of everyone in the hall fall on me, but yet again, I could pay them no mind.</p>, <p>'I need to find somewhere safe... A bathroom, or room. I can't...!'</p>, <p>My steps faltered momentarily. I felt something rising from my stomach. Swallowing back, I forced myself forward.</p>, <p>\"Move.\"</p>, <p>I pushed everyone in front of me away and continued forward.</p>, <p>\"Hey...!\"</p>, <p>I didn't care about their protests.</p>, <p>A bathroom... A room... Something...</p>, <p>I continued to walk. I didn't care to look where I was. I only stopped when I found a room. Glancing around, I entered.</p>, <p>It was a small room.</p>, <p>\"Haa...

As if he was dragging me deeper and deeper into the water.</p>, <p>I thought about running but realized it was futile.</p>, <p>There was no running from this man.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>I didn't feel like running.</p>, <p>Step—</p>, <p>He stood in front of me.</p>, <p>His eyes were intense.

You're in no state to think about the speech.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>I reached for the nearest tissue to clean up my nose. It was still leaking blood. As expected, I had been practicing a little too hard.</p>, <p>Leon stood quietly beside me.</p>, <p>Closely observing me.</p>, <p>That was until,</p>, <p>\"I'll take my leave.

I knew exactly why he was like that, and I took full advantage of it.</p>, <p>\"I don't have much time.\"</p>, <p>But I knew that I couldn't keep the facade for much longer.</p>, <p>It wouldn't take too long for him to understand that he could kill me with a thought. That was why I was so desperate for progression.</p>, <p>Only through power would I be able to keep myself alive.</p>, <p>\"...I should go.\"</p>, <p>I checked my watch.</p>, <p>It was almost time for me to give my speech. It wasn't as though I was nervous. I was far from it.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"What then...?\"</p>, <p>My goal was to find answers. And despite a week having passed, the only thing I managed to gain was even more questions.</p>, <p>This was indeed the world of 'Rise of the Three Calamities'.</p>, <p>Although I had never played the game, the situation became clear to me after experiencing the world for the past week.</p>, <p>In the week, I continuously thought about leaving this place.</p>, <p>The vision that preceded my arrival here depicted me getting killed by a long blade, with three women in pursuit.</p>, <p>Was the vision the Julien of the future, or was it me of the future...?</p>, <p>Even if it was, how long did I have before Leon killed me?</p>, <p>\"...Regardless of the outcome, it seems like every move I make leads to my death.\"</p>, <p>For such a future, wasn't the appropriate answer to just run away? Leave this place. Surely, I'd be able to live a good life if I did.</p>, <p>\"...As if.\"</p>, <p>The thought of not knowing why I was here seemed to eat at me more than my desire to live.</p>, <p>I guess, having already died once, I placed less importance on my life than the truth.</p>, <p>\"That's not all...\"</p>, <p>My eyes wandered back to my arm.</p>, <p>Turning it, a four-leaved clover entered my sight.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>One of the leaves lit up.</p>, <p>A feeling of dread welled up within the depths of my mind as my gaze remained fixed on the leaf. It was the same leaf from last time.</p>, <p>It reminded me of the time during the examination.</p>, <p>The leaf was the reason why I was able to become the Black Star.</p>, <p>I still didn't know what it did.</p>, <p>By the time I woke up the next day, it had lit up again. I hadn't touched it since. The lingering aftereffects of the situation were still affecting me. Was my mind even capable of withstanding such intense emotions again...?</p>, <p>I wasn't quite sure.</p>, <p>But if there was one thing that I knew...</p>, <p>\"Emotions.\"</p>, <p>Anger, sadness, joy, love, surprise, fear...</p>, <p>\"...I won't be consumed.\"</p>, <p>Rustle</p>, <p>I donned a black blazer and black leather gloves to hide the wounds on my hands.

Clad in a matching blazer, a sword at his hip, he casually brushed his hair.</p>, <p>\"We'll be late if we don't hurry.\"</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>The two of us walked on the empty streets.</p>, <p>Tak</p>, <p>The gentle click of our heels echoed in the air.</p>, <p>He walked by my side, maintaining a respectable distance. That was his duty as Julien's designated knight.</p>, <p>The city we were in was called Lens.</p>, <p>It was the nearest city to Haven and our temporary residence. Currently, being early in the morning, there weren't many people outside.</p>, <p>The cobblestone streets were empty.</p>, <p>It was just the two of us.</p>, <p>\"We're here.\"</p>, <p>We didn't walk far. Our destination was merely a few minutes away from the residence, located near the city center. Unlike the streets, this place was packed with people.</p>, <p>Leon handed me a small paper.</p>, <p>\"Here's your ticket.\"</p>, <p>\"Thanks.\"</p>, <p>One that I took.</p>, <p>Rather than a knight, secretary seemed more fitting for him.</p>, <p>\"Wow.\"</p>, <p>I stopped in my tracks to stare ahead.</p>, <p>I was still having a hard time getting used to the sight before me.</p>, <p>A means of transportation unfitting for a world like this. One that seemed to function even better than the locomotives in the modern age.</p>, <p>\"...This really is a game.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm? Did you say something?\"</p>, <p>\"Nothing.\"</p>, <p>I boarded the train, making my way toward my cabin. [A-25] Ah... Right here. It was rather spacious and had a wide window for me to look at.</p>, <p>From there, I could see the scenery outside. The lush trees, the tall mountains in the distance, and the orange glow that dyed the sky.</p>, <p>...It felt peaceful.</p>, <p>\"How is it? Is it to your satisfaction young master?\"</p>, <p>Leon's voice brought me back. I turned to glance at him.</p>, <p>\"You can drop the act when it's just us.\"</p>, <p>The whole 'young master' thing felt rather uncomfortable. I wasn't Julien. He didn't have to call me that.</p>, <p>\"I'd rather not.\"</p>, <p>\"Suit yourself.\"</p>, <p>But he seemed insistent on calling me that.</p>, <p>I wasn't going to force him.</p>, <p>There were other things that I needed to pay more attention to.</p>, <p>Like,</p>, <p>How would Julien conduct himself if he were to give a speech?</p>, <p>The speech.</p>, <p>As Leon said. I needed to act closely as the previous Julien acted. In this world, possessing someone else's body wasn't merely a fantasy.</p>, <p>Many were capable of such a feat. Some for looks, and others for longevity reasons.</p>, <p>Unless I acted like Julien, then there was a chance someone might find out.</p>, <p>I couldn't allow that to happen.</p>, <p>\"Here's the speech.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, I wasn't completely unprepared. Having discussed it with Leon, he already had a speech prepared for me.</p>, <p>\".....Ah, thanks.\"</p>, <p>I opened the paper to see the speech. A quick scan and I didn't see anything wrong with it. In fact, it was quite short.</p>, <p>Is this good enough...?</p>, <p>\"I could've prepared the speech by myself.\"</p>, <p>Things would've probably been easier for me if that was the case.</p>, <p>\"Maybe.\"</p>, <p>Maybe...?</p>, <p>\"I just didn't want to take any risks.\"</p>, <p>\"Then couldn't I have just shown you my speech while you helped me correct along the way?\"</p>, <p>\"That would've taken longer.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I chose to leave the subject there. It didn't seem like my words were getting through to him.</p>, <p>He doesn't trust me at all.</p>, <p>Noted.</p>, <p>I shifted my attention back to the speech. It wasn't long and also wasn't hard to memorize. I could learn this.</p>, <p>While I immersed myself in the speech, the train started to move.</p>, <p>The pistons roared and the train picked up speed.</p>, <p>I naturally turned my head to look at the window.</p>, <p>Unknowingly, the paper in my hand wrinkled.</p>, <p>Rustle</p>, <p>Finally.</p>, <p>I was walking into the devil's den.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Haven, Leoni Hall.</p>, <p>His presence grabbed the eyes of all in attendance.</p>, <p>An exquisite appearance that stood out from the rest. Clad in clothing that highlighted his lean and muscular physique, his appearance imprinted itself in the minds of all present.</p>, <p>He strode with measured steps, reaching the center of the podium.</p>, <p>\"The Black Star.\"</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>\"...He's here.\"</p>, <p>A fact Aoife was made aware of the moment his name was called out.</p>, <p>Her gaze traced over his body. His every action, movement, expression... she marked them in her mind, making sure to miss nothing.</p>, <p>He was the one who took the title away from her. Someone her cousin and the institute's board seemed enamored with.</p>, <p>And the one that stood above her.</p>, <p>「It's a pleasure to be standing here amongst all of you.」</p>, <p>His tone felt rather flat.</p>, <p>It lacked any highs and lows, sounding rather indifferent.</p>, <p>「It is with great honor that I find myself in this position.」</p>, <p>As if he didn't mean the words that he was saying.</p>, <p>That was what Aoife thought at first. However, all of a sudden Julien's gaze shifted.</p>, <p>「Many of you stand at the very peak of the Empire. Proud sons of heaven...」</p>, <p>It turned sharp.</p>, <p>「Everywhere you go, people will praise you. Call you the elites of the Empire.」</p>, <p>Like that of a sharpened blade.</p>, <p>「Someone that should be worshiped.」</p>, <p>Stabbing right at those present in the hall.</p>, <p>「But...」</p>, <p>He suddenly paused, and just faintly, Aoife noticed a change. His lips... They were pulled into a smile.</p>, <p>「Remember.」</p>, <p>And as his gaze swept the hall,</p>, <p>He slowly muttered,</p>, <p>「I stand above you.」</p>, <p>The entire hall fell into a state of silence.</p>, <p>Aoife's expression underwent a small change.</p>, <p>\"What is he.....\"</p>, <p>She looked around her. All the cadets wore similar expressions. One of utter shock which soon morphed into anger.</p>, <p>The previously quiet hall started to heat up.</p>, <p>\"What did he just say...?\"</p>, <p>\"Who is this arrogant bastard?\"</p>, <p>\"Did he just say that?\"</p>, <p>Aoife took in the sight around her. The disorder and chaos that was slowly taking shape. The flustered and shocked looks of the professors. The angered looks of the cadets.</p>, <p>.....And the stoic, yet arrogant look of the Black Star who stood at the center of it all.</p>, <p>\"This isn't right.\"</p>, <p>The Black Star was supposed to be a leading figure.</p>, <p>Someone the other cadets looked up to.</p>, <p>And yet,</p>, <p>Aoife tore her gaze away from the chaos happening around her and closed her eyes.</p>, <p>\"As expected...\"</p>, <p>Her fists slowly started to clench.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus.\"</p>, <p>He wasn't fit to be the Black Star.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The weight of over a hundred eyes weighed heavily on me. My every action seemed to be closely scrutinized.</p>, <p>From the way I walked, the way I looked, and the way I spoke.</p>, <p>All of it was assessed.</p>, <p>But even so, I didn't feel nervous. I had been a salesman in my past life. Things like this weren't a problem for me.</p>, <p>I tapped on the small ball in front of me.</p>, <p>\"It's a pleasure to be standing here amongst all of you.\"</p>, <p>It appeared to be a microphone. My voice echoed throughout the hall, reaching the ears of all present.</p>, <p>The gazes were now truly on me.</p>, <p>\"Many of you stand at the very peak of the Empire. Proud sons of heaven...\"</p>, <p>I kept my tone flat.</p>, <p>\"Everywhere you go, people will praise you. Call you an elite of the Empire.\"</p>, <p>This was simply because Leon suggested me to. He was the one who came up with the speech after all.</p>, <p>\"Someone that should be worshiped.\"</p>, <p>But that wasn't the reason why I followed the speech.</p>, <p>\"But...\"</p>, <p>The main reason why I followed it was because,</p>, <p>\"Remember.\"</p>, <p>I liked it.</p>, <p>\"I stand above you.\"</p>, <p>I almost laughed after saying that line. Taking in the expressions of all those in the hall, I almost regretted not having a phone.</p>, <p>It wasn't a pretty sight.</p>, <p>Amidst the glares of disgust, hatred, and scorn directed towards me, I chose to stand my ground next to the podium, taking in everything that was directed my way.</p>, <p>Leon's reasoning behind the speech was that he believed this was what the previous Julien would've said.</p>, <p>I didn't doubt it.</p>, <p>But that wasn't the reason why I went through with it. If I wanted to, I could've said something different.</p>, <p>But I didn't.</p>, <p>\"What sort of joke is this?\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, one of the cadets stood up from their seat and shouted,</p>, <p>\"Are you seriously supposed to be the Black Star? I refuse to believe someone like you can be our top ranker! I request a duel!\"</p>, <p>Ah, yes.</p>, <p>This was what I wanted.</p>, <p>A cliche scenario.</p>, <p>\"Me too!\"</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus. I request a duel...!\"</p>, <p>What came after the first was the second, and then the third...</p>, <p>\"Fight me!\"</p>, <p>The entire hall became heated with several cadets standing up and challenging me on the spot.</p>, <p>While some appeared to be influenced by a few instigators, a significant number seemed genuinely eager to fight me.</p>, <p>'Yeah, this is it.'</p>, <p>It was the effect that I desired to achieve.</p>, <p>My time was limited.</p>, <p>I needed to get stronger. And for that, I needed a target on my back.</p>, <p>Pressure.</p>, <p>A comfortable environment wouldn't shape me into a stronger individual. What I craved was pressure, and the best way to intensify the pressure on myself was to provoke every first-year in attendance.</p>, <p>'It was bound to happen anyways...'</p>, <p>I wasn't naive enough to think nobody would challenge me the moment I entered the institute.</p>, <p>It was bound to happen.</p>, <p>I only hurried that process.</p>, <p>'Only this way can I force myself to improve faster...'</p>, <p>I could already feel the weight of my actions on my shoulders. It weighed heavily on them, but it was necessary.</p>, <p>Growth can only be achieved through struggle.</p>, <p>And what better way to make myself struggle than this?</p>, <p>'That's right.'</p>, <p>This had to be done.</p>, <p>For the sake of my growth.</p>, <p>\"I'll do anything.\"</p>]\n",

Why does it seem like you're surprised?\"</p>, <p>\"I didn't think you'd go through with it.\"</p>, <p>\"...And why is that?\"</p>, <p>So he was expecting me to say something else...?</p>, <p>\"No...\"</p>, <p>He pursed his lips and shook his head.</p>, <p>\"It's nothing.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>What was up with this guy?</p>, <p>Closely looking at him, his expression seemed unusually stiff. As if he was holding himself back.</p>, <p>\"Are you okay?\"</p>, <p>He really didn't look so good.</p>, <p>I inched closer to get a better look, but...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>He took a step back.</p>, <p>\"Let's keep things cordial.\"</p>, <p>Cordial? What is this guy on about?</p>, <p>\"No, no...\"</p>, <p>I shook my head and moved closer. Something felt off... I couldn't quite explain it.</p>, <p>That's when I finally noticed it.</p>, <p>This fucker.</p>, <p>I pressed my hand against his shoulder to stop him from moving and tilted my head to get a better look at his face.

Long flowing purple hair and crystal blue eyes. An image overlapped with hers.</p>, <p>One that was filled with nothing but hatred toward myself.</p>, <p>\"...It's been a while.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn J.

Her tone was cold and lacked any form of praise. She was also not looking at me.</p>, <p>Her eyes...

I really did. Even when you changed, I waited. I thought you'd come back to how you normally were, but....\"</p>, <p>Stopping herself, she shook her head.</p>, <p>Softly, she mumbled in a voice that I could barely hear, 'It's not worth it. There's no point.'</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I thought she'd give up from that point, but yet again, her eyes fell on my hand.</p>, <p>And then toward Leon.</p>, <p>\"Why do you let him treat you like this?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Leon stood quietly. He seemed to be chewing on his words, seemingly thinking about how to respond.</p>, <p>She spoke before he could,</p>, <p>\"I know you're loyal to the family, but why let yourself be treated like this? You're better than thi—\"</p>, <p>\"It's none of that.\"</p>, <p>Leon cut her off mid-sentence.</p>, <p>Her expression froze.</p>, <p>\"He wasn't doing anything to me.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>She stepped back and made an incredulous look. She seemed even more disappointed.</p>, <p>\"...Do you take me for some sort of fool? I saw all of it.\"</p>, <p>Saw all of it?</p>, <p>I couldn't help but speak out.</p>, <p>\"What did you see?\"</p>, <p>I struggled to understand what she was trying to say.</p>, <p>\"Seriously...?\"</p>, <p>Her expression seemed scornful.</p>, <p>\"It was obvious what you were trying to do. How many times do you think I've seen the same scene in the past? You were using him as your test dummy, as usual.\"</p>, <p>Test dummy?</p>, <p>I looked at Leon who looked back at me. His expression didn't say much, but his subtle nod told me all that I needed to know.</p>, <p>Ah.</p>, <p>So that's how it is.</p>, <p>I was just about to speak, when all of a sudden, Leon spoke.</p>, <p>\".....It isn't the case this time.\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"You're still defending him? Even after-\"</p>, <p>\"He told me a joke.\"</p>, <p>Uh?</p>, <p>Both me and Evelyn were taken aback.</p>, <p>A joke?</p>, <p>I looked at Leon who looked back at me. What is this guy on about?</p>, <p>Though his expression seemed indifferent, his eyes seemed to say, 'Roll with it.'</p>, <p>Roll with it...?</p>, <p>\"...A joke?\"</p>, <p>I felt Evelyn's gaze on me. She was staring at me with a face of utter disappointment.</p>, <p>I didn't understand why she was looking at me like that, but I felt like I needed to play along.</p>, <p>So,</p>, <p>\"Yeah, I did.\"</p>, <p>I went along with it.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>All it brought was silence from her. One that she broke shortly after.</p>, <p>\".....Do I look that easy to you?\"</p>, <p>I felt my skin crawl all of a sudden. If before she looked at me in disappointment, she was now looking at me with scorn.</p>, <p>\"I'm seriously asking. Do you take me for a joke?\"</p>, <p>\".....No.\"</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>Her expression was overcome with distraught.</p>, <p>I don't know why, but I felt like I needed to do something.</p>, <p>So I did,</p>, <p>\"Why don't they play poker in the jungle?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn seemed to have been about to say something when her mouth closed.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I used to chance to say,</p>, <p>\"Too many cheetahs.\"</p>, <p>Regret came quickly.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>My face burned, but I kept it from changing. On the outside, it was as if I had said something trivial.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>Evelyn didn't seem to think of it the same way. After a brief moment of silence, she managed to force a weak smile.</p>, <p>\".....I guess you truly do think of me as a joke.\"</p>, <p>Turning to look at Leon, she bowed her head. Then, without looking back she left.</p>, <p>Her back seemed rather frail when I looked at it.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>At first, they were slow.</p>, <p>Tak, tak.</p>, <p>The sound of her steps as her heels tapped against the marble floor.</p>, <p>Tak, tak, tak.</p>, <p>But they soon hurried.</p>, <p>Her head was lowered the entire time. She could see her expression through the polished floor of the campus hall.</p>, <p>\"Hah...\"</p>, <p>The burning in her chest didn't seem to ease no matter how long she walked. Her vision blurred and her lips stung.</p>, <p>\"B-bastard.\"</p>, <p>Her feet eventually came to a stop.</p>, <p>A person stood in front of her.</p>, <p>\"....Are you okay?\"</p>, <p>It was her knight, Natasha. Standing tall, her platinum hair and crystal eyes made her stand out from the rest. Nobles had a unique perk when joining the institute. They were allowed to bring a personal attendant.</p>, <p>In Evelyn's case, she was able to bring Natasha with her. It was a precaution the noble houses took considering the political importance each child held within their houses.</p>, <p>The Verlice family was one of the five Viscount families within the Empire. They naturally were able to provide her with a powerful knight as her escort.</p>, <p>\"Was it him?\"</p>, <p>And as her knight, she was naturally aware of her circumstances.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's silence told many things.</p>, <p>Natasha's grip on her sword tightened.</p>, <p>\"So it was...\"</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>A name tingled the tip of her tongue.</p>, <p>His relationship with Evelyn was hard to describe. At one point, the two were close. Almost inseparable.</p>, <p>But things changed after a certain point.</p>, <p>His personality changed, and his lust for power started to display. He changed, and his spiral started to affect Evelyn who could do nothing but watch.</p>, <p>It eventually ended with her cutting ties with him.</p>, <p>That was five years ago.</p>, <p>\"....You know, I thought he could've changed.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn let out a strained laugh.</p>, <p>\"I was naive, wasn't I...? In the end, it's always like this...

Julien of the Evenus Barony. Maybe he could smoke in his room?</p>, <p>It was a thought that entertained her for a bit.</p>, <p>At first glance, he seemed quite arrogant.</p>, <p>Enough to infuriate practically every first-year cadet.</p>, <p>But unlike the others, she wasn't particularly interested in such meaningless squabbles.</p>, <p>\"Pfttt.\"</p>, <p>Rather, she found him to be somewhat funny.</p>, <p>\"Fucking jokes.\"</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>The plume of smoke drifted in the air as she took another drag of the cigarette.</p>, <p>Kiera, who was enjoying herself at the steps of the building, suddenly raised her head, catching a glimpse of an approaching figure.</p>, <p>She was quick to flick the cigarette away.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>There was a certain aura about the approaching figure that attracted the gazes of all those around. Her graceful movements exuded a sense of authority, flowing with sophistication and ease, concealing any hint of her flaws.</p>, <p>It was a figure she knew all too well. How could she not know her...?</p>, <p>A woman of the Megrail family.</p>, <p>The Princess of the Empire.</p>, <p>Aoife Kell Megrail.</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>Though she was in a class of her own, Kiera couldn't help but click her tongue. Her foot dragged over to where the cigarette was and she stepped on it.</p>, <p>Twisting her foot slightly.</p>, <p>Kiera looked down on her. As a noble of high lineage, she was well acquainted with Aoife. They had met many times in past events.</p>, <p>She shone brightly wherever she went. Was always the spotlight.</p>, <p>That didn't bother Kiera much.</p>, <p>...Not until the day of her coming to age ceremony and her talent was made known to Aoife and the royal family.</p>, <p>As a result?</p>, <p>She, who was supposed to have started her training at age fourteen, was forced to train at seventeen. The same age as low-end nobles.</p>, <p>For what reason...?</p>, <p>'This bitch.'</p>, <p>\"Cadet.\"</p>, <p>Aoife stopped in front of her. Her yellow eyes slowly sank down to meet Kiera's gaze. Her expression didn't say much.</p>, <p>It was hard to read.</p>, <p>There was nothing unusual about this. She had always been like this. A blank piece of paper with hardly any thoughts.</p>, <p>And the thought irritated Kiera even more.</p>, <p>\"....What.\"</p>, <p>\"Can you move?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Kiera blinked and looked around. Then she realized. She was blocking the entrance.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'Is that all....?'</p>, <p>No form of acknowledgment. A name? Just... Cadet? They had met several times in the past. Even made brief conversation. It was complete disregard.</p>, <p>\"Cadet?\"</p>, <p>\"Hehe.\"</p>, <p>Kiera pursed her lips and smiled. It was a bright smile. One of the brightest she had ever displayed.</p>, <p>And what followed after her smile was...</p>, <p>\"Fuck you.\"</p>, <p>A middle finger.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>Sweat intermixed with my blood.</p>, <p>My eyes stung.</p>, <p>And my vision was blurred.</p>, <p>A day had passed. It was now early in the morning.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>Tzz----</p>, <p>\"....Failed.\"</p>, <p>I was met with another failure.</p>, <p>The result of my efforts was the connection of eight runes. A result that was far beneath my desired goal.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I thought about continuing again, when...</p>, <p>To Tok--!</p>, <p>The door knocked.</p>, <p>\"Young master.\"</p>, <p>And a familiar voice sounded.</p>, <p>\"...So it's time.\"</p>, <p>There could only be one reason for him to call me. The first day of the Academy was about to start.</p>, <p>\"I'm comin-Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>My legs gave out when I tried to stand up.</p>, <p>Fortunately, I was able to stop myself from falling face flat on the floor by grasping the side of the sofa.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My breaths were heavy and my hands were unusually pale.</p>, <p>It was obvious that my body was in poor condition.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking another breath I forced myself into the shower. I stumbled several times in the process before finally making it to the valve where I turned on the cold water.</p>, <p>Shaaa--!</p>, <p>My skin prickled at the cold.</p>, <p>But at the same time, my mind regained some clarity.</p>, <p>Supporting myself with both hands on the wall, I let the water trickle down my back.</p>, <p>One might think I'd be distressed with the results of my training.</p>, <p>In some ways I was.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Almost.\"</p>, <p>At the same time, I was also thrilled.</p>, <p>It wasn't fruitless.</p>, <p>There was definitely a progression.</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>I laughed out in exasperation.</p>, <p>It was going to take time, but I knew I could do it.</p>, <p>I was that desperate.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The campus was large. It took me about five minutes to get to the main building from the dorms.</p>, <p>[Dorset Hall]</p>, <p>That was where we were supposed to be.</p>, <p>It was one of the seven halls of the institute and where first-year cadets attended their lessons.</p>, <p>\".....What class are we in?\"</p>, <p>The Hall was large.</p>, <p>It was one big building with a pathway flanked by vibrant flowers and trees that guided toward the entrance, where a row of statues stood in solemn formation.</p>, <p>It overflowed with students.</p>, <p>Most troublesome were the gazes they looked at me with. Some avoided me, while others seemed to be openly hostile.</p>, <p>I was fine with that.</p>, <p>It came as a result of my actions on the first day.</p>, <p>\"Our class should be there.\"</p>, <p>Leon pointed towards a certain door. At first glance, it didn't seem all that impressive.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Why is there nobody going there?\"</p>, <p>Unlike the other classrooms, which were open and filled with cadets passing through, this one seemed rather isolated. As if people were avoiding it.</p>, <p>\"....Did you not read the manual?\"</p>, <p>\"Manual...? Ah.\"</p>, <p>I took a small leaflet from my pocket. I remember receiving it yesterday, but because my focus had been on my training, I forgot all about it.</p>, <p>\"This?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>, <p>I scanned through the contents.</p>, <p>In short.</p>, <p>\"We're late.\"</p>, <p>\".....That's right.\"</p>, <p>\"And you didn't tell me about it?\"</p>, <p>\"I thought you were aware.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>There were times when I just really wanted to strangle this guy.</p>, <p>If not for the fact that he was helping me and that he was stronger, I'd already be at it.</p>, <p>That said,</p>, <p>'I wonder what his end goal is...'</p>, <p>I was still not sure why he was helping me. He said something about it benefiting him.</p>, <p>How so?</p>, <p>'As expected, I still can't trust him.'</p>, <p> The same was true for him to me.</p>, <p>In a way, we weren't that much different.</p>, <p>Staring at the door to the classroom, I sighed.</p>, <p>I felt strangely nervous. It wasn't so much because I was scared of people challenging me. I was fine with that. What I was nervous about was my abilities.</p>, <p>They were not up to par at that moment.</p>, <p>I was probably the weakest cadet present.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>After secretly collecting my breath, I slowly and carefully approached the door.</p>, <p>Creaaak--</p>, <p>The interior was sleek; long wooden desks lined up the sides, cascading up. They were all filled to the brim, with barely any empty spots.</p>, <p>Immediately, all eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>They were burdensome. But the most burdensome of them all was the one that belonged to the woman in front of me.</p>, <p>Most likely, our instructor.</p>, <p>\"Cadets.\"</p>, <p>Her crystal blue eyes shifted between Leon and me. She had short brown hair and seemed to be in her mid-forties.</p>, <p>Alternating her gaze between the two of us she finally opened her mouth to say,</p>, <p>\"....You're late.\"</p>, <p>I was already aware.</p>, <p>Things would've been easier if I just apologized, but I recalled Leon's description of the previous Julien and answered flatly,</p>, <p>\"That seems to be the case.\"</p>, <p>\"Seems to be the case...?\"</p>, <p>My answer left her exasperated as she made a face. I felt a little sorry for her, but I didn't show it on the outside and kept my face stoic.</p>, <p>She opened her mouth but closed it right after.</p>, <p>\"Just go. Take a seat.\"</p>, <p>\".....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>I did just that.</p>, <p>Finding the nearest seat I could find, I sat down and took a breath.</p>, <p>That was easier than I expected.</p>, <p>She was probably a lenient teacher. Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"You're late! Get out of my class!\"</p>, <p>Staring at the student who had just entered the class and got kicked out, I opened my mouth to say something when I realized I couldn't say anything.</p>, <p>Why....?</p>, <p>I looked to my left, where Leon sat. He looked at me and then shrugged.</p>, <p>\"Probably our looks.\"</p>, <p>Oh.</p>, <p>The lecture resumed.</p>, <p>\"Continuing from where I was... As you all are currently aware, magic is subdivided into three different categories. [Mind], [Elemental], and [Body].\"</p>, <p>The classroom fell into silence.</p>, <p>The instructor's voice smoothly echoed throughout the classroom.</p>, <p>\"Each category is further divided into subcategories. Take the [Mind] classification as an example. With the [Emotive], [Telekinesis], [Spirit], and [Telepathy] it contains a total of four sub-categories. Or some like to say, 'paths'.\"</p>, <p>I strained my ears to listen closely to the lecture. All information was vital. I needed to pay close attention to all that was being said.</p>, <p>\"....As is known, everyone can practice magic. If you can manipulate mana, you have the qualifications to become a magician or knight. That of course, isn't a problem for all of you present.\"</p>, <p>She seemed to eye certain students; her gaze eventually falling on me.</p>, <p>\"Talent is merely a factor that indicates the rate of your improvement. It does not limit you in the practice of other paths.\"</p>, <p>I took note of this piece of information in my mind.</p>, <p>My talents currently lie in the [Curse] and [Emotive] subcategories.</p>, <p>If it was possible for me to practice things outside of those two categories, then it was worth considering for the future.</p>, <p>\"Now, time for a question.\"</p>, <p>The lecturer looked around the classroom. I felt her gaze linger in my direction for a brief moment.</p>, <p>What sort of...?</p>, <p>She smiled.</p>, <p>\"Of all the categories, which do you deem to be the weakest?\"</p>, <p>The weakest?</p>, <p>Murmurs filled the classroom as the students discussed among themselves.</p>, <p>Eventually, one of the cadets raised their hands. He stood out immediately with his tall height, blonde hair, and blue eyes.</p>, <p>The fact that his appearance garnered the attention of many of the people present told me all that I needed to know about him.</p>, <p>He was strong.</p>, <p>Probably amongst the higher-ranked cadets.</p>, <p>\"Yes? Cadet Anders.\"</p>, <p>Oh?</p>, <p>I suddenly felt his gaze.</p>, <p>As his mouth parted open, he answered slowly. As if he wanted me to hear his answer.</p>, <p>\"....Emotive.\"</p>, <p>A clear provocation.</p>, <p>Multiple eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>\"Emotive?\"</p>, <p>The instructor's gaze fell on me for a moment. She seemed to have been influenced by the others in the class.</p>, <p>\"What makes you think that's the case?\"</p>, <p>\"It's the longest category to learn. Not only that, but you must be able to touch your opponent to influence their emotions. If they can't touch you, they're useless.\"</p>, <p>\"That's not the case.\"</p>, <p>With a shake of her head, the instructor corrected,</p>, <p>\"That's merely on the basis that they are on the first level of mastery. At a higher stage, they can influence someone with mere words. Further down the path, and they can read emotions.\"</p>, <p>I listened to her words carefully.</p>, <p>The [Emotive] sub-category was still an enigma to me. Unlike with my [Curse] sub-category, I couldn't practice it through repetition training.</p>, <p>The only way for me to further the [Emotive] path was through the understanding of emotions. The more I understood, the more I improved.</p>, <p>But that was easier said than done.</p>, <p>'Now that I think about it... She mentioned something about first-level mastery.'</p>, <p>I was reminded of the notifications I received almost daily.</p>, <p>The only regarding [Fear] and Exp.</p>, <p>'....So if I improve it, I'll be able to influence people with words?'</p>, <p>The thought excited me for some reason.</p>, <p>Was there more to it?</p>, <p>The Cadet continued,</p>, <p>\"That is indeed true, but it's also true that it's not easy to achieve. It may take a lot of years to get to a level where one can influence another's emotions. To be able to influence them through words?\"</p>, <p>He scoffed.</p>, <p>\"...You will need to be as old as my father to be able to get there.\"</p>, <p>\"That's not necessarily true.\"</p>, <p>The instructor shook her head.</p>, <p>\"There are many cases where people achieve such a state at a young age. Keep in mind, that there are states above that. Being able to influence someone through words is still considered entry level.\"</p>, <p>Entry level...?</p>, <p>Influencing with words was just entry-level?</p>, <p>I thought back to my powers. Ever since the examination, I had hardly touched the other field.</p>, <p>It wasn't because I didn't like it.</p>, <p>That was the furthest thing from the truth.</p>, <p>The reality was that I was unsure whether I was capable of handling it. The after-effect from last time left a scar in my mind.</p>, <p>Like a mental block, it made me avoid it.</p>, <p>I was just not ready.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'You're telling me I merely scratched the surface of what's possible?'</p>, <p>\"Cadet Julien.\"</p>, <p>Feeling the instructor's gaze, I turned to face her.</p>, <p>\"....As an Emotive Mage yourself, what do you think about Cadet Anders's answer?\"</p>, <p>What did I think about it?</p>, <p>He's right.</p>, <p>All his words made sense. From what I experienced, he was right in absolutely every way.</p>, <p>The [Emotive] field was a path that would probably take someone ages to master.</p>, <p>It encompassed all the experiences of one's life and molded them in the form of emotions. Unless someone constantly experiences all those emotions, they won't be able to improve.</p>, <p>In that regard, it was the weakest of all the other paths.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I turned my wrist slightly.</p>, <p>My eyes fell on the clover tattoo.</p>, <p>Was that the same for me?</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The classroom fell silent.</p>, <p>They all were seemingly awaiting my answer. 'What's he going to say?', 'How will he answer with?'</p>, <p>Their faces all said the same thing.</p>, <p>And I looked back to face the cadet.</p>, <p>Anders was it?</p>, <p>I found the corner of my lips lifting slightly.</p>, <p>\"....It's bullshit.\"</p>, <p>An answer flowed out of my mouth.</p>, <p>\"Weakest? There's no such thing.\"</p>, <p>I wasn't just bullshitting at the moment.</p>, <p>These were my true thoughts.</p>, <p>\"There's only a weak person. No weak path.\"</p>, <p>Just because the Emotive field was the hardest to progress in didn't mean it was the weakest class.</p>, <p>From the start, the question was wrong.</p>, <p>\"You say that it takes a lot of time for an Emotive mage to be strong. On what basis do you say that?\"</p>, <p>\"What basis?\"</p>, <p>The Cadet looked at me as if I were stupid.</p>, <p>\"It's common sense. Take a look at all the strongest mages in the world. Our Empire has seven Monarchs. How many of them are from the Emotive field? None!\"</p>, <p>He pointed his finger at me.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, he started talking about something different.</p>, <p>Most probably what he wanted to say from the start.</p>, <p>\".....Do you think none of us see it? Your mana flow is weak. You don't even seem to be capable of properly controlling your mana. On good god, I don't know why you're ranked first.\"</p>, <p>His words seemed to echo the thoughts of many of the people present in the classroom, with many of them nodding along.</p>, <p>I took in the sight.</p>, <p>\"My best guess is because of your achievements in the Emotive field. Even then, I doubt you'll be able to do anything to me.\"</p>, <p>When he finally said what he wanted to say, with a look of scorn, he added,</p>, <p>\"Simply put, you're not fit for the role. You're weak.\"</p>, <p>Once again, the room fell into silence.</p>, <p>All eyes were trained on me.</p>, <p>\"Haaa....\"</p>, <p>With all attention on me, I leaned my head back and closed my eyes.</p>, <p>'....So they noticed.'</p>, <p>It wasn't as though I didn't expect it.</p>, <p>Everyone must've noticed it during the first day. The fact that I was weak. That I wasn't on the same level as them.</p>, <p>I understood this even more clearly than they did.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I provoked everyone.</p>, <p>Trained to the point of insanity.</p>, <p>His words made sense, and there was nothing wrong with them.</p>, <p>Still,</p>, <p>\"You're wrong.\"</p>, <p>My eyes were still closed, so I couldn't see.</p>, <p>All that I saw was darkness.</p>, <p>In that darkness, I could feel my hand move towards my forearm. Where the four-leaved clover rested.</p>, <p>I was a little hesitant at first, but then, I was reminded of my goal.</p>, <p>That was when my mind became firm.</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>To achieve my goal, I need to make full use of all the advantages I have.</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>My finger pressed down on my forearm.</p>, <p>'...Nobody but me can be the Black Star.'</p>]\n",

Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My vision blurred, and every single breath was accompanied by even more pain.</p>, <p>Noel's hand shook.</p>, <p>\"...Since you can run, I can too, right?\"</p>, <p>He looked at me.</p>, <p>This time, it really felt like he could see me.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Tears, uninvited, welled up, and my mouth trembled. What was this? How could speaking hurt so much...?</p>, <p>\"You won't mind if I join you, right?\"</p>, <p>\"....No, no.\"</p>, <p>My voice came out weak.</p>, <p>I found that I could no longer shout. The energy drained from my body. This sense of helplessness...</p>, <p>It slowly carved itself into my mind.</p>, <p>So did the pain.</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>Noel smiled. In a way, his smile seemed liberating. But all I could feel was helplessness. I could feel myself breaking.</p>, <p>The colors started to drain from the world.</p>, <p>I could see the younger version of him, standing before me, asking me to buy him ice cream. It was just a couple of months after our parent's death.</p>, <p>It was just the two of us back then.</p>, <p>He had only been ten back then. I remember that day clearly because... That was the day he regained his smile.</p>, <p>I worked hard to keep it that way.</p>, <p>To make it so that he wouldn't stop smiling.</p>, <p>So...</p>, <p>Staring at the sight before me, I felt myself lose my breath.</p>, <p>His smile. The one I promised to keep.</p>, <p>It was gone.</p>, <p>I took it away from him.</p>, <p>\"It... hurts.\"</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>I flinched. My breath seemed to be caught in my throat as the gun fell from Noel's hand. His eyes, which appeared to be devoid of any light, lowered.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>And tears continuously poured down from them.</p>, <p>Biting his lips, he weakly leaned back.</p>, <p>\"I... I'm scared.\"</p>, <p>He covered his face with both hands.</p>, <p>\"I don't want to die.\"</p>, <p>His shoulders trembled.</p>, <p>\"...But I don't want to live.\"</p>, <p>The world seemed to grow faint.</p>, <p>\"W-what do I do...?\"</p>, <p>Just before it all faded, his head turned to face my direction once more.</p>, <p>\"....Tell me, brother. What do I do?\"</p>, <p>That was the last time I heard his voice.</p>, <p>Brightness engulfed my vision and I found myself in a familiar place.</p>, <p>All eyes were fixed on me.</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>But all I could feel was pain.</p>, <p>My chest felt tight and heavy.</p>, <p>Each breath felt heavier than the last.</p>, <p>And my vision was blurry.</p>, <p>It was at that point that I closed my eyes and saw a notification.</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 2. [Sadness] EXP + 15%</p>, <p>'Level 2...?'</p>, <p>At first, I was surprised, but then I understood.</p>, <p>Unlike fear, I was familiar with sadness. It was all I ever knew in my previous life. It was no wonder my understanding of it was greater than fear or any other emotion.</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, I opened my eyes.</p>, <p>\"...When was the last time that you cried?\"</p>, <p>Words flowed out of my mouth all of a sudden. They came out smoother than I thought.</p>, <p>They were directed towards one person.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? What are—Huh? Eh... Ah...\"</p>, <p>He stopped mid-sentence.</p>, <p>A strange silence filled my surroundings.</p>, <p>One that was broken by me as I stood up from my seat. Under the eyes of all present, I walked up the aisles before stopping in front of him.</p>, <p>His focus wasn't on me.</p>, <p>\"T-this... Wha-t is this...?\"</p>, <p>Flustered, he touched his cheeks.</p>, <p>They were stained with tears.</p>, <p>Gripping his shirt, he looked up at me.</p>, <p>\"W-what's going on? What did you do?\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer.</p>, <p>Instead, I asked,</p>, <p>\"Did I touch you?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah... H-ah.\"</p>, <p>The tears streamed with even more force as his face paled.</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth and raised my head. Recollections of the scene I witnessed replayed in my mind, threatening to force tears out of my eyes.</p>, <p>But I held them in.</p>, <p>I let the pain center towards my chest, where it had all accumulated.</p>, <p>Instead, I directed my attention towards Anders.</p>, <p>I opened my arms.</p>, <p>\"....You say I'm weak.\"</p>, <p>Unfitting of my rank.</p>, <p>\"Here's your chance. Hit me. \"</p>, <p>\"Uekh... I...\"</p>, <p>With his hand on his chest, he only looked at me.</p>, <p>I looked back at him.</p>, <p>\"So you can't...?\"</p>, <p>I reached my hand forward to grasp his shoulder. He flinched at the touch but wasn't able to free himself from it.</p>, <p>\"Tell me.\"</p>, <p>He seemed to be in too much pain to answer.</p>, <p>I could relate.</p>, <p>My body was being eaten from the inside. The pain was unbearable, and every second I stood felt like torture.</p>, <p>But I still held myself.</p>, <p>I couldn't show weakness.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>I then recalled the words he threw at me before this; 'Even then, I doubt you'll be able to do anything to me.'</p>, <p>That was when I asked,</p>, <p>\"....Am I doing something now?\"</p>, <p>He didn't answer.</p>, <p>Squeezing his shoulder, I murmured,</p>, <p>\"I thought so.\"</p>]\n",

Ignoring them, she lowered her head to stare at her hand.</p>, <p>It was trembling.</p>, <p>Slightly.</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>Aoife's only question was 'Why'.</p>, <p>But at heart, she knew the reason for this.</p>, <p>She shut her eyes, allowing her mind to delve deep as she rewound the events that had unfolded earlier.</p>, <p>Anders Maddison.</p>, <p>...He was one of the cadets to look out for. Ranked within the top hundreds, he was a very talented individual, and someone Aoife kept in mind.</p>, <p>He was a talented person she thought of recruiting for her faction.</p>, <p>She was especially pleased by his boldness.</p>, <p>\"Simply put, you're not fit for the role. You're weak.\"</p>, <p>His bold words back then echoed the thoughts of everyone present.</p>, <p>The weakest Black Star.</p>, <p>That was who Julien Dacre Evenus was.</p>, <p>'Weak.'</p>, <p>He was truly weak.</p>, <p>To the point where one might wonder how he had managed to get himself into the position. It was a thought that consumed Aoife's mind over the past week.</p>, <p>How could someone as weak as him become the Black Star?</p>, <p>She could recall his expression back then. Under the barrage of Anders's words, he seemed calm. Unfazed, almost.</p>, <p>It was as if he truly didn't care.</p>, <p>But was that the case...?</p>, <p>Did he truly not care?</p>, <p>At the time, when she saw him close his eyes, Aoife thought, 'He's running away.' His actions again made her ask the question,</p>, <p>'Just what is so special about him...?'</p>, <p>His attitude was trash, his mana flow was weak, and he wasn't of high noble birth.</p>, <p>\".....Why?\"</p>, <p>She was confident that if the two of them were to fight one-on-one, she'd beat him with a simple flick of her finger.</p>, <p>He was that weak in her eyes.</p>, <p>The only one whom she truly deemed strong was not Julien, but his knight.</p>, <p>Leon Rowan Ellert.</p>, <p>He was ranked second, and unlike Julien, Aoife could see that he was strong. She couldn't see herself beating him easily. If she wanted to beat him, she'd have to pull out every card she had.</p>, <p>\"....When was the last time that you cried?\"</p>, <p>Even now, she could remember his voice. The tone, the smoothness, and the fluidity of it. It wasn't something she could forget.</p>, <p>Never.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? What are—Huh? Eh... Ah...\"</p>, <p>The way Ander's face changed at his words, and tears flowed out of his eyes...</p>, <p>She could also remember.</p>, <p>The change was so abrupt that hardly anyone was able to react. Aoife was one of the few who was able to understand what had happened.</p>, <p>By the time she did, however, Julien was already standing in front of him.</p>, <p>\"Did I touch you?\"</p>, <p>He didn't.</p>, <p>His every action seemed calculated. As if he were evoking a certain flow.</p>, <p>First he evoked sadness.</p>, <p>\"...When was the last time that you cried?\"</p>, <p>Then, he evoked anger.</p>, <p>\"Here's your chance.

It wasn't their strength. Far from it. They were weak. Even the weakest mage could kill them.</p>, <p>.....But that was only on the premise that they didn't fall for their words.</p>, <p>Through the exploitation of a single emotion, Emotive Mages could evoke and manipulate other emotions. Though different, they were all intertwined together. And the more emotions am Emotive Mage could manipulate, the stronger they were.</p>, <p>Emotions were a weakness.</p>, <p>It was something that Aoife understood all too well.</p>, <p>Aoife's fist slowly clenched.</p>, <p>\"He's weak.\"</p>, <p>That was undeniable.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\".....He's strong.\"</p>, <p>Weak but strong.</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>A new name crawled its way up in her mind.</p>, <p>It stood right alongside Delilah's.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A familiar feeling.</p>, <p>One that I had grown accustomed to.</p>, <p>My legs were weak.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Each breath felt tiring.</p>, <p>And the world felt empty.</p>, <p>Colorless.</p>, <p>It was just.... meaningless.

In fact, we've managed to regain some of our territories as of late. Which is why you need to memorize the monsters that are on the list.

She didn't seem to mind and approached him. Her every action attracted the gaze of those around her. She was that pretty.</p>, <p>Too bad she was crazy.</p>, <p>Bat shit crazy.</p>, <p>\"How about this...\"</p>, <p>She leaned her elbow on his shoulder. Learning her head closer, she scratched her chin and nodded. As if she had just made a big decision.</p>, <p>\"You give me all your money, and in exchange, I'll let you hold my hand. How about it?\"</p>, <p>\"....Eh?\"</p>, <p>\"Is that a no?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>She clicked her tongue and proceeded to her next target. It went on like this for a while before she left with a gloomy look.</p>, <p>I thought about leaving, but the scene was rather entertaining. I wanted to know if anyone was willing to pay all their money just to hold her hand.</p>, <p>That, and...</p>, <p>The fact that I dreaded the next class.</p>, <p>[Dimension Diving]</p>, <p>As the name suggested, it was a class designated to emulate the environment of the 'Mirror Dimension'. While it wasn't the real deal, and the monsters were fake, it didn't mean that it was impossible to get injured.</p>, <p>Quite frankly.</p>, <p>I didn't want to go.</p>, <p>My skills were not up to par.</p>, <p>The only thing I could do was stay behind and watch.</p>, <p>\"Please gear yourself and put on your suits. We'll be starting in the next half hour.\"</p>, <p>A loud voice reminded me of the impending doom. Sighing to myself, I turned to look at Leon who had remained quiet the entire time. Turning his head to look at me, he raised his fist as if to say, 'Cheer up' before packing up his staff and heading for the door.</p>, <p>\"Hey, wait. Why are you leaving?\"</p>, <p>\"...Yes?\"</p>, <p>Leon stopped to look at me.</p>, <p>\"Aren't you supposed to be my knight?\"</p>, <p>Wasn't his entire job to protect me?</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>He nodded.</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>\"So...\"</p>, <p>\"...Are you going to file a complaint?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...\"</p>, <p>He nodded his head and excused himself.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I held my hand over my forehead.</p>, <p>Fuck.</p>, <p>I really didn't want to go.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was as if the air itself had cracked. Fragments, like that of a fractured mirror, lingered suspended in midair.</p>, <p>A small crowd formed outside of the shattered space. There were over several hundred students, all of them huddled together in their cliques.</p>, <p>The same couldn't be said for me.</p>, <p>Be it because they were avoiding me, or just didn't like me, nobody appeared anywhere around me.</p>, <p>.....I was the only one who was alone.</p>, <p>\"Mirror Dimension...\"</p>, <p>Not that I minded since my attention was on the cracked space in front of me.</p>, <p>'Yeah, I really don't want to go.'</p>, <p>Everything about it felt ominous.</p>, <p>Still, it wasn't like I had a choice. Whether I liked it or not, I had to go. Perhaps I'll be able to find answers here...</p>, <p>While I was in the midst of my thoughts, the instructor, Amir Wallow, showed up.</p>, <p>The surroundings went quiet.</p>, <p>\"Since everyone is gathered here, I'll make things short. We will now be diving in groups of five. I'll announce the list shortly.\"</p>, <p>The noise that had previously taken hold of the space increased as the cadets grew restless.</p>, <p>'So we're doing this in teams.'</p>, <p>\"It'll be random so the balance won't be right. However, that shouldn't matter since you aren't being graded for this. It's all about getting used to the environment for when you end up entering the more dangerous parts of the mirror dimension.\"</p>, <p>He then proceeded to give a rundown of the team's compositions. A team generally was composed of four to five members -- two damage-dealers, one long-range, one tank, and one support.</p>, <p>It generally alternated between one and two damage dealers per team.</p>, <p>In that sense, I was assigned the support role.</p>, <p>\"It is up to you to decide the team leader. Be it the strongest person, or who you feel will be able to lead better... It's up to you.\"</p>, <p>The teams were announced shortly after.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>Team Seven</p>, <p>: 1. Julien Evenus</p>, <p>: 2. Rosanne Brighton</p>, <p>: 3. Aoife Megrail</p>, <p>: 4. James Milner</p>, <p>: 5. Adan Whitelock</p>, <p>\"...Team Seven.\"</p>, <p>A lot of unfamiliar names appeared on the list. There were over a thousand first years, and it was hard for me to remember everyone's name.</p>, <p>However, there was one name that stood out from the rest.</p>, <p>Aoife Megrail.</p>, <p>The Megrail name stood out immediately. It was the name of the ruling house and one of the women that appeared in my vision.</p>, <p> Taking my eyes away from the board, I met her gaze. Her expression was hard to read, and briefly, I felt a certain coldness flash in her eyes. That went by really fast.</p>, <p>She was the first one to approach me. Her red hair gracefully swung in the air as her beautiful lips parted open.</p>, <p>\"We're on the same team.\"</p>, <p>\"...So it seems.\"</p>, <p>My tone came out rather stiff. I wasn't quite sure how to address her. With her being a princess, I had to be careful with my words.</p>, <p>That was until she spoke again.</p>, <p>\"You're weak.\"</p>, <p>She spoke in a manner that left no room for debate.</p>, <p>\"...That's why I will be the team leader.\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer and just stared at her. She looked back at me. Straight in the eyes. It was as if she was challenging me.</p>, <p>Wanted me to refuse her.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Do as you see fit.\"</p>, <p>All she did was do me a favor.</p>, <p>I didn't want to be the leader. I wasn't fit to be one as well.</p>, <p>As her composed expression began to reveal cracks under the impact of my actions, a smile tugged at my lips while I lowered my head.</p>, <p>\".....Team Leader.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>The air was dry.</p>, <p>The world appeared monochromatic, enveloped in shades of gray, with the sole exception of the vivid red and orange tones emanating from the sun in the sky.</p>, <p>I was running through a rocky field.</p>, <p>The other team members were running ahead of me. Unlike me, they didn't seem to be struggling.</p>, <p>My stamina was starting to run low.</p>, <p>Was this the difference between us...?</p>, <p>\"Let's stop here.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, we stopped just as I couldn't hold my composure. Halting, Aoife looked around before settling her gaze over a large rock.</p>, <p>\"Let's take a small break for now. We're almost near our destination.\"</p>, <p>Taking advantage of the situation, I sat on the rock to catch my breath. There were a total of five people in the group, and as I sat down, none of the members approached me and huddled over to Aoife.</p>, <p>'Can't blame them... She's a princess.'</p>, <p>Had I been in their position, I too would've been like them.</p>, <p>It was unfortunate that in the future, there was a chance she'd kill me. I needed to be careful around her.</p>, <p>An appropriate distance was required.</p>, <p>Still, from where I was, I could overhear their conversation.</p>, <p>\"Team Leader, where exactly are we going?\"</p>, <p>\"...Gathering point. We should be able to meet with the other members there.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, is that so.\"</p>, <p>A woman with gold locks sighed in relief. Rosanne Brighton. With a long staff in hand, she was the long-ranged fighter of the team.</p>, <p>An elemental user with dual attributes.</p>, <p>Fire, and water.</p>, <p>She looked around.</p>, <p>\"Things have been proceeding rather smoothly. We still haven't seen many monsters yet. Is it because this is one of the safer areas?\"</p>, <p>\"The point of this excursion is for us to familiarize ourselves with the environment. There shouldn't be that many monsters.\"</p>, <p>Standing at an imposing height of 2 meters, he towered over all of us. James Milner, the team's tanker, replied.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>Chewing on a jerky, Aoife glanced around.</p>, <p>\".....Still, keep your guard up. Always stay alert. Don't let your guard down.\"</p>, <p>\"Got it.\"</p>, <p>Nodding, Aoife finished the jerky and patted her hands.</p>, <p>\"Let's go.\"</p>, <p>We were back on the move.</p>, <p>The terrain shifted, and trees emerged in my field of vision, their leafless branches stretching out and gradually surrounding us as we advanced.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>Our group was engulfed in silence, disrupted only by the steady rhythm of our footsteps resonating against the uneven ground blanketed with a layer of damp, decomposing leaves.</p>, <p>Gradually, the light dimmed, and I sensed myself losing my sight. Wisps of fog clung to the gnarled trunks of the trees around us, making it hard for me to see.</p>, <p>\"....Continue.\"</p>, <p>A sense of dread assaulted my mind as we marched forward.</p>, <p>From eyesight to hearing... We were gradually losing sight of all our senses.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My breath started to feel heavy.</p>, <p>...Was it because I was growing tired?</p>, <p>A thought that accompanied my mind as I continued forward.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>My head throbbed all of a sudden.</p>, <p>The pain wasn't intense. It came as fast as it left. By the time I regained my senses, the light started to return.</p>, <p>'What was that...?'</p>, <p>Checking myself, I felt nothing strange with my body. Staring at my hands, I frowned but continued forward.</p>, <p>My mind eventually relaxed after a couple of minutes.</p>, <p>\"....I'm probably tired.\"</p>, <p>Just as I felt my chest grow lighter.....</p>, <p>SHIIIING--!</p>, <p>Something streaked through the air, coming at me from a nearby tree. It was so fast that I had no time to react.</p>, <p>Before I even had the chance to gather my bearings, an intense pain flooded my chest.</p>, <p>Thump.</p>, <p>And I fell to my knees.</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>Blood spilled from my mouth as I felt my head grow light.</p>, <p>The world became a blur from there.</p>, <p>\"W-what...\"</p>, <p>I could hardly speak and the words refused to leave my mouth.</p>, <p>The pain was hard to describe.</p>, <p>It was intense, and my consciousness grew faint.</p>, <p>Clank--!</p>, <p>The last thing I managed to see before I lost consciousness was a small creature diving from the front, right toward Aoife who just barely managed to react.</p>, <p>\"Sh-it...\"</p>, <p>And then the world grew dark.</p>, <p>Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"Uahp...!\"</p>, <p>As if oxygen had been removed from my lungs, I took a deep breath. My consciousness returned and clarity returned.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>The familiar sound of my footsteps echoed through the ground, and as I looked ahead, familiar backs came into view.</p>, <p>'What just...'</p>, <p>The memory of the situation was still vivid in my mind. Although my vision was hindered, the path was familiar.</p>, <p>From the trees to our current location. It was all the same. Just in a couple of minutes, we should be coming out...</p>, <p>Indeed, as I thought, lights started to return. A familiar view.</p>, <p>Gradually, my feet started to slow down.</p>, <p>Noticing my situation, the others stopped as well. With a frown, Aoife looked at me.</p>, <p>\"Are you tired?\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer her.</p>, <p>Scanning my surroundings, everything appeared to be the same as before. So much that it felt eery.</p>, <p>\"...Julien?\"</p>, <p>The positions of the trees, the placement of the rocks, and the sensation of the air--every detail rushed vividly back to my memory.</p>, <p>It can't be, right...?</p>, <p>\"Hey...!\"</p>, <p>I snapped out of it when two large hands grasped my shoulders. A rough face inched close to mine.</p>, <p>\"Someone is talking to you, pay attention.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>That was when I realized everyone was looking at me. Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath before opening my eyes again.</p>, <p>\"Let go.\"</p>, <p>\"You.\"</p>, <p>Raising my hand, I was just about to grasp his shoulder when he let go and cursed.</p>, <p>\".....Arrogant bastard.\"</p>, <p>Ignoring him, I patted and adjusted my clothes. Feeling Aoife's intense gaze, I felt compelled to say something.</p>, <p>\"There's an ambush ahead.\"</p>, <p>Maybe.</p>, <p>I wasn't too sure.</p>, <p>\"An ambush...?\"</p>, <p>Making a dumbfounded look, James's mouth dropped.</p>, <p>\"Is that really the best excuse you cou--\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>Ignoring him, I took a step forward.</p>, <p>\"Hey, you...!\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>And then another. Carefully counting each step, I closed my eyes and replayed the memory in my mind. Gradually, I arrived near the exact spot where the memory ended.</p>, <p>I was just one step away.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>My feet stopped.</p>, <p>Just one step. As long as I took a step...</p>, <p>\"Are we seriously going to waste time waiting for him? He's just trying to save himself from the embarrassment. If--\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>I took that step.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>SHIIIING--!</p>, <p>Just as in the memory, the moment I took the step, the tree rustled and something fast streaked through the air. But unlike last time, I was prepared. Tilting my body ever so slightly, it passed right before me.</p>, <p>With a 'thud,' it came crashing toward the ground, revealing a glimpse of its features.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I didn't pay much attention to it's looks. Turning my attention toward my group, I nudged with my chin.</p>, <p>\"...Get rid of it.\"</p>]\n",

The vision grabbed my thoughts as it replayed in my mind.</p>, <p>Every detail, from the minutiae to the grand, was etched vividly in my memory.</p>, <p>With a thought, I could recall everything that had happened. From the pain to the very last moments when something dashed at the team leader.</p>, <p>The memories were vivid in my mind, and as my gaze settled on a specific tree, my hand instinctively reached out, extending a finger to point at it.</p>, <p>\"That one.\"</p>, <p>I was sure.</p>, <p>The memories told me so.</p>, <p>\".....Get rid of that one too.\"</p>, <p>Another one was hiding in that tree.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'How did he know...?'</p>, <p>Aoife looked at his back, her eyes falling on the creature on the ground.</p>, <p>'Rabbleflit'</p>, <p>An 'infant' ranked beast.

The tree shriveled up, compressing like a scrunched-up paper.</p>, <p>It all happened so fast that the creature was unable to react.</p>, <p>\"Hieek...!\"</p>, <p>After a deafening screech, what followed was the creature's shriveled-up body.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Aoife took a look at the creature before turning her head away.</p>, <p>'How ugly...'</p>, <p>Just like Julien, she was talented in two fields.</p>, <p>[Mind] and [Body].</p>, <p>Unlike Julien, who was proficient in the Emotive field under the Mind classification, she was more proficient in Telekinesis.</p>, <p>With a single thought, she could manipulate an inanimate object.</p>, <p>\"Yuck, it looks nasty.\"</p>, <p>A different figure drew near, leaning forward as her golden locks cascaded over her face while she grimaced.</p>, <p>\"They really do look different than the textbooks, don't they?

The paper in her hand wrinkled under her grasp.</p>, <p>\"To think you'd even try to target this place...\"</p>, <p>Finally, cracks appeared on her usually composed expression as her lips twisted up. A sneer marred her features.</p>, <p>\"How bold.\"</p>, <p>She spat out, trying her best to suppress the raging storm that was boiling in her chest.</p>, <p>Staring at the tattoo in the picture, her expression turned frosty.</p>, <p>\"How very bold...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Looks like all the teams have gathered.\"</p>, <p>There were no other hiccups on our journey to the designated spot.

I didn't want to completely rely on this ability.</p>, <p>Of course, that didn't mean I wasn't prepared to use it.</p>, <p>Every advantage was necessary.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'It's best if I tread lightly.'</p>, <p>Yeah.</p>, <p>So that I wouldn't lose sight of myself.</p>, <p>I had to tread lightly.</p>, <p>\"Hoo...\"</p>, <p>I floated on the water, with only my neck and hand breaking the surface.</p>, <p>Considering the after-effects of the first ability, the prospect of using the second one felt daunting.</p>, <p>My eyes continued to linger over the tattoo.</p>, <p>What was going to happen if I pressed on it...?</p>, <p>Was the side-effect going to be greater? If so, will I be fine by the end of it?</p>, <p> So many questions, and so few answers....</p>, <p>\"....Shall I try?\"</p>, <p>There was only one way to find out.</p>, <p>Although the idea seemed daunting, my mind was firm. Something was weighing heavily on my mind, and it was eating me up from the inside.</p>, <p>All I wanted was for it to stop.</p>, <p>And for that...</p>, <p>\"I'll do it.\"</p>, <p>Even if it meant more pain.</p>, <p>With such thoughts, I reached for the second leaf.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Silently I felt my finger touch my skin.</p>, <p>It pressed on the area where the second leaf lit up and I closed my eyes in preparation for what was to come.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\".....Nothing?\"</p>, <p>When I opened my eyes again, I noticed that everything was the same.</p>, <p>There was no change.</p>, <p>No, there was a change.</p>, <p>\"What's this?\"</p>, <p>The second leaf.</p>, <p>It had lost its light. It was now back to how it was before.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I silently stared at my hand for what felt like forever.</p>, <p>Eventually, my head sank into the water.</p>, <p>A part of me felt relieved, but another felt disappointed.</p>, <p>Submerging myself deeper into the water, I let myself relax.</p>, <p>In this strange silence.</p>, <p>I felt at peace.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The next day.</p>, <p>Classes were running as usual. First years weren't allowed to select their own courses. Therefore, as I glanced at the name of the lecture, I had to resist the urge to audibly groan.</p>, <p>\".....Language study.\"</p>, <p>As expected.</p>, <p>Even in this world, these types of lectures were unavoidable.</p>, <p>The language that was used in this empire was called 'Lumoraic'. A modern language that was only a few centuries old.</p>, <p>It was good that when I came to this world I was already able to speak, or else...</p>, <p>\"Let's not think about it.\"</p>, <p>I silently entered the classroom.</p>, <p>The classroom was rather large. With over a hundred students, it had to be spacious.</p>, <p>The moment I entered the classroom, several gazes fell on me. Their gazes still felt burdensome, but I was slowly starting to get used to them.</p>, <p>I looked around before eventually making my way toward where Leon was.</p>, <p>It was strange.</p>, <p>Before, he'd used to follow me everywhere. As if he was studying my every move.</p>, <p>However, now... He didn't seem to care as much.</p>, <p>Still, he did save me a seat.</p>, <p>So that's that.</p>, <p>I had just taken a seat when Leon glanced at me and frowned.</p>, <p>\".....You look quite tired.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yeah.\"</p>, <p>I hardly slept last night.</p>, <p>\"I'm still adjusting.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh. Take care of yourself.\"</p>, <p>\"...Yeah.\"</p>, <p>The conversation ended there. He was a man of little words, and so was I. Our conversations usually lasted for this long.</p>, <p>To an outsider, they probably sounded like an extremely stiff conversation. However, I liked it to be like this.</p>, <p>It was the perfect distance.</p>, <p>Not too close and not too far.</p>, <p>It was exactly 8 o'clock when the professor in charge came in.</p>, <p>\"Looks like the class is packed. It's nice to see so many students eager to learn a new language.\"</p>, <p>The professor was a middle-aged man adorned with a meticulously groomed mustache and gray hair. Clad in elegant attire, his demeanor exuded an unmistakable aura of grace.</p>, <p>It was obvious at a glance that he was a high-end noble.</p>, <p>\"As many of you know, the mirror dimensions hold many mysteries. From resources to ancient scripts... There are a lot of hidden treasures within the dimension.\"</p>, <p>There was a reason why the Empire had many supply stations constructed within the Dimension.</p>, <p>It wasn't just for the sake of stopping the expansion of the dimension. It was also for the sake of gathering resources. From the ruins of old civilizations to ores, and monsters... It held a lot of opportunity.</p>, <p>\"As one says. Knowledge is power. Within the ancient civilizations, there are many books detailing a lot of useful information regarding the expansion of the Mirror Dimension. By studying their language, we're empowering ourselves with the ability to understand their mistakes and technology.\"</p>, <p>The professor seemed enthusiastic about the lecture.</p>, <p>He went on to brag about the Empire's achievement in this field and how they were ahead of the other Empires.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I couldn't feel the same excitement he felt.</p>, <p>\"....Huam.\"</p>, <p>A light yawn escaped my mouth.</p>, <p>It was a quiet one.</p>, <p>To the extent that no one else seemed to notice.</p>, <p>But it perfectly reflected my state of mind.</p>, <p>I was tired, and the lecture was boring.</p>, <p>Having barely slept the previous night, coupled with how interesting the lecture was, I found myself succumbing to drowsiness.</p>, <p>I had to pinch myself several times to keep myself from falling asleep.</p>, <p>But there was a slight problem.</p>, <p>While I did try my best to hide my drowsiness, it wasn't enough.</p>, <p>--Cadet Julien, is my lecture boring you?</p>, <p>A shadow cast over the area I was in.</p>, <p>Looking up, the professor was standing a few meters away from me.</p>, <p>\"...?\"</p>, <p>I scratched the side of my head.</p>, <p>--Did you manage to sleep last night?</p>, <p>I thought about an appropriate answer but,</p>, <p>--No.</p>, <p>I shook my head and came clean.</p>, <p>--I wasn't able to sleep much last night.</p>, <p>The professor's expression stiffened all of a sudden.</p>, <p>A small commotion followed suit as multiple eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>The situation took me aback.</p>, <p>'What's going on...?'</p>, <p>And then, I heard a small voice behind me.</p>, <p>\".....Was it just me or did his pronunciation sound even better than the professor's?\"</p>, <p>Pronunciation...?</p>, <p>I thought back on the conversation I had with the professor.</p>, <p>All he did was ask whether his lecture was boring me.</p>, <p>What was so strange ab-</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>That's when I realized.</p>, <p>'This...'</p>, <p>We were both speaking English.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The language class ended after one hour.</p>, <p>Evelyn walked with her head lowered, accompanied by a young woman with short brown hair.</p>, <p>\"Ah~ My back hurts. I can't believe we had to go through that.\"</p>, <p>Theoretical classes always tended to be more boring than practical ones.</p>, <p>\"And the fact that we have to memorize the alphabet before the next class is even worse. Kill me already...!\"</p>, <p>As Josephine grumbled, she suddenly recalled something and tilted her head.</p>, <p>\"Evelyn, didn't you say you were acquainted with Julien?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts at the mention of Julien's name.</p>, <p>\"Did you say something?\"</p>, <p>\"Geez~ Pay attention when I'm talking.\"</p>, <p>Rubbing her forehead, Josephin repeated,</p>, <p>\"Didn't you say you were acquainted with Julien?\"</p>, <p>\"...Ah, yes.\"</p>, <p>Julien. An image of a man appeared in her mind.</p>, <p>It stuck there and refused to leave.</p>, <p>\"Was he always like that? I mean, not only is he the Black Star, but he also seems to be very proficient in English. Shee~\"</p>, <p>Josephine rubbed the sides of her arms.</p>, <p>\"Did you notice the professor's expression when he was talking to him? For a moment, I found myself questioning who the real expert was. Did you not feel the same way?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Evelyn remained silent at the question. She had been quietly biting her lips for a while now.</p>, <p>Josephine tilted her head in confusion.</p>, <p>Why is she so quiet?</p>, <p>She usually wasn't this quiet.</p>, <p>\"What's wrong? Did you not feel the same?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>But yet again Evelyn remained quiet.</p>, <p>Realizing that something was off, Josephine followed Evelyn's line of sight.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>That was when she saw a figure in the distance.</p>, <p>He stood erect, his presence distinct from the others, and his strides measured and steady. His presence alone gathered the stares of those around him.</p>, <p>Staring at him from the distance, Evelyn's eyes narrowed.</p>, <p>Julien. What happened in the five years she hadn't seen him?</p>, <p>Gradually, the distance between the two of them shrank.</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>With one more step, he appeared in front of her.</p>, <p>As he passed, their gazes met briefly.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She thought he'd continue forward, but...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>His feet came to a stop just as he passed. Evelyn felt her shoulders grow tense at the fact. Turning around to face him, her eyes met with his.</p>, <p>They were cold.</p>, <p>Detached of any feelings. If before she could feel the emotions in his gaze, now... all she could feel was emptiness.</p>, <p>Alienation.</p>, <p>His words soon broke her thoughts.</p>, <p>\"Your lips.\"</p>, <p>He pointed.</p>, <p>\".....They're bleeding.\"</p>]\n",

Even now, she has a hard time understanding how to feel.</p>, <p>Perhaps, this was for the best.</p>, <p>Wiping her lips, she noticed Josephine looking at her with a dumbfounded expression.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"...So you really did know him?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Clasping her hands, Josephine brought her head closer to hers.

You need to keep in mind that--\"</p>, <p>\"I think it was my delivery.\"</p>, <p>Yeah, it had to be that.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Leon's body stiffened on the spot.</p>, <p>'Ah, shit.'</p>, <p>I raised my head to look at him. He looked at me with widened eyes and an expression that seemed to say 'Has he lost it...?'</p>, <p>I felt a little offended by his gaze.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>Why was he looking at me like that...?</p>, <p>He opened his mouth but closed it shortly after. He then turned around to face the opposite direction.</p>, <p>\"What are you--\"</p>, <p>\"Kht.\"</p>, <p>Kht...?</p>, <p>I stopped whatever I was doing and leaned my head to get a better look at him.</p>, <p>Why is he...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>An idea suddenly struck my mind.</p>, <p>I took a good long minute to think before finally saying,</p>, <p>\"What do you call a fish with no eyes?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Leon's eyes widened. For a moment, I thought I saw 'fear' flash in his eyes as his body flinched.</p>, <p>I continued,</p>, <p>\"Fsh.\"</p>, <p>\"Uhk...!\"</p>, <p>His body flinched.</p>, <p>And I continued,</p>, <p>\"What did the farmer who lost his rake say?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"Where is my rake?\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>Without looking back, Leon moved forward. The entire time, his shoulders were trembling. Staring at him, I felt the need to continue and raised my voice.</p>, <p>\"What do you call a fly with no wings?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"A walk.\"</p>, <p>\"....Kehut!\"</p>, <p>Holding his mouth, Leon sprinted forward.</p>, <p>I chased after him.</p>, <p>\"What did the cow...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Krrr...</p>, <p>The form expanded, gradually unveiling its massive, decaying jaws and spiky back. A potent surge of mana swept the surroundings as the figure increased in size.</p>, <p>\"Keep it quiet. We're not too far off from the institute.\"</p>, <p>Delilah stood not far from the creature. Her gaze lingered over the creature who stared at her with deep apprehension.</p>, <p>It growled at her before speaking.</p>, <p>\"...You think you can stop us? Your struggles are futile. Our preparations are almost done.\"</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>Delilah's expression changed. With a laugh, she looked at the creature mockingly.</p>, <p>\"You bastards are always the same. How many of your 'attacks' and 'preparations' have we thwarted over the years? Have you yet to learn your lesson?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>The beast growled.</p>, <p>\"You don--\"</p>, <p>Delilah's voice, layered by two other similar ones, cut through the creature.</p>, <p>\"You can't hide it from me.\"</p>, <p>The creature shuddered.</p>, <p>\"Hide...?\"</p>, <p>\"Your fear. I can see it from miles away.\"</p>, <p>Crunch...</p>, <p>The beast unknowingly took a step back as its body shuddered. An unknown emotion welled up from deep within its body, threatening to consume him.</p>, <p>\"Y-you....!\"</p>, <p>A red glow enveloped the beast's eyes. It understood then that its emotions were being played with.</p>, <p>But it was already too late.</p>, <p>In the moment the beast stepped back, its defeat was already set in stone.</p>, <p>Delilah's expression returned to its usually indifferent one as she raised her hand.</p>, <p>\"Krrrrr--!\"</p>, <p>The beast screamed, but it was futile.</p>, <p>Within moments of her raising her hand, the space around the beast compressed, and the echoing sound of bones cracking filled the air.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>Just like that, a 'Terror' ranked beast had died.</p>, <p>Udududuk--!</p>, <p>But something strange happened the moment the beast died. Black foam escaped its lips and its figure shrank to reveal the silhouette of a figure.</p>, <p>...A human.</p>, <p>Crunch... Crunch...</p>, <p>Delilah halted a few meters away from the body, her eyes coldly tracing it. Eventually, she bent down and turned its arm over.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A four-leaved clover appeared in her vision.</p>, <p>\"....As expected.\"</p>, <p>She let go of the arm, and ambers floated in the sky as the body gradually disappeared from view.</p>, <p>Crackle...!</p>, <p>Her cold eyes remained fixed on the disappearing body.</p>, <p>Gradually, her mouth parted open to mutter,</p>, <p>\"Inverted Sky.\"</p>, <p>A figure appeared in her mind.</p>, <p>One that she wholeheartedly preached to be the Black Star.</p>, <p>A crack yet again formed on her expressionless face.</p>, <p>\"....I hope I'm wrong.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was Friday.</p>, <p>The last day of the week.</p>, <p>Just like that, the first week at the institute was almost over. Today marked the second week of my transmigration.</p>, <p>Time seemed to have flown by during those two weeks. I could still vividly recall everything that had happened on the first day as if it were yesterday.</p>, <p>Quite frankly, I was tired.</p>, <p>Both physically and mentally.</p>, <p>But... I was slowly starting to adjust to this world. Slowly but surely, I was getting there.</p>, <p>I just needed a little bit more time.</p>, <p>\"Here you go.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I glanced at the letter that sat on my desk, and I looked up. It was the last lesson of the day, and I was just about to pack up when he suddenly showed up out of nowhere.</p>, <p>\"....What is this?\"</p>, <p>\"An invitation.\"</p>, <p>Leon answered flatly. I thought about having him elaborate but chose otherwise and just opened the letter.</p>, <p>I was bound to find out anyway.</p>, <p>To : Julien of the Evenus Barony.</p>, <p>We extend our warmest greetings to your esteemed self and cordially invite you to join our exchange.</p>, <p>Your presence is certain to elevate the grandeur of the occasion, and we eagerly anticipate the pleasure of your company alongside fellow dignitaries and distinguished guests. The event promises an evening of refined conversation, exquisite cuisine, and cultural enrichment.\"</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>I skimmed through the contents of the letter.</p>, <p>\"So, in short... A party?\"</p>, <p>\"Sort of.\"</p>, <p>Sort of...?</p>, <p>\"...And I have to attend?\"</p>, <p>I rubbed my forehead.</p>, <p>I was already starting to feel a headache.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded and added,</p>, <p>\"Everyone does.\"</p>, <p>\"...Ah.\"</p>, <p>Fuck.</p>, <p>Leon looked around before lowering his tone.</p>, <p> \"It's best if you attend the ceremony. Create some connections. It will help you out in the long term.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Remaining quiet, I sorted through my thoughts.</p>, <p>Indeed, he had a point. Connections were certainly important in this society. Not only to establish myself better as 'Julien', but for the future when the time came for me to leave this place.</p>, <p>It would certainly make my life easier.</p>, <p>With such thoughts, I looked up at Leon and slid the letter over.</p>, <p>\".....Fine.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The Haven campus was large.</p>, <p>Spanning over a large land, it boasted seven main halls—Leoni Hall, Rondeo Hall, Dorset Hall, Birming Hall, Milnton Hall, Karlson Hall, and Rottingham Hall.</p>, <p>Each Hall had its own distinct function.</p>, <p>The Rondeo Hall was where the dorms were located. The Leoni Hall was where the auditorium was located, the Rottingham was where the professors were situated, and so on…</p>, <p>Each hall served a distinct function, simplifying navigation for newcomers to the academy.</p>, <p>Rottingham Hall.</p>, <p>Tak— Tak!</p>, <p>The hall echoed with the soft click of her heels.</p>, <p>Delilah walked forward without as much as a single change in her expression.</p>, <p>\"Good afternoon, Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>\"It's nice to see you Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>Along the way, she'd get greeted by the staff that passed her. Glancing at them, she'd return them a nod.</p>, <p>This proceeded until she arrived at her office.</p>, <p>Creaaaak...</p>, <p>As the door opened, her feet came to a pause.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Her brows twitched at the sight that greeted her. Scratching the side of her head, she nimbly walked past the rows of documents that were scattered all over the floor before reaching her desk, where she sat down.</p>, <p>Gradually, her gaze fell on several fresh documents that sat by her desk.</p>, <p>They said;</p>, <p>[Extra-curricular Activities First Year Cadet selection]</p>, <p>'Oh, there was that.'</p>, <p>It was her job to review their applications.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>Casually flipping through the pages, she stamped on several of the applicant's submissions.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak—</p>, <p>Her stamp raised and fell continuously.</p>, <p>Until...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>her eyes fell on a certain application. It was none other than Julien's.</p>, <p>\"Comedy club...?\"</p>, <p>It was a fitting choice after a little bit of thought.</p>, <p>It probably had to do with his powers.</p>, <p>The stamp hovered over the application when...</p>, <p>\"Maybe not.\"</p>, <p>She stopped herself.</p>, <p>Though her assumptions about him had yet to be proven, she still didn't feel reassured to leave him to his own devices.</p>, <p>Therefore.....</p>, <p>\"Hold.\"</p>, <p>She put the application on hold.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Tak. Tak—</p>, <p>For the next half hour, she sorted through the documents in front of her.</p>, <p>By the time she was done, her head throbbed. Reaching out for her drawer, wrappers scattered on the ground when she opened it. Not minding it, she inserted her hand in and dug through the mess before finally finding what she wanted—A chocolate bar.</p>, <p>The most peculiar part of the bar was the sticker that stuck on top of it.</p>, <p>It said, 'Property of Delilah'.</p>, <p>Yeah, because this was her bar.</p>, <p>She bit into the bar.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Only then did her expression relax, and so did her shoulders.</p>, <p>Finally, she redirected her attention to her desk, where a crystal device sat. It was glowing faintly. Shoving the chocolate into her mouth, she tapped on it.</p>, <p>A voice echoed across the room shortly after.</p>, <p>[...Delilah]</p>, <p>It was deep and filled with authority.</p>, <p>Tossing the wrapper, Delilah replied flatly,</p>, <p>\"I took care of the problem.\"</p>, <p>[What was it this time?]</p>, <p>\"Still manageable... Nothing much yet. A Terror Rank.\"</p>, <p>[.....Terror Rank?]</p>, <p>A certain gravity seized the room after Delilah's words.</p>, <p>A specific classification existed for those originating from the Mirror Dimension.</p>, <p>It was one that the four Empires came to a consensus with.</p>, <p>The ranks were as follows: Infant Rank, Junior Rank, Terror Rank, Destroyer Rank, and Primordial Rank.</p>, <p>The fact that a 'Terror Rank' beast had shown up near the premises of the Institute served as a deep reminder of how grave the situation was.</p>, <p>[It seems like they're becoming bolder and bolder. When was the last time they sent someone this powerful?]</p>, <p>\"Maybe a couple of years ago? I'm not sure.\"</p>, <p>As she spoke, Delilah's hand reached out for her drawer again, and she took out yet another chocolate bar.</p>, <p>\"...But it wasn't anything worth paying attention to.\"</p>, <p>A Terror Rank was a monster that had the equivalent power of a High Wizard.</p>, <p>Her trivialization of its power showed just how powerful she was.</p>, <p>[Were there any other problems...?]</p>, <p>Delilah pondered before carefully saying,</p>, <p>\"...It seems like they're planning something, but I'm not quite sure what. I've already raised the security of the institute, so we shouldn't have any problems, but you might never know.\"</p>, <p>[Yes... Make sure to keep alert. We've already stopped many attempts over the years, but you might never know when they will make a breakthrough.]</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>The call seemed to end on that note, and just as Delilah planned to end it, she heard his voice again,</p>, <p>[.....Oh, there should be a gathering tonight. Are you going to be attending?]</p>, <p>\"Gathering?\"</p>, <p>[Did you forget?]</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>[So you did...]</p>, <p>\"I didn't.\"</p>, <p>For some reason, Delilah felt the need to deny it.</p>, <p>Her pride wasn't allowing her to admit that she had forgotten.</p>, <p>Because...</p>, <p>She really had forgotten.</p>, <p>[Oh, that's good. I'll be seeing you there, then. I'll be going now, and... clean your mouth.]</p>, <p>\"....Uh?\"</p>, <p>The call ended on that note.</p>, <p>Stunned, Delilah reached for her lips, where traces of the chocolate remained.</p>, <p>Her brows slowly knit together.</p>, <p>\"How did he know...?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was late into the night when I reached the destination.</p>, <p>Since it wasn't far, we walked along the campus road to get to the place.</p>, <p>The venue sat at the Academy's outskirts amidst a cluster of villas. The chosen gathering spot distinguished itself effortlessly.</p>, <p>Towering over its neighbors, this particular villa not only boasted impressive size but also flaunted intricate decorations. Bright lights strategically placed accentuated this further, setting it apart from the others.</p>, <p>\"We're here.\"</p>, <p>Having rehearsed the situation beforehand, Leon went ahead of me and handed over our letters to the butler in charge.</p>, <p>He was a young man with black hair, perhaps about my age.</p>, <p>\"It's a pleasure to meet you, Black Star.\"</p>, <p>The butler greeted me after a quick look at the invitation.</p>, <p>His welcoming smile felt rather burdensome as he extended his hand toward the door of the villa, where he proceeded to open it.</p>, <p>[The son of the third head of the Evenus Barony. A first-year cadet and the Black Star. Julien Dacre Evenus.]</p>, <p>Having already been briefed beforehand by Leon, I wasn't startled by the sudden announcement.</p>, <p>I was, however, struggling to keep my face composed.</p>, <p>'I know this is something nobles do... But does it really need to be this exaggerated?'</p>, <p>There was also the issue regarding all the attendees who were now directing their attention toward me.</p>, <p>\"Please have a pleasant night.\"</p>, <p>The butler added. As if he was trying to add salt to my wounds.</p>, <p>\"Huuuu...\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I proceeded forward toward the hall.</p>, <p>I once again reminded myself of my identity.</p>, <p>'I'm Julien Dacre Evenus.'</p>, <p>'The Black Star and the number one ranked cadet in the first years.'</p>, <p>'When people look at me, they are the ones who grow nervous.'</p>, <p>'Not me.'</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, I headed deeper into the venue.</p>, <p>There were a lot of familiar faces as I moved forward. From members of my class to some of the staff and professors I had met over the past week. There were also many unfamiliar faces. Some old and some young.</p>, <p>But there was one person that stood out the most out of all of them.</p>, <p>She seemed to be the center of attention.</p>, <p>The one where the focus gravitated toward.</p>, <p>Aoife K. Megrail.</p>, <p>The Empire's one and only princess.</p>, <p>In a one-piece red dress that accentuated her striking red hair, she stood out, her beauty eclipsing many of those present.</p>, <p>Graceful movements and an elegant demeanor added to her image as she eloquently conversed with those engaging her in conversation.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Just as I noticed her, she noticed me. I thought nothing of it and prepared to look away when, all of a sudden, she smiled.</p>, <p>Smiled...?</p>, <p>I was momentarily taken aback.</p>, <p>So did the many that were looking at her.</p>, <p>By the time I regained my senses, she was standing in front of me. I felt the attention of all those present in the room.</p>, <p>...And just as I looked down to wonder what was happening, her glossy lips parted open, and her crisp voice gently reached my ears.</p>, <p>\"I've been waiting for you.\"</p>, <p>She extended her hand.</p>, <p>\".....Would you give me the honor?\"</p>, <p>The fuc—</p>]\n",

I thought about rejecting her, but seeing how insistent she was being, I decided to go along with it and took a small bite.</p>, <p>It wouldn't hurt anyway.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The moment I took a bite of the pastry, my lips pursed together and I momentarily forgot how to swallow.</p>, <p>Regardless of how hard I tried, it just wouldn't go down.</p>, <p>What the...</p>, <p>\".....As expected.\"</p>, <p>Aoife's lips pulled up in realization.</p>, <p>\"You can't take sweets.\"</p>, <p>I grabbed the nearest tissue and spat out the pastry.

'When did she...' As I glanced around, I found my eyes tracing her back.</p>, <p>For some reason, staring at her back, her steps seemed lighter than usual.</p>, <p>'Crazy.'</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>A sudden tug of my clothes attracted my attention.</p>, <p>I looked around but was left confused.</p>, <p>Nothing.</p>, <p>\"Wh-ah.\"</p>, <p>I lowered my gaze and met two eyes.</p>, <p>Stare—</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>They stared at me with incredible intensity.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"A child?\"</p>, <p>They belonged to a child.

Wasn't this supposed to be a gathering of important people?</p>, <p>Perhaps a child of a professor?</p>, <p>Stare—</p>, <p>Her stare turned even more intense. It was as if lasers were shooting at me.</p>, <p>\"What...?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>The child didn't reply and merely shifted her gaze.</p>, <p>Following her line of sight, I realized.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I held up my hand. The one that was holding the pastry.</p>, <p>\"You want this?\"</p>, <p>Nod. Nod.</p>, <p>Her head bobbed up and down as saliva drooped from the corner of her mouth. She was quick to wipe her lips.</p>, <p>The sight was an amusing one.</p>, <p>\"Here.\"</p>, <p>I handed her the pastry which she quickly took and shoved down her mouth.</p>, <p>The sight left me momentarily stunned.</p>, <p>What sort of situation was this...?</p>, <p>That said, staring at her, my lips gently moved up.</p>, <p>\"Clean up your mouth first.\"</p>, <p>Taking a tissue, I dabbed her mouth.</p>, <p>\"Here too.\"</p>, <p>There were crumbs all over.</p>, <p>\"Just how are you eating...?\"</p>, <p>She reminded me of my brother a lot.</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>I stopped when I realized what I was doing.</p>, <p>She reminded me of him so much that I had acted out of impulse.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, she didn't seem to have minded as she continued to eat the pastries in peace.

With a word, I can make that happen.\"</p>, <p>Leon casually took a sip of his drink, something called 'Amorena' and pursed his lips.</p>, <p>'.....Tastes like shit.'</p>, <p>Far too bitter for his tastes.</p>, <p>\"Do consider our offer. We can offer you a lot more than what the Evenus Household has offered you. You don't have to worry about the consequences.

The place... Everything about it.</p>, <p>It felt extremely stuffy.</p>, <p>\"....How many does that make?\"</p>, <p>A familiar voice reached him from behind. As he turned around, his eyes fell on the familiar figure and he flatly replied.</p>, <p>\"Counting that... About nine.\"</p>, <p> \".....A lot more than I thought.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn scratched the side of her face. Wearing a formal white dress, decorated with purple jewelry and accessories, her appearance attracted the gazes of many of the people attending.</p>, <p>It was hard to stand out given that most of the cadets present looked good themselves, but only a few truly stood out amongst the masses.</p>, <p>Evelyn was one of those few.</p>, <p>\"Probably not as many as the times you've got asked out.\"</p>, <p>\"Rubbing salt to my wounds?\"</p>, <p>Leon lightly shrugged.</p>, <p>\"You started it.\"</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn nodded before her brows knit together.

He was a servant.</p>, <p>Someone that they were willing to discard with a thought.</p>, <p>The wounds of his past were still vividly etched in his mind and not a day passed where he forgot. Even now... He was constantly reminded of those days.</p>, <p>And it was with such thoughts that he ambiguously added,</p>, <p>\"....Not yet.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>As if she had expected such an answer, Evelyn nodded her head and no longer pursued the matter.</p>, <p>She could tell it was a sensitive matter.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's expression changed and her eyes stared off in the distance. Leon followed her line of sight and made a similar expression.</p>, <p>Julien, the first son of the household in question, appeared at the end of the hall.</p>, <p>He was also one of the few that stood out in appearance. His every movement and action attracted the eyes of those present.</p>, <p>It was hard to not take note of him when he stood out that much.</p>, <p>\"He's changed quite a bit...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn started to speak as her eyes traced his figure.</p>, <p>\"Though he carries himself in the same manner as in the past, there's something different about him. Am I the only one that's noticing these changes?\"</p>, <p>\"...It's been five years since you've last seen him.\"</p>, <p>Leon replied flatly.</p>, <p>\"It's normal for him to be different.\"</p>, <p>\"I guess you're right, but...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn narrowed her eyes as her gaze continued to trace Julien's figure.</p>, <p>\"....Wasn't he usually the type of guy that enjoys attention? Why does it seem like he's leaving?\"</p>, <p>\"Leaving?\"</p>, <p>Leon's face finally showed changes, and to his surprise, it was indeed as Evelyn pointed out.</p>, <p>Julien, who had reached the entrance of the hall, was reaching out for his felt jacket.</p>, <p>His actions aroused the attention of many of those attending.</p>, <p>\"What's he doing?\"</p>, <p>\"Did he forget something in his jacket...?\"</p>, <p>It couldn't be helped.</p>, <p>The event had only just begun, and he was already leaving.</p>, <p>The expressions of many of the people present varied. But the consensus was that his decision made no sense.</p>, <p>This was especially so for Leon who put his drink down.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"You're leaving?\"</p>, <p>\"....Yeah.\"</p>, <p>He had no choice but to.</p>, <p>It was his duty to keep Julien safe. Though he wasn't sure why Julien was acting like this, he had no choice but to follow.</p>, <p>Before leaving, he paused to stare at Evelyn.</p>, <p>\"I hope you enjoy the gathering.\"</p>, <p>And with those last words, he went ahead to follow Julien.</p>, <p>As he left, Evelyn's eyes traced his back.</p>, <p>Putting her drink down, she mumbled,</p>, <p>\".....Something's off.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Huuu...\"</p>, <p>The breeze hit my face as I left the venue.</p>, <p>I felt a sense of liberation coming out of the building.</p>, <p>The weight of the stares...</p>, <p>The suffocating environment...</p>, <p>It was all gone.</p>, <p>I could finally breathe properly again.</p>, <p>\"Better.\"</p>, <p>\".....Why did you leave so early?\"</p>, <p>An expected voice reached me from behind. I didn't need to look to know who it was.</p>, <p>\"I felt like it was a waste of time.\"</p>, <p>\"Were you trying hard enough? I doubt you're intimidating to the point where everyone avoids you.\"</p>, <p>Was that the case...?</p>, <p>I thought about it for a while before nodding.</p>, <p>That was probably the case.</p>, <p>\"Maybe so.\"</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"This sort of thing... I'm not fit for it.\"</p>, <p>My body and mind rejected it.</p>, <p>\"It felt too stuffy. I don't think I could've stayed much longer.\"</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>For the first time since meeting him, I heard a long sigh coming from Leon. Stunned, I turned around to see him massaging his forehead.</p>, <p>Eventually, as if resigned, he also loosened his clothes.</p>, <p>\"To be honest, I was feeling the same.\"</p>, <p>Taken aback by his response, my brow raised.</p>, <p>He was?</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"No, nothing...\"</p>, <p>I shook my head and turned to look away.</p>, <p>\"I'm just glad we're on the same page.\"</p>, <p>I smiled and massaged my shoulders. Then, without looking back, I took the path back to Haven.</p>, <p>The distance back wasn't very far.</p>, <p>Rather, it should've been a very short walk. The path was also nice. With no buildings in sight, it provided a great view.</p>, <p>The entire time the two of us remained quiet as we observed the surroundings.</p>, <p>There wasn't much to say between us and all we could do was enjoy the surroundings.</p>, <p>Everything was going smoothly, when...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>My feet came to a stop.</p>, <p>\"Something's wrong...\"</p>, <p>The path, which should've been a short one suddenly felt extremely long. What should've been a ten to five-minute walk extended longer than that.</p>, <p>I had just turned around to address Leon when my body froze.</p>, <p>\"Hey, did yo—Uh?\"</p>, <p>My heart dropped and my heartbeat quickened.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I was alone.</p>, <p>Leon was gone.</p>, <p>When did this…?</p>, <p>I could've sworn I had felt his presence just moments prior.

Thump! Ba...

The sterile scent hinted at the fact that I was in some sort of medical center.</p>, <p>But where exactly?</p>, <p>\"Ukh...\"</p>, <p>Just as I thought to check, my face stiffened.</p>, <p>My entire body was in pain, and I could barely lift my head.</p>, <p>But I also understood something...</p>, <p>'I am safe.'</p>, <p>I didn't know why I felt this way. The place was unfamiliar, and yet... I didn't feel like I was in any danger.</p>, <p>Of course, even if I was in danger... I didn't have the time to think about it.</p>, <p>\"Ukhg...!\"</p>, <p>Memories from before started to flood my mind, and my stomach churned.</p>, <p>I hastily looked around before leaning over the bedside.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>\"Blergh...!\"</p>, <p>Once again, I puked.</p>, <p>\"Blergh...!\"</p>, <p>It all came out at once. I wasn't able to hold it and just flowed out from my stomach.</p>, <p>\"Blergh...!\"</p>, <p>My throat hurt and my eyes started to sting.</p>, <p>I was also struggling to breathe as I barely had any time to catch my breath. It was just endless.</p>, <p>The reality of the situation finally started to hit me...</p>, <p>I had killed someone.</p>, <p>\"...Haa...\"</p>, <p>It wasn't so much that I was distraught by that idea. He had been trying to kill me... I was merely defending myself.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>As I recalled the way that I killed him.</p>, <p>The blood that spilled with each swing.</p>, <p>The smell of it as it invaded my nostrils.</p>, <p>The pieces of his brain that splattered...</p>, <p>\"Blergh...!\"</p>, <p>My stomach once again turned over, and I continued to puke.</p>, <p>But this time...</p>, <p>Nothing came out. I only made the sound, but nothing came out. I had emptied my entire stomach. There was nothing left for me to puke.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I wiped my lips and took deep and even breaths.</p>, <p>I felt like utter shit.</p>, <p>Every time I thought back to the memories, my mouth would gag. I wished I could forget all about that memory and just move on, but...</p>, <p>'I can't forget.'</p>, <p>I mustn't forget.</p>, <p>Like I said, it was time for me to accept the world.</p>, <p>Who I now was... And the morals of this world. I had to accept them. I couldn't stay as Emmet Rowe forever. I had to... become Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>The world didn't reject me.</p>, <p>I rejected it.</p>, <p>And it was time for me to accept it.</p>, <p>From its laws to its morals... I needed to conform my way of thinking to it.</p>, <p>Only this way would I be able to find what I wanted.</p>, <p>Therefore, I closed my eyes and replayed the scene in my mind. Over and over again. I tried to recall all the details. From the sounds to the smells... all that I could think of.</p>, <p>I tried to recall.</p>, <p>\"...Ukgh.\"</p>, <p>My throat gagged each time, but I let my mind immerse in the memories.</p>, <p>I knew that this wasn't going to be enough.</p>, <p>That it was going to take time for me to adjust to this sort of mentality, but... One had to start from somewhere.</p>, <p>And this was my starting point.</p>, <p>Creaaaaak...</p>, <p>The door of the room creaked open as a figure draped in white robes entered. With tall blonde hair and green eyes, he scanned the room and sighed.</p>, <p>\"...I was wondering why there was so much sound.\"</p>, <p>He flicked his hand once, and all the puke on the floor disappeared. So did the smell, which made me feel better.</p>, <p>\"Let's start with the introduction. I'm Dr. Gabel Wright. I'm in charge of healing you.\"</p>, <p>\"...Oh.\"</p>, <p>I lowered my eyes and sat back.</p>, <p>\"Am I at the institute?\"</p>, <p>\"Oh? You're aware?\"</p>, <p>\"Mhm.\"</p>, <p>It wasn't that hard to figure out. I had been thinking about it for a bit, but was it really possible for something like this to happen under the watch of the institute that boasted itself to be the number one in the empire?</p>, <p>No...</p>, <p>That was most likely not the case.</p>, <p>But... If that was the case, why did something like this happen? Were they just incompetent.. or was there more to it?</p>, <p>'Fucking game.'</p>, <p>\"The Chancellor personally brought you back here in the middle of the night. Nobody is aware that you're here yet.\"</p>, <p>Taking out a wooden pad, the doctor glanced at it before continuing.</p>, <p>\"...Broken collarbone, three fractured ribs, a punctured lung, spinal fracture... What sort of situation did you get yourself into?\"</p>, <p>\"Haa..\"</p>, <p>I inwardly laughed. I wanted to know, too.</p>, <p>In the end, I was going to be stuck here for a bit...</p>, <p>Great.</p>, <p>\"Well...\"</p>, <p>Putting the clipboard down, he ruffled his hair.</p>, <p>\"The injuries aren't anything serious or anything like that.\"</p>, <p>\"...?\"</p>, <p>\"So you should be fine with leaving by tomorrow.\"</p>, <p>\"...??\"</p>, <p>\"I'll be leaving to check on my other patients. Rest for now. I'll come to check up on you later.\"</p>, <p>He left just like that.</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>The door closed and silence enveloped the room. I thought back to his words and found myself blinking twice...</p>, <p>\"Injuries aren't anything serious...?\"</p>, <p>Broken collarbone, three fractured ribs, a punctured lung, spinal fracture...</p>, <p>\"Should be fine to leave by tomorrow?\"</p>, <p>This...</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>I couldn't help but laugh.</p>, <p>Although this was another world... It still left me stunned.</p>, <p>\"...Fucking ridiculous.\"</p>, <p>\"What is?\"</p>, <p>\"No, it's...!\"</p>, <p>I abruptly looked to my left, and my eyes widened.</p>, <p>When did she...</p>, <p>Leaning against the nearest table, her long, flowing black hair draped down her shoulder as she cocked her head.</p>, <p>Her appearance was so blinding that I struggled to comprehend what was before me.</p>, <p>\"So...? What's so ridiculous?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Memories started to flood my mind, and I felt my face stiffen.

While she certifiably carried herself as someone of importance, she also gave off a rather odd feeling.</p>, <p>Like…</p>, <p>'Scary.'</p>, <p>I couldn't quite put it into words.</p>, <p>But she seemed to have two sides of her.

I noticed.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn, who was staring at Leon's hand, tilted her head.</p>, <p>\"How did yo—\"</p>, <p>She stopped herself mid-sentence and her eyes opened.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>There was someone else that had been missing today.</p>, <p>Could it be...</p>, <p>She looked at Leon who was blankly staring into the distance, his thoughts unknown.</p>, <p>\"It's probably not what you're thinking.\"</p>, <p>Aoife, who had been quiet the entire time, finally spoke.</p>, <p>\"No. I—\"</p>, <p>\"If the two of them really fought, I don't think the situation would be as quiet as this. The two of them would be in the disciplinary hall.\"</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Fighting among cadets was prohibited. If cadets were caught fighting against each other, they'd be severely punished by the school board.</p>, <p>Still, such rules couldn't stop Evelyn from overthinking.</p>, <p>'But what if they fought without the institute knowing?'</p>, <p>Would the institute interfere then?...And if they really had fought, who won between the two of them?</p>, <p>\"Never mind that...\"</p>, <p>Luxon switched up the conversation.</p>, <p>\"The situation is getting rather troublesome, right?...I thought things would calm down after a while, but it seems like they're hell-bent on pushing us down.\"</p>, <p>\"Right... It's getting quite annoying.\"</p>, <p>Factions were already starting to form between the first years. Primarily, it was the commoners banding up together against the nobles. The situation wasn't hard to handle, however, there were already a few conflicts between the lower-end nobles and commoners.</p>, <p>The worst part of it all was that Aoife had indirectly become the face of the situation when she interfered with an emerging conflict where she ended up defending the lower-end nobles.</p>, <p>Cooly looking into the distance, she said,</p>, <p>\"Two sides were fighting so I just stopped the fight. I interfered without knowing the situation. Because of it... I'm now dragged into this situation. I already warned them that I want no part in this, but they refuse to listen.\"</p>, <p>While the Megrail name held a lot of weight, within the institute, it was a meaningless title.</p>, <p>The only title that actually mattered was that of the Black Star. Such situations were not common as the cadets usually banded with the Black Star.</p>, <p>It was the Black Star's role to stop such meaningless conflict.</p>, <p>But things were different this year with the Black Star not caring at all about creating factions and banding the first years together.</p>, <p>He was the primary reason why a situation like this had happened.</p>, <p>Had she been the Black Star, then...</p>, <p>Aoife quietly bit her lips and looked at Leon.</p>, <p>\"Do you think you can get him to do something?\"</p>, <p>Leon looked down and met Aoife's eyes. He stared at her for a while before shaking his head.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>A flat-out refusal.</p>, <p>\"Even if you force him, he won't do it. He hates these kinds of things.\"</p>, <p>\"Are you sure?\"</p>, <p>When Luxon asked, Leon nodded.</p>, <p>\"Very sure.\"</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>With a curse, Luxon ruffled his hair.</p>, <p>\"....Why did the institute choose someone like him to be the Black Star? If he can't even fulfill his own role, then what's the point in keeping him there? At the rate the situation is going, the first years will be split into different factions. That has never happened before. We'll become the laughingstock of the second and third years.\"</p>, <p>At that, nobody answered. His words held some truth.</p>, <p>With Julien not fulfilling his role as the Black Star, the first years were in a mess.</p>, <p>At the rate they were going, the conflicts would get to the point where they would start interfering with everyone's studies.</p>, <p>The grim reality made Evelyn frown as she asked,</p>, <p>\"What do we do?\"</p>, <p>Aoife, who had been frowning the entire time, suddenly relaxed her brows.</p>, <p>\"There's one thing we can do.\"</p>, <p>Everyone looked at her.</p>, <p>But just as she spoke, Evelyn's eyes widened. So did Luxon's. A figure appeared in their sight.</p>, <p>Gulp—</p>, <p>Evelyn felt a lump in her throat.</p>, <p>With calm and even steps, he neared them.</p>, <p>A perfect face.</p>, <p>With an aura distinct from the others, and cold eyes befitting his visage, he seemed to be the center of attention wherever he went.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>Finally, his expression...</p>, <p>It was extremely cold. Especially his eyes which shone like well-polished jewels.</p>, <p>\"During the mid-terms...\"</p>, <p>He stopped right behind Aoife who finished her sentence.</p>, <p>\"... I'll take the title away from him.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Her face remained blank as she felt a presence behind her. Taking note of the change in expressions of Evelyn and Luxon, Aoife had an idea of what was going on.</p>, <p>She coolly turned her head.</p>, <p>\"You're here.\"</p>, <p>He stood taller than her, her height just barely reaching his chin.</p>, <p>'He heard, didn't he?'</p>, <p>There was no way he hadn't.</p>, <p>\"....I am.\"</p>, <p>Indeed, hearing his confirmation, Aoife closed her eyes briefly. Then, collecting her thoughts, she spoke,</p>, <p>\"Did you hear what I said?\"</p>, <p>\"I have.\"</p>, <p>Julien continued to stare at her with his usual detached eyes.</p>, <p>Aoife calmly stared into those eyes.</p>, <p>'Those arrogant eyes... I wonder how long you'll be able to keep them like that?'</p>, <p>Regardless of whether he had heard her or not, she didn't care. Her goal had always been to reach the top. Become the Zenith.</p>, <p>The fact that she wasn't ranked first in her year was already a huge blow to her ambition.</p>, <p>It wasn't something she had expected.</p>, <p>And for there to be two people who stood above her...</p>, <p>How could she accept something like this?</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>\"The Black Star is not just a title. It is something that comes with responsibility. The situation is as is because you aren't doing your job.\"</p>, <p>Aoife didn't care if she came off as uptight, or annoying. There was a little truth in that. She was self-aware of that much.</p>, <p>However, her words were the truth and the truth only.</p>, <p>\"It is your duty to make sure that all sides get along. Not me, but yours.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Aoife expected Julien to say something back, refute her words, and dismiss her in some way. Give her an excuse to openly challenge him.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>That never came.</p>, <p>Julien's expression eased and he took a step back. Without saying a single word, he turned around to glance into the distance. Where the other students were.</p>, <p>\"....What am I supposed to do?\"</p>, <p>Aoife's brows raised in surprise.</p>, <p>Her reaction was the mildest one. The one who had the greatest reaction was Evelyn who opened her eyes and looked at Julien with an expression that seemed as though she couldn't believe what she was seeing.</p>, <p>No, she really couldn't believe what she was seeing.</p>, <p>\"I never asked to be the Black Star...\"</p>, <p>He started to speak while glancing into the distance. His hazel eyes shone under the light of the sun while his well-kept hair swayed lightly under the breeze.</p>, <p> Aoife quietly listened to his words, her hands silently tensing. She was expecting him to look at her in disdain while saying something along the lines of, 'Do it yourself. Don't bother me with these meaningless tasks.'</p>, <p>She could already envision the scene in her mind.</p>, <p>\"...But just because I didn't ask to become the Black Star doesn't mean that I don't care for it. I have it, so I'd like to keep it.\"</p>, <p>However, to her surprise, he did none of that.</p>, <p>Rather, he did something completely out of her expectations.</p>, <p>\"So...\"</p>, <p>Lowering his head slightly, he deeply looked at everyone present.</p>, <p>\".....Tell me what I'm supposed to do when the time comes.\"</p>, <p>Following his words, he walked past them.</p>, <p>Aoife stood dazed even as his scent faded away.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She just stood blankly on the spot.</p>, <p>The same was true for the others.</p>, <p>\"Did he just...\"</p>, <p>Luxon was the first one to break the silence as his head turned to stare at the departing Julien.</p>, <p>He turned to look at Leon.</p>, <p>\"Didn't you say he wasn't going to do it? Was that just a lie? \"</p>, <p>\".....No.\"</p>, <p>Similarly confused, Leon's head turned to stare at Julien's back. Judging from his expression, he too seemed shocked by the situation.</p>, <p>Even though the situation turned out for the better...</p>, <p>'I don't like this.'</p>, <p>'Without meaning to, I got swept in his rhythm.'</p>, <p>Aoife was annoyed. Her neck heated and her hands tingled.</p>, <p>His mannerisms and the matter-of-fact tone he spoke with... It made it seem as though he was treating her as his servant.</p>, <p>'Why am I the one that is supposed to tell you?'</p>, <p>'You said you wanted to keep your role but demand others to tell you how to do that role...'</p>, <p>No, if you really wanted to do something, you'd already have done it by now. Just say a word or two... Show them your presence. Interfere personally. We shouldn't be the ones to tell you what you're supposed to do.</p>, <p>I'm not your secretary.</p>, <p>\"What should we do? Should we gather the leaders of the factions to talk to him?\"</p>, <p>Luxon asked tactlessly. Aoife secretly clenched her teeth and kept her expression firm.</p>, <p>\".....You figure that out amongst yourselves.\"</p>, <p>She then went on to leave on her own.</p>, <p>\"Eh? Aoife...! Where are you going?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Tak—</p>, <p>Aoife kept walking despite hearing her name getting called out repeatedly by Luxon.</p>, <p>'How laughable.'</p>, <p>The entire situation was.</p>, <p>She wanted his help.</p>, <p>....And yet.</p>, <p>When he offered his help, she found herself growing mad.</p>, <p>Hypocrisy?</p>, <p>Maybe...</p>, <p>But it also became clear to Aoife.</p>, <p>The entire reason she was acting this way.</p>, <p>She had thought she had managed to bury such emotions—weaknesses—deep within her mind, but...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She silently stared at her hand. It was trembling slightly.</p>, <p>The reality of the situation hit her and her face cracked.</p>, <p>\"Heh...\"</p>, <p>A laugh escaped.</p>, <p>\"...How ridiculous. Me of all people...\"</p>, <p>Indeed.</p>, <p>She was jealous.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was late into the night, and I was back in my room.</p>, <p>In this familiar environment, I sat down on the ground and stared at my hand. A beautiful purple magic circle hovered above the tips of my fingers.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>Even as sweat dripped from my head, I kept my gaze fixed on the circle in front of me.</p>, <p>\"I... really did it.\"</p>, <p>I still couldn't believe it.</p>, <p>The reality that was displayed in front of me.</p>, <p>I... could finally use my first true spell. Outside of Emotive Magic, this was my very first spell.</p>, <p>Ziiing—</p>, <p>I gently lifted my hand up, inserting it into the magic circle which slowly moved down. Gradually, my hand started to change, turning completely purple.</p>, <p>Just like last time, purple spots started to appear in my vision.</p>, <p>The furthest one was all the way toward the end of the living room. About fifteen meters away.</p>, <p>\"....Is that the limit of my range?\"</p>, <p>I moved back and the purple spot followed after.</p>, <p>\"Seems to be the case.\"</p>, <p>I pushed my hand forward and lightly tapped on the spot.</p>, <p>Swoosh—!</p>, <p>Tangible purple hands began to sprout from the ground. One... Two... Three... Four... There were a total of four. They rose from the ground and tried to latch on to whatever was on top of them.</p>, <p>This persisted for several seconds before the hands shattered.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>By the time the spell was done, I was on my last breath.</p>, <p>My mana reserves were almost depleted. I had been at it for quite a while so it was only natural that I was tired.</p>, <p>\"Five...\"</p>, <p>That was the amount of times I could use the spell before running out of mana.</p>, <p>My current limit.</p>, <p>\"Hooo...\"</p>, <p>I lay on the floor with my arms wide.</p>, <p>I was tired.</p>, <p>I was exhausted.</p>, <p>I was on my last breath.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Haha...\"</p>, <p>I think...</p>, <p>I was addicted.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>10:00 A.M.

The facility was extremely large, with over a thousand square meters of space, it was massive.</p>, <p>Today was an unusual class.</p>, <p>\"Progression Analysis. Every quarter we will examine the cadet's progression throughout the year. There will be three things measured in the test. First, mana quantity and quality. Second, physical fitness, and lastly, mind endurance.\"</p>, <p>The professor in charge, a tall woman with long blonde hair and green eyes, Olivia J. Kelson started to explain.</p>, <p>\"With the institute trying to ready you to enter the Mirror Dimension, it is important that we focus on all three aspects. Even if you are a mage, maintaining your body to a certain standard is necessary. In the chance that you find yourself in a situation where you can't defeat your opponent and are forced to run, your physical stamina will be an important factor.\"</p>, <p>She went on to talk about the importance of each testing point and how it would benefit us in the long term.</p>, <p>I carefully listened to each one of her words and made sure to take notes in my mind.</p>, <p>I was still a stranger to this world, and although what she was saying could be perceived as 'common sense'. Not all common sense applied to me.</p>, <p>There were certain things that I was unaware of.</p>, <p>\"I will now divide you into three groups. There, you will follow your assigned assistant to take on the testing.\"</p>, <p>Names started to get called out one by one.

He stood tall, towering over my figure, and his thick eyebrows were knit into a frown as he stared at me.</p>, <p>For some reason, I felt the impression that he didn't quite like me...</p>, <p>Was it just me?</p>, <p>'Maybe.'</p>, <p>It could just be that he just looked intimidating.</p>, <p>For now, under the watchful eyes of all the students and staff, I made my way toward my group. A couple of familiar faces entered my vision when I walked forward.</p>, <p>More specifically a girl with long white hair and red eyes.</p>, <p>I stared at her for a brief moment and as if she could sense my gaze, her head turned and our eyes met.</p>, <p>Immediately, her face turned to one of displeasure. Loathing almost.</p>, <p>'...I guess she still remembers the incident from before.'</p>, <p>The one regarding the cigarette.</p>, <p>Indeed, that was my fault. I shouldn't have acted like that.</p>, <p>\"Hurry along, we don't have all day to wait for you.\"</p>, <p>A rough voice directed itself toward me. When I looked up, I saw the assistant professor glaring at me from the distance.</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>This guy...</p>, <p>He really did hate me after all.</p>, <p>But why...?</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Knowing about the possible agenda against me, I kept my mouth shut and joined the group.</p>, <p>And as if I had some godly timing, the moment I joined the ground, the professor was done recounting all the names.</p>, <p>\"I'm done over here.\"</p>, <p>She looked toward the assistant professors and announced.</p>, <p>\"You may begin with the tests. Group one, please head toward the physical test. Group two, head for the mana test, and group three... Please proceed to the mental test.\"</p>, <p>We were group two which meant that our test was the mana test.</p>, <p>A part of me already dreaded the test knowing that my performance was going to be awful, but at the same time... I couldn't wait for the test.</p>, <p>What other people cared about me or whatnot. That was meaningless to me. What I cared about the most was seeing my current level.</p>, <p>Get a general idea of my overall level so that I could gauge the areas I needed to improve on.</p>, <p>\"Once everyone is done with the test, we'll alternate sections. Off you go.\"</p>, <p>These were the last words of the professor before we were led by our respective assistant professors toward our designated section.</p>, <p>The space was large.</p>, <p>About the size of a classroom.</p>, <p>In the space, a large magic circle was drawn on the ground where a large table sat and three orbs appeared.</p>, <p>\"This is the Mana Resonance Assessment.\"</p>, <p>The rough voice of the assistant professor began to spread.</p>, <p>\"The test is simple. There are three orbs on the table. Each orb has its own distinctive function.\"</p>, <p>He pointed toward the orbs.</p>, <p>\"The one on the left measures your mana quantity. The one in the middle measures your mana purity, and the one on the right measures your mana control. All you have to do is place your hand over the orb and channel your mana.

            "[<p>\"What do you think...? How are the results for this year?\"</p>, <p>Professor Kelson's voice echoed as she stood by the end of the training ground with her three other assistant professors.</p>, <p>The day was almost over, and so far each group had taken two of the three assessments they were supposed to take.</p>, <p>They were at the moment all taking a break. Be it professors or students.</p>, <p>\"...From my group, several students stand out.\"</p>, <p>One of the Assistant Professors, a young woman with short black hair commented.</p>, <p>She went on to say,</p>, <p>\"Evelyn from the Verlice family, and Luxon from the Ravenscroft family. They scored quite high on the Mana examination test, with 2.58 and 2.31 respectively. They've also scored quite highly on the Mental examination test, with a score of 2.01 and 2.11 respectively... Their results already surpass that of the top cadets of last year's batch.\"</p>, <p>\"Hmmm.\"</p>, <p>Professor Kelson quietly nodded while listening to the report. Indeed, the results were quite frightening.</p>, <p>For first-year cadets to reach a score above 2 was quite rare. That signified that the cadet was already in the Tier 2 range.</p>, <p>Such feat was extremely rare and only occasionally would the academy be blessed with such individuals.</p>, <p>For two to appear...</p>, <p>\"I'd like to add to that.\"</p>, <p>A tall man with long black hair and a skinny frame displayed his clipboard.</p>, <p>\"Actually... It's about my group.\"</p>, <p>His expression was quite serious.</p>, <p>\"My group took part in the Physical and Mental examination. Two students stood out in my group as well. It's just that...\"</p>, <p>He took a short pause while looking at the clipboard in his hand. Scratching the back of his head, his face scrunched up in what appeared to be disbelief.</p>, <p>\"I really can't believe we had such monsters in our year... Leon Ellert. Physical examination score, 2.91. Mental examination score, 2.98. Aoife Megrail. Physical examination score, 2.87. Mental examination score, 3.01...\"</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>\"Th-this...!\"</p>, <p>A still silence shrouded the space as Professor Kelson and the other assistants gaped at the results.</p>, <p>It took a while before they could recollect themselves, and when they did, one of them asked again to make sure they hadn't heard wrong.</p>, <p>\"....I didn't hear wrongly, right? Did you just...\"</p>, <p>\"Leon Ellert. Physical examination score, 2.91. Mental examination score, 2.98. Aoife Megrail. Physical examination score, 2.87. Mental examination score, 3.01...\"</p>, <p>The assistant professor repeated.</p>, <p>Only when he repeated did it finally sink into the mind of those present as they looked at each other at a complete loss for words.</p>, <p>\"Monsters...\"</p>, <p>Breaking the silence was Professor Kelson who looked at the clipboard incredulously while repeating.</p>, <p>\"...We've got monsters this year.\"</p>, <p>And then, her gaze finally fell on the last assistant professor.</p>, <p>\"What about you Gilbert? Any notable figures from your group?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>His deep voice quietly echoed out in the group.</p>, <p> Taking out his clipboard, he frowned.</p>, <p>\".....Only one though.\"</p>, <p>Whether he spoke out of disappointment or not, nobody could be sure. His expression was hard to read.</p>, <p>He began to announce,</p>, <p>\"Kiera Mylne. Mana examination test, 2.504. Physical examination test, 2.281.\"</p>, <p>\"Another monster...\"</p>, <p>\"Wow.\"</p>, <p>The other assistant professors seemed impressed by her performance. All but Professor Kelson who saw the crux of the problem.</p>, <p>\"The Black Star...\"</p>, <p>She began to speak,</p>, <p>\"Wasn't he in your group? What was his result?\"</p>, <p>\"That's what I want to talk about...\"</p>, <p>Finally, a shift occurred in Gilbert's expression as it darkened.</p>, <p>\"Julien Evenus. Mana examination test, 1.716. Physical examination test, 1.189.\"</p>, <p>Gilbert's grip on the board tightened.</p>, <p>\"....He's currently ranked amongst the last in my group in terms of average. An embarrassment.\"</p>, <p>The utter disregard in his tone couldn't be hidden. Although he tried his best to keep himself from displaying such emotion, it was starting to become hard when confronted with such results.</p>, <p>'He is not fit to be the Black Star.'</p>, <p>That was the only thought that ran through his mind.</p>, <p>\"Those are indeed quite low scores.\"</p>, <p>The Professor couldn't deny it. Her gaze turned toward the distance where a particular figure appeared. He easily stood out from the rest of the students. Just his appearance was enough to warrant that.</p>, <p>But there was also the fact that he stood alone, with the cadets actively avoiding him.</p>, <p>It was hard for her to not spot him under such circumstances.</p>, <p>She rubbed her forehead.</p>, <p>\"For now, we can do nothing about this. Let's proceed with the next examination. I'd like to go home early. Who knows, he might do a little better in the next examination.\"</p>, <p>\"...I doubt that.\"</p>, <p>Gilbert went on to put his clipboard under his armpit and headed back for his group. The last examination was the mental test. Of all the other examinations, it was the hardest one to score a high grade on.</p>, <p>He doubted Julien could do well in such an examination given how miserably he had performed in the other examinations.</p>, <p>As he walked, he shook his head.</p>, <p>'...Pathetic.'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Word of Julien's score started to spread amongst the first-year cadets. Many showed surprised looks while others didn't seem as surprised.</p>, <p>\"Did you hear about Julien's score...?\"</p>, <p>\"I did.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...\"</p>, <p>\"Nothing surprising.\"</p>, <p>Leon stretched his muscles while secretly channeling the mana in his body. His next test was up. The mana examination one. He planned on doing well in that one too.</p>, <p>\"What's up with your reaction? Why do you seem so unsurprised?\"</p>, <p>\"Because I'm not.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, Leon turned his head and looked at Evelyn. She was constantly alternating her head between him and Julien.</p>, <p>\"At this rate won't he get in trouble? As his knight, won't that affect you?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>When she put it like that...</p>, <p>\"I'll be fine.\"</p>, <p>Thinking about it, there was no need for him to worry.</p>, <p>\"He'll also be fine.\"</p>, <p>\"But...\"</p>, <p>\"I wouldn't be as relaxed as you are.\"</p>, <p>A voice suddenly interrupted. When Leon turned his head, he saw Aoife approaching their direction.</p>, <p>Her gaze similarly fell on Julien who was standing by himself in the distance.</p>, <p>\"He managed to deter people from approaching him during the first lecture thanks to his performance. However, now that the results are out... How long do you think before someone challenges him?\"</p>, <p>\"....I'm not sure.\"</p>, <p>Leon truthfully answered.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Aoife blankly stared at Leon for a few seconds and shook her head while silently muttering in a low voice, 'Are you really his knight?' before steading her expression again.</p>, <p>\"You're forgetting that we currently need him. I won't be able to take his title away until the Mid-terms. In that case, he needs to make sure he retains his image.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Leon quietly listened to Aoife speak as he kept his gaze locked on her. She seemed rather adamant about taking his spot when the mid-terms came.</p>, <p>He couldn't exactly put that against her.</p>, <p>The title of the 'Black Star' carried a lot of significance. Be it within the institute, and politically.</p>, <p>\".....He's still fine because of what he pulled during the first day and the fact that the institute wouldn't grant someone the title without merit. However, at this rate, people will start forgetting this.\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned while gently brushing her red locks behind her ears.</p>, <p>\"There's a high chance he won't be able to perform well in his last test. I suggest you prepare yourself for the after-effects. It won't be big, but you'll need to be ready for it.\"</p>, <p>She paused and turned to look at Leon.</p>, <p>\".....Because you'll also be at the center of it. As his knight.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>After a short break, we were led toward a strange device that sat in the middle of the training grounds. From where I was, I could still see the other groups readying themselves for the upcoming examinations.</p>, <p>In the end, my results ended up being subpar.</p>, <p>The way some of the cadets looked at me changed as my results spread. While none of them still seemed keen on targeting me, I could feel some of the bolder cadets entertaining the idea.</p>, <p>'How troublesome.'</p>, <p>It was indeed getting troublesome, but it was still manageable.</p>, <p>I wasn't afraid of getting challenged. In fact, I more than entertained the idea.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'I wonder if my current self is capable of even putting up a performance...?'</p>, <p>The only thing I had was Emotive Magic and a single spell that I could hardly use. It was quite obvious to me that I would end up losing pathetically.</p>, <p>Even so...</p>, <p>A part of me really wanted to fight. Not because I didn't care about losing, but because I knew it was the fastest way to grow.</p>, <p>\"The Mental Examination can be said to be the hardest test yet. It won't be testing your mana or your physical abilities, but the firmness of your mind. To be able to withstand pain under critical situations, to be able to remain composed under serious situations...\"</p>, <p>The assistant professor began to introduce us to the examination.</p>, <p>\"This is one of the most important assessments you will face so make sure you try your best.\"</p>, <p>He then proceeded to point at the device that stood behind him. At a glance, it seemed to be a regular chair.</p>, <p>No, maybe it was...</p>, <p>\"The test is simple.\"</p>, <p>The assistant professor took out a small metallic black bracelet from his pocket.</p>, <p>\"This is the device that we will use for the examination. It overloads your sensory systems with all sorts of feelings. But primarily, it will give you pain. Your main job is to withstand the pain for as long as you can without screaming or passing out. The more time passes, the greater the pain.\"</p>, <p>Searching around with his eyes, his gaze eventually fell on a particular figure. One with long white hair and red eyes.</p>, <p>\"Kiera, you will be the one to try it first.\"</p>, <p>'Haa... This...'</p>, <p>I wanted to laugh at the situation. The order until now had always been the same. Me first, then Kiera, and so on...</p>, <p>The reason why he hadn't called my name was fairly obvious.</p>, <p>I wasn't the only one who noticed. The other cadets noticed too as they threw second glances my way.</p>, <p>I kept my expression firm while staring ahead.</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>Kiera walked up to the chair and sat down.</p>, <p>\"Put this on.\"</p>, <p>Taking the bracelet, she put it on her wrist as it latched itself onto it. She didn't seem at all nervous and leaned back on the chair.</p>, <p>On the other hand, the assistant professor took out a small device from his pocket. A stopwatch of some sort, and pressed on the top end.</p>, <p>\"Let's begin.\"</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>Her body jolted immediately after the assistant professor's voice fell. Her eyes shot open while the bracelet in her hand trembled.</p>, <p>\"Akh... ukh...!\"</p>, <p>Her struggle wasn't as pronounced at first. However, with the passing of the seconds, her body started to tremble with more intensity.</p>, <p>\"Don't scream. If you scream, you fail.\"</p>, <p>The assistant professor's cold voice served to remind her to keep herself composed.</p>, <p>\"0.1\"</p>, <p>\"0.2\"</p>, <p>\"0.3\"</p>, <p>As well as recounting her score.</p>, <p>\"0.8\"</p>, <p>\"0.9\"</p>, <p>\"1.0\"</p>, <p>\"Akh...!\"</p>, <p>The moment the count hit 1.0, the pain seemed to escalate to a different level as Kiera's body spasmed with even more force.</p>, <p>Even so, she kept herself from screaming.</p>, <p>The surroundings were quiet as all eyes were fixed on her.</p>, <p>\"1.7\"</p>, <p>\"1.8\"</p>, <p>\"1.9\"</p>, <p>\"2.0\"</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>Her body jolted and her head smacked back. Her entire body spasmed, and for the briefest moment, she almost screamed.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>With some absurd level of willpower, she was able to keep herself from screaming.</p>, <p>Kata! Kata! Kata!</p>, <p>The chair rattled with force asnd her body continued to trash around.</p>, <p>\"2.1\"</p>, <p>\"2.2\"</p>, <p>The count continued.</p>, <p>Her legs flayed in random directions.</p>, <p>\"Akh...! Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>Saliva spit out from her mouth as she clenched her teeth tightly and glared ahead.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>\"2.5\"</p>, <p>\"2.6\"</p>, <p>\"2.7\"</p>, <p>The count continued.</p>, <p>Everyone stood in silence, staring at her with heavy expressions as she continued to trash around.</p>, <p>She looked like she had lost her mind by this point, but the fact that she had yet to scream proved she had lost anything but her mind...</p>, <p>She was still there.</p>, <p>Hanging there.</p>, <p>Withholding the pain. It was almost impressive.</p>, <p>But that eventually came to an end...</p>, <p>\".....Akhhhhhhhhhh!\"</p>, <p>Her scream ended up piercing through her silence as her body started to spasm uncontrollably.</p>, <p>Click--!</p>, <p>A gentle click sounded that moment and her body finally relaxed.</p>, <p>Only when she fully calmed down and was capable of moving her body again did the assistant professor announce her result.</p>, <p>\"Kiera Mylne. Mental Examination score... 2.93.\"</p>, <p>Swoosh!</p>, <p>The expression of many of the students changed after hearing the score with many looking at her with traces of awe.</p>, <p>I too was impressed by her score.</p>, <p>Although I wasn't sure how much it hurt, the way she was trashing about and her expression, it must've hurt a lot.</p>, <p>\"Next cadet.\"</p>, <p>But things moved on rather quickly.</p>, <p>Another cadet was called.</p>, <p>\"Jaylen Roshtelia.\"</p>, <p>Yet again my name wasn't called.</p>, <p>A tall man with short black hair moved forward and sat down on the chair.</p>, <p>\"You've seen the steps.

Silence gripped the training grounds as every gaze fixated on the figure seated in the distance.</p>, <p>His demeanor remained unwavering, just as impeccably poised as ever.</p>, <p>Despite the creased clothes and disheveled hair, his expression retained the usual indifference it always carried.</p>, <p>The blood trickling down his eyes seemed inconsequential to him as if it was never there to begin with.</p>, <p>And so were the stares.</p>, <p>\".....It's possible apparently.\"</p>, <p>It was Leon who brought Evelyn out of her thoughts. With a slight furrow of his brow, he tapped lightly against the sword at his hip.</p>, <p>His expression was hard to read, but to Evelyn, who had known him for as long as she had, it was evident that he, too, had been taken aback by the unfolding events.</p>, <p>'He doesn't like to show it, but he's shaken as well...'</p>, <p>Why else would be tapping on the tip of his sword so much...?</p>, <p>\"He's got a firm mind.\"</p>, <p>Leon concluded after a while, and the tapping stopped.</p>, <p>\".....A very firm mind.\"</p>, <p>He repeated.</p>, <p>In a manner that seemed to be more for him, than for her.</p>, <p>Very firm mind...?</p>, <p>Evelyn blinked, recalling the scene from before.</p>, <p>It was nothing at first. Nobody had been curious about his result at first. Everyone was doing their thing. Focused on their upcoming examination.</p>, <p>That was...</p>, <p>Until a change began to take place in the training ground.</p>, <p>The noise that once filled the surroundings died down and what replaced it was a strange silence.</p>, <p>One that started to consume the surroundings bit by it, swallowing it whole by the next minute.</p>, <p>At first, Evelyn was confused.</p>, <p>But when she turned her head she understood.</p>, <p>'4.4'</p>, <p>Even now...</p>, <p>Recalling the professor's gruff voice as the count went down, she felt herself lose her breath.</p>, <p>4.4...</p>, <p>Had she heard wrong? How was this possible...?</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'4.5'</p>, <p>The rough voice continued.</p>, <p>It thundered in her ears, and the ears of all present.</p>, <p>Most gripping was Julien's steadfast figure as he sat in the middle of the chair. His back was firm, solidly placed on the chair as if nothing was happening.</p>, <p> His eyes were closed and so were his lips.</p>, <p>....His composed expression seemed unfitting to the occasion.</p>, <p>It was to the point where one questioned whether he was truly undergoing the tough experience they had all gone through.</p>, <p>'Is the test faulty? Is something wrong with it...?'</p>, <p>Seeing him like that, Evelyn couldn't help but start doubting the situation. Even now she could still recall the spine tingling and terrifying sensation she felt during the test.

It was starting to betray him.</p>, <p>She understood then...</p>, <p>She hadn't heard wrong...</p>, <p>He truly...</p>, <p>\"Just what the hell happened in the last five years?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's gaze fell on Leon. Her eyes deeply stared into his as he turned his head to look away from her.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>He didn't say much, but his silence told her many things.</p>, <p>In the end...</p>, <p>Something did happen in the five years they hadn't seen each other. Something terrifying enough to turn him like that.</p>, <p>But what...?</p>, <p>What happened?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"We've only just recently parted ways, and you're already back here...\"</p>, <p>The familiar doctor grumbled while he shone a light on my eyes. It was quite bright, and I reflexively tried to close my eyes.</p>, <p>\"Help me out here.\"</p>, <p>After the examination, I was brought to the infirmary by Professor Kelson to get my eyes checked. I didn't resist. I too was a little worried about my eyes. It wasn't normal for someone to bleed from their eyes.</p>, <p>\"....Do you feel any pain?\"</p>, <p>\"I don't.\"</p>, <p>It was strange. A weird sensation had taken hold of my body. I felt light all over. My entire body was numb, and be it pain, or the sense of touch... I had lost it all.</p>, <p>Smack—!</p>, <p>A loud smack caught my attention. When I looked down, I noticed a red mark on my thigh and looked up.</p>, <p>\"Did you feel anything?\"</p>, <p>\"....No.\"</p>, <p>Did he just....</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>The Doctor sighed and turned back to look at the Professor.</p>, <p>\"He's fine, but he's temporarily lost his sense of pain and touch. It shouldn't last longer than a week, but things will be rather troublesome for him in the next week. I suggest he doesn't do anything big in the next week for his own sake.\"</p>, <p>He then proceeded to look at me in the eyes.</p>, <p>\".....I'll say this now because I don't want to see you again over here.

Don't do anything that involves moderate to light exercise. It may seem like nothing, but you've lost your sense of pain. You won't know when you're overexerting your body when you train.

There was a high chance that by the time I was done training, I'd also be done with this life.</p>, <p>Still....</p>, <p>Even though I knew all of this...</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth.</p>, <p>It was frustrating.</p>, <p>While a week didn't sound like much, it was a lot of time for me.

I really couldn't afford to miss out on so many days of training.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath to calm myself down.</p>, <p>'Right, the situation is like this.

By any right, he was a handsome man.</p>, <p>\"Father.\"</p>, <p>He addressed politely as he entered.</p>, <p>\"....Linus.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Linus lowered his head in acknowledgment.

He put the paper down and looked up.</p>, <p>\".....Is this real?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Aldric nodded.</p>, <p>\"I haven't told you yet because I found it hard to believe myself.

Now that she sat down, she needed to sit there for at least five minutes before leaving.</p>, <p>'I was too impulsive.'</p>, <p>Now, she had to pay the consequences of her actions.</p>, <p>Or so she thought.</p>, <p>Creaaak...</p>, <p>Julien's chair scraped as he stood up. Their eyes met for a brief moment before he scanned the books and selected a few.</p>, <p>\"....Are you leaving?\"</p>, <p>Aoife felt compelled to ask. If so, then she didn't have to leave.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>He didn't reply to her. It was as if he wasn't even listening to her. Aoife's lips opened. For the first time in a while, she was unsure of what to do. She felt a strange sense of humiliation in this entire ordeal as her face flushed a further shade of red.</p>, <p>Her gaze eventually fell on one of the many books he left on the table and she didn't hesitate to take it.</p>, <p>\"Since that's the case, you won't mind me taking this, right?\"</p>, <p>Tok Tok.</p>, <p>Julien's calm footsteps echoed as he headed out for the library.</p>, <p>His back had always been turned on her. The utter disregard he had for her had Aoife's gears further, and just as she opened her mouth to say something again, he pointed at his ear.</p>, <p>\"....Can't hear.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It may have seemed like I was exaggerating, but I genuinely was hurting in my ears. What sort of singing was that...?</p>, <p>It felt as though someone was scraping a window with their nails.</p>, <p>Goosebumps.</p>, <p>All I felt were goosebumps.</p>, <p>'It's a bit of a pity for that book that I left, but I can't focus with her here.'</p>, <p>There was one book I really wanted to read but unfortunately couldn't. Mainly because it was a waste of time and I couldn't afford to waste time.</p>, <p>Now then...</p>, <p>To Tok—</p>, <p>I knocked on the familiar door.</p>, <p>\"Come in.\"</p>, <p>A voice I was starting to grow familiar with answered, and I opened the door.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Only to stop at the entrance.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>I blinked. Then blinked again. Then turned around and prepared to head out.</p>, <p>\"You don't have to clean this up. I'll do it... Later.\"</p>, <p>I stopped dead in my tracks and turned around. Ignoring all the wrappers and papers on the floor, I headed back into the office space.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Delilah just stared at me with a blank look, but I ignored her. She also didn't pursue the matter and continued.</p>, <p>\"How many spells do you know?\"</p>, <p>Spells?</p>, <p>I counted in my head.</p>, <p>If we counted the six basic emotions, there were only two.</p>, <p>\"Eight.\"</p>, <p>\"Eight? Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Delilah frowned.</p>, <p>\"I assume six of them are the six basic emotions, correct?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>With a quiet nod, she leaned back on her chair and crossed her arms. She then proceeded to ask,</p>, <p>\"How far have you learned?\"</p>, <p>\"Both beginner. I have only unlocked one.\"</p>, <p>Hands of Malady was currently the only spell I could use at that moment. I still couldn't use the other spell.</p>, <p>There were five stages to a spell.</p>, <p>Unlocking, which was the integration of a circle in the mind. Only when a circle connection was established with the mind would one be able to use the spell as wanted.</p>, <p>It was usually the hardest part of learning a spell.</p>, <p>The next five ranks were—beginner, intermediate, advanced, superior, and perfected.</p>, <p>\".....Any intermediate?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes. Sadness.\"</p>, <p>Currently, only sadness was intermediate for me.</p>, <p>It was the one I understood the best, and it was also the one that hurt the most.</p>, <p>So...</p>, <p>\"Try it on me.\"</p>, <p>I felt a little reluctant when she asked me. But I understood that this was important and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>\"Now....?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes, I need to know the extent of your skills before helping you.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Briefly, I glanced at my forearm before taking my gaze away from it.</p>, <p>I needed to evoke sadness.</p>, <p>The wheel couldn't guarantee such emotion. And...</p>, <p>'I want to see how deep my powers are.'</p>, <p>Could they affect someone as powerful as her?</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>The thought boiled in my mind and I took another deep breath before closing my eyes. I let my mind sink into my thoughts.</p>, <p>I was going to give it my all. Without the immersion. Without cheating. Just me, and my thoughts.</p>, <p>And for me to do that...</p>, <p>I needed to unseal memories I had kept hidden in my mind.</p>, <p>\"H-huu...\"</p>, <p>A certain pain pierced my heart. It stabbed at it like a sharp knife and I felt my chest tighten.</p>, <p>An image conjured in my mind.</p>, <p>My lips... They felt dry all of a sudden. My fingers felt restless, and my lungs started to heat with every breath.</p>, <p>A familiar sensation.</p>, <p>....And a familiar smell.</p>, <p>Earthy, pungent, with a touch of sweet notes.</p>, <p>Haa... This was...</p>, <p>Tzzz—</p>, <p>The sound it made with each drag.</p>, <p>The calmness it brought.</p>, <p>The taste in my lips.</p>, <p>I recalled everything. To the little detail. As if it were yesterday.</p>, <p>Even the conversation that came along with that feeling.</p>, <p>'....Why did you start smoking?'</p>, <p>Who was it that asked me that question...? My mind was fuzzy. My surroundings were gray, and the figure's face felt faint.</p>, <p>I couldn't recall much besides the conversation.</p>, <p>But even now...</p>, <p>I remembered my answer.</p>, <p>'There was a time when I wanted to get cancer.'</p>, <p>My cheeks twitched. It was as if the knife stuck in my heart twisted, forcing me to react.</p>, <p>It started to feel suffocating.</p>, <p>Like someone was strangling my neck. Squeezing as tightly as they could.</p>, <p>I couldn't recall the expression he made when I said those words. I wasn't looking at him, then. He was an afterthought. The one I was speaking to was none other than myself.</p>, <p>'.....I smoked because I wanted cancer.'</p>, <p>Each sentence pierced harder than the other.</p>, <p>Harder.</p>, <p>And deeper.</p>, <p>'So that my parents for once... would care about me.'</p>, <p>Because...</p>, <p>'They never did.'</p>, <p>It was sad.</p>, <p>'They died before that. They never...'</p>, <p>But it was the truth.</p>, <p>'...Got that chance, you know? The chance to pay attention to me as I lay on my deathbed. It's funny right?'</p>, <p>\"H-ha...\"</p>, <p>I could hardly breathe by this point.</p>, <p>The weight on my chest seemed immense.</p>, <p>I...</p>, <p>My lips trembled.</p>, <p>I persisted.</p>, <p>'The death of my parents... It never saddened me.'</p>, <p>I let the conversation flow.</p>, <p>'The only thing that saddened me was the fact that they couldn't see me suffer. Pay attention to me once.'</p>, <p>I had been smiling then.</p>, <p>The irony felt funny too much for me.</p>, <p>\"H-haa..\"</p>, <p>'I regret it now, though. I don't... want to die.'</p>, <p>Their death made me regret my actions.</p>, <p>I was eighteen then.</p>, <p>'I thought that if I stopped, my body would heal. I was young. I am young. And yet...'</p>, <p>I was still smiling.</p>, <p>'...I ended up getting cancer after I stopped. After I found reason to care.'</p>, <p>And I am still smiling now.</p>, <p>Because...</p>, <p>That's my life story.</p>, <p>My pathetic life.</p>, <p>I stopped then. I couldn't take it anymore. My mind couldn't take it. The memories... They felt too vivid... too real...</p>, <p>Light returned to my eyes.</p>, <p>Delilah appeared before me, her expression as stoic as ever. How long had passed? Probably a second or less, but it felt like an eternity to me.</p>, <p>Tears trickled down my eyes.</p>, <p>I let them.</p>, <p>And then, I spoke.</p>, <p>\".....It's strange. Emotions. I didn't think they'd hurt so much.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The silence felt stifling.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Delilah stood by the window of her office. She stared down at the campus from above, quietly staring at the moving cadets.</p>, <p>It had been ten minutes since Julien had left.</p>, <p>Even now, she was thinking about him.</p>, <p>About his 'sadness'.</p>, <p>The expression he made after she had asked, his change in expression, the tears in his eyes, the power of his voice...</p>, <p>Images of him—that moment—continued to replay in her mind.</p>, <p>She had asked out of curiosity. It was after hearing the reports about what he had done back in the classroom that she felt compelled to test.</p>, <p>Emotions were a scary tool.</p>, <p>Regardless of strength, they could affect someone. Everyone had emotions. Some were just better at hiding them than others.</p>, <p>\"It's still a bit raw.\"</p>, <p>His mastery over his emotions...</p>, <p>They weren't very refined just yet.

Or maybe I did...</p>, <p>Still...</p>, <p>\"Nothing.\"</p>, <p>There had been no reaction from Delilah when I used my skill. Even as I put everything in it, she remained expressionless and unfazed.</p>, <p>It was a bit disappointing but understandable.</p>, <p>She was the closest to the Zenith. For her to be unaffected by me didn't come to me as a surprise. Disappointing, but expected.</p>, <p>'I wonder when I will be able to affect someone like her...'</p>, <p>Emotions could affect anyone regardless of their tier and strength. That much I was aware of. Unfortunately, the stronger one was, the more powerful their mind was.</p>, <p>It became a lot harder to affect the emotions of someone like that.</p>, <p>And the fact that she seemed unguarded when I used my spell and was still unaffected spoke volumes of her mental resistance.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>The reality of my situation became more glaring to me.</p>, <p>I still had a long way to go.</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>In the two weeks that I had been at the institute, I had never really paid any particular attention to my surroundings.</p>, <p>It was with such thoughts that I looked at my surroundings for once. It was beautiful. The place looked stunning with greenery everywhere and intricately designed buildings that seemed unfit for this 'setting'.</p>, <p>Cadets walked around the campus talking with one another and enjoying their life.</p>, <p>There was also a strange scene in the distance. A middle-aged man with a thick mustache and round glasses sat by a stone stool, playing checkers alone.</p>, <p>\"What sort of...\"</p>, <p>Yes. He was alone, but...</p>, <p>He still seemed to be having fun.</p>, <p>.....I felt a little envious staring at the scene.</p>, <p>Had my circumstances been a bit different, perhaps I would've enjoyed my time here more thoroughly, but...</p>, <p>'I can't.'</p>, <p>There were things that I needed to prioritize.</p>, <p>I needed to remain consistent with my mindset.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>As I walked the campus, I suddenly paused. In the distance, a particular scene caught my attention. Four cadets were circling over a single person.</p>, <p>'It's her...'</p>, <p>I recognized her in an instant.</p>, <p>With her platinum long hair, sour expression, and red eyes, she easily stood out.</p>, <p>It was one of the top-ranked cadets.</p>, <p>Kiera Mylne.</p>, <p>'Why is she...?'</p>, <p> ***</p>, <p>\"Think about our offer. If you join us, we'll be able to have more power over the first year. You'll be able to do whatever you want... Even smoke.\"</p>, <p>The offer seemed rather tempting.</p>, <p>Smoking... Smoking...</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Yeah.</p>, <p>\"....I'll have to decline.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>\"What do you...?\"</p>, <p>Kiera rummaged through her pockets and took out a cigarette which she quickly lit up with her finger.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>She then proceeded to blow the smoke toward the four people surrounding her.</p>, <p>\"Akh!\"</p>, <p>\"What are you....!\"</p>, <p>Kiera smirked as she looked at their faces.</p>, <p>\"I can smoke regardless. The fuck do I care about joining a faction? It's bothersome.\"</p>, <p>They had been pestering for the past week or so. Something about joining their faction. Each time she refused them. However, their persistence never ceased. It was starting to get on her nerves.</p>, <p>\"If you have nothing else better to do, why don't you do something more productive like breathing water? Trust me. You'll do me a service.\"</p>, <p>The faces of the four cadets surrounding her flushed. They seemed unsure of what to say which Kiera found hilarious as she smacked her thigh.</p>, <p>\"Pfttt, you should take a look at your expressions. Fucking ridiculous.\"</p>, <p>And proceeded to laugh to herself.</p>, <p>\"Kakaka.\"</p>, <p>Only that... Her laugh wasn't the most pleasing to the ears. Eventually, though, the four cadets snapped out of it.</p>, <p>A tall cadet with blonde hair cut in a bowl cut, and sunken cheeks stepped forward. He frowned while looking at Kiera.</p>, <p>It was obvious from their body language that they were all wary of her. It was probably why they hadn't resorted to any violence or threats.</p>, <p>\".....I'll ask again, do you want to join our faction or not? It will be very beneficial for you in the long run. We'll make you the Vice-Leader if you want to. Anders is adamant about wanting you in our group.

Fuck off.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>The cadet opened his mouth and then closed it as his teeth ground together.</p>, <p>\"Do yo—\"</p>, <p>\"You there.\"</p>, <p>A cold voice pierced through the surroundings as all heads turned.</p>, <p>\"Who...!\"</p>, <p>The expressions of all present stiffened at the sight of the figure headed their way. A mere glance into his eyes compelled them to avert their gaze, finding the intensity within them too overwhelming.</p>, <p>With his well-maintained uniform and intimidating expression, the four cadets struggled to keep themselves composed.</p>, <p>He was someone an enigma and someone nobody wanted to associate with.</p>, <p>Tok.</p>, <p>He stood tall in front of the cadet. His gaze lowered to meet his eyes.</p>, <p>\"....Are you the ones I've been hearing about?\"</p>, <p>Even his voice sounded intimidating.</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>\"That faction thing.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>The cadet secretly gulped. He found it hard to remain composed under Julien's intense gaze.</p>, <p>He was still able to force a small nod.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\".....I see.\"</p>, <p>Julien calmly closed his eyes before muttering.</p>, <p>\"Your leader, or whoever is in charge...\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>All four cadets looked at Julien with wide-open eyes. He cared nothing for the gaze as he flatly continued.</p>, <p>\"Get him to meet me tomorrow.\"</p>, <p>His words...</p>, <p>They seemed more like a command than a request.</p>, <p>\"I'll talk with him tomorrow.\"</p>, <p>It was as if they had no right to refuse. And it was the intensity at which he looked at them that made them unable to refute. Forcing them to quietly nod before leaving.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Only once they left did silence fall on the surroundings.</p>, <p>Kiera, who had been watching the entire time, frowned and blew her smoke away.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>\"What was that for? Were you trying to help me or something?\"</p>, <p>Julien turned his head and their eyes met.</p>, <p>'It's that expression again...'</p>, <p>The one filled with nothing but pity as he looked at her. Kiera silently clenched her teeth. Why are you looking at me like that...? Just as she was about to say something, he beat her to it.</p>, <p>\"I didn't do it for you.\"</p>, <p>Julien said, his voice sounding rather quiet.</p>, <p>\".....I'm just taking responsibility for once. I'd rather handle it now than wait before it gets harder to handle.\"</p>, <p>He glanced at her once again, his eyes falling on the cigarette in her hand.</p>, <p>Kiera frowned, expecting him to do something similar to last time.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>But....</p>, <p>\"Stop smoking.\"</p>, <p>Much to her surprise, he didn't pursue the matter and turned around to leave.</p>, <p>\".....It isn't good for you.\"</p>, <p>His back slowly faded from her sight.</p>, <p>Staring at it, Kiera looked at her hand where the cigarette was and mumbled,</p>, <p>\"You think I don't know?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was nighttime by the time Aoife was done with her outing at the library. She normally wouldn't have spent such a long time there, but thinking back at the situation from before, she had no choice but to stay there.</p>, <p>.....Had she left in her previous mood, she was afraid she'd kill someone by accident.</p>, <p>The moon hung in the night sky, illuminating the world beneath.</p>, <p>Lost in her thoughts, Aoife followed the path back to the dorm. It was a beautiful path.</p>, <p>The cobblestone path was embraced by all sorts of flowers as a gentle breeze gracefully swept through the air.</p>, <p>It felt strangely nice.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>And then, a figure appeared in the distance. They seemed to be all sweaty, and haggard.</p>, <p>\"Leon...?\"</p>, <p>His identity became clear as he stopped under the light from a lampost. How could it not when his appearance stood out so much?</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>He turned his head, finally noticing her.</p>, <p>\"Aoife?\"</p>, <p>\"....Are you coming back from training?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded his head. Then, lowering his head and focusing his gaze on the books in her hand, he tilted his head.</p>, <p>\"Library?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>\"So late?\"</p>, <p>\"Could ask the same of you.\"</p>, <p>\"Right...\"</p>, <p>Leon scratched the side of his head. Glancing at the books, he hesitantly asked.</p>, <p>\"Do you need help?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>A flat-out refusal.</p>, <p>\"I can carry this much.\"</p>, <p>They were only like, one... two... three.... eight books?</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Though he didn't show it with his face, he seemed a little doubtful. But he still relented and wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p>, <p>Aoife quietly picked up her pace to catch up to him, when...</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>One of the books fell due to her carelessness. Or more like, she was just not paying attention. With her reflexes, she could've easily avoided such a situation.</p>, <p>\"I'll get it.\"</p>, <p>Leon offered to help and bent down to pick up the book.</p>, <p>\"An English book...?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? Ah, yes...\"</p>, <p>It was one of the books that Julien had left on his desk. She was curious about it. For him to be so good at English, surely there must've been reason. Therefore, after thinking about it, she decided to pick up that book.</p>, <p>Though she didn't particularly like him, she had to admit that he was competent. Her goal was to become the best.</p>, <p>Therefore, she needed to pick up things from the best.</p>, <p>\"Tough language.\"</p>, <p>Leon casually glanced at the cover of the book, his eyes squinting slightly as he tried to decipher the meaning of the title. Only for his entire body to freeze the next second.</p>, <p>\"Leon...?</p>, <p>Noticing a change in his demeanor, Aoife cocked her head. What's wrong with him?</p>, <p>\"....Where did you get this?\"</p>, <p>His voice came out even. Strangely so.</p>, <p>\"Where did I get this? I got it from the library...\"</p>, <p>\"Oh. I see.\"</p>, <p>He nodded calmly.</p>, <p>Then, he handed it back to her.</p>, <p>\"Burn it.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Was this a joke?</p>, <p>Aoife thought so at first, but when she looked at his face, she couldn't help but be taken aback.</p>, <p>He seemed serious. Almost desperate.</p>, <p>\"Just...\"</p>, <p>His eyes trembled. He seemed shaken.</p>, <p>The stupefied Aoife narrowed her eyes and carefully looked at Leon.</p>, <p>'What is....'</p>, <p>\".....Don't ever give this to Julien.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>Yet again, Aoife was taken aback.</p>, <p>But I got it from him...</p>, <p>\"Never.\"</p>, <p>He made sure to emphasize before excusing himself, leaving her standing dumbly. As he left, she ended up overhearing his mutters, 'Cursed book...'</p>, <p>\"What kind of situation is this...?\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned and finally paid attention to the book. She hadn't paid attention to the title before since she just took it for the sake of it, but now she was intrigued.</p>, <p>Just what kind of book could get Leon so shaken up?</p>, <p>Her eyes squinted as she translated the title.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Soon, the title became clear to her.

Well... was.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, I had Leon with me as he gave me a brief rundown of the situation while he whispered near my ear.</p>, <p>\"Was...?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah, he sustained an injury a few years back. He hasn't been the same since. His power dropped a lot too.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I looked back at that man who stood at the front. He seemed like an extremely warm person at first glance. Like a neighborhood uncle who everyone was friendly with.</p>, <p>\"Haha, it seems like everyone is already aware of my identity.\"</p>, <p>Even his laugh was warm.</p>, <p>\"Please don't worry about my appearance. I'm only here to observe several cadets. As you are all aware, the draft will be coming at the end of the year. I want to make sure that we select the best of the best.\"</p>, <p>Draft...?</p>, <p>A new term I was unfamiliar with entered my mind.</p>, <p>I thought about asking Leon but chose against it given that he was currently speaking. I made a mental note in my mind.</p>, <p>\".....So, while this is indeed just a regular class, I'll be here to monitor you guys and observe your performance. Don't feel too concerned. This won't be the only class I'll monitor, so please feel free to go at your own pace.\"</p>, <p>He then went on to ramble about the same thing for the next few minutes before finishing.</p>, <p>\"I have taken enough of your time. Please go on your way to do your thing.\"</p>, <p>Clap. Clap. Clap!</p>, <p>The cadets began to clap.</p>, <p>I did too.</p>, <p>He returned our claps with a slight bow as Professor Wallace stepped ahead.</p>, <p>\"You've heard him. Don't feel too pressured. There will be many chances for you to prove yourself.\"</p>, <p>She proceeded to clap her hands and I felt my body levitate all of a sudden.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? What's go—\"</p>, <p>Clap—!</p>, <p>\"Have a nice trip~\"</p>, <p>Those were the last words I heard before the world turned dark.</p>, <p>Thud...!</p>, <p>Light only returned after I felt my feet touch against something hard, and even then, the light was just minimal.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>When I looked around, I realized.</p>, <p>I was in the middle of the forest. Alone.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Right as the students were teleported, Professor Wallace turned to address Professor Bucklam.</p>, <p>\"Has anyone caught your eye?\"</p>, <p>\"....A few.\"</p>, <p>The Professor replied with a thin smile. Leaning slightly on his cane, he stared into the forest as his eyes squinted.</p>, <p>\"Aoife, Leon, Kiera, Julien, Evelyn, Luxon, Anders... There's a lot of interesting cadets.\"</p>, <p>\"There's indeed quite a lot of talented individuals this year. More than the previous years.\"</p>, <p>\"Haha, yes. The draft is going to be quite difficult this year.\"</p>, <p>\"But isn't that a good thing?\"</p>, <p>\"Of course it is. The more competition, the better the final candidates.\"</p>, <p>\"Indeed.\"</p>, <p>Professor Wallance nodded in understanding. The Draft was an important event for the Academy. It was an event that happened at the end of the year and only the top cadets were eligible for the honor.</p>, <p>But even that was just the start.</p>, <p>There were further steps down the line that the cadets needed to follow after becoming eligible.</p>, <p>And it was the 'scout's' job to make sure the selected members were good enough to pass such steps.</p>, <p>Professor Backlam was one such scout.</p>, <p>\"...I guess it's time for me to do my job.\"</p>, <p>Lowering his head slightly, Professor Bucklam smiled. Then, without turning back, he calmly headed toward the forest, his figure disappearing into its depths.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Candice remained standing where she was for several minutes. Her mind wandered back to his back.</p>, <p>Though he seemed warm and kind, all Candice could see was loneliness.</p>, <p>It was to be expected given his situation.</p>, <p>He had once been so brilliant, and yet...</p>, <p>She pursed her lips and shook her head.</p>, <p>\"A pity. If only he didn't... Haa...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was dark and humid. My clothes clung to my skin, and the smell of my sweat permeated around. I was uncomfortable, but this much I could handle. There had been times in my previous life when I had been subjected to worse conditions at my job.</p>, <p>'Fucking bastards...'</p>, <p>The thought still irritated me to this day.</p>, <p>In any case...</p>, <p>I took out the guidebook from my bag and stared at its contents.</p>, <p>: Find water source — 1P</p>, <p>: Find food source — 1P</p>, <p>: Create shelter — 4 P</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>In short.</p>, <p>\"Survive for a day.\"</p>, <p>With each objective achieved, one would earn points. The one who had the most points by the end would be ranked first. Because of my obvious disability, my results didn't matter as much.</p>, <p>That said, just because the results didn't matter as much, it didn't mean that I wasn't planning on trying.</p>, <p>\"Hoooo...\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I dropped the backpack down and prepared to get my camp ready.</p>, <p>I felt energized and ready.</p>, <p>Although I wasn't in top shape, it didn't mean I couldn't do this.</p>, <p>Such was how I felt.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'Uh...?'</p>, <p>Reality seemed to hate me.</p>, <p>Just as I was about to get ready to start, the world turned black. When light returned, I found myself back in the forest, but at an entirely different place.</p>, <p>Clank....!</p>, <p>Sparks flew in the air and the nearby vegetation shattered.</p>, <p>'What's going on?'</p>, <p>My voice refused to come out of my mouth. As if it were trapped in my mind. And it was then that I understood what was happening.</p>, <p>This familiar feeling...</p>, <p>The vivid sensations but the weird strange of entrapment...</p>, <p>'Vision.'</p>, <p>I was experiencing another vision.</p>, <p>'Shit...'</p>, <p>I wanted to curse. Of all times now...? No, when had it really had good timing? They always came randomly, and when I least expected them.</p>, <p>I once again wanted to curse at my situation, but I knew I couldn't.</p>, <p>The vision, though random, always ended up pointing out important events.</p>, <p>'Perhaps, major or minor events from the game...'</p>, <p>I wasn't aware since I had never played the game. But that wasn't currently important.</p>, <p>Booom!</p>, <p>Several trees shattered, their remains flying in all sorts of directions. A figure gradually appeared, lying down on the ground with a pained expression.</p>, <p>\"Ugh...\"</p>, <p>It was a familiar face.</p>, <p>Long white hair, deep red eyes...</p>, <p>'Kiera?'</p>, <p>Was this vision about-</p>, <p>\"Kh...! Shit.\"</p>, <p>Kiera forced herself up as blood dripped down from her mouth. Her expression almost seemed desperate. No, she really was...</p>, <p>\"H-how... Why...?\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened as she suddenly screamed.</p>, <p>\"Wait...! No!!\"</p>, <p>Booom!</p>, <p>Several more trees shattered as a huge explosion resounded. A gale rushed from the front as my ears rang.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>Something heavy fell right next to where I stood.</p>, <p>I couldn't see at first due to the dust, but when it all cleared...</p>, <p>'....!'</p>, <p>I stood rigid on the spot.</p>, <p>My heart tightened and my face stiffened. An array of different emotions coursed through my mind in that moment as I struggled to understand what I was seeing.</p>, <p>'This...'</p>, <p>I looked down at the familiar face.</p>, <p>The supposed main character. The strongest first year, and my knight...</p>, <p>'...How?'</p>, <p>His body lay next to my feet.</p>, <p>'Dead.'</p>]\n",

I thought I was standing there, reliving the moment, and that this wasn't a vision.</p>, <p>'How...?'</p>, <p>I struggled to comprehend the sight in front of me.</p>, <p>How could Leon have died...?

Haaa....\"</p>, <p>Sweat trickled down the side of my face as my breath left my body.</p>, <p>Ba... Thump! Ba... Thump!</p>, <p>I could hear the sound of my own heartbeat in my mind as I tried to recover from the shock of the vision.</p>, <p>\"Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My head felt light and the world blurry.</p>, <p>But in spite of that, I had no choice but to recover fast.</p>, <p>\"F... haaa... fucking shit.\"</p>, <p>A curse slipped my mouth and I ruffled my head.</p>, <p>'Now of all the fucking times...'</p>, <p>Just what sort of situation was this...?

At the very least, I refused to believe that to be the case. It certainly had something to do with the situation.</p>, <p>But yet again...</p>, <p>It brought a new question to my mind.</p>, <p>\"Why is the institute not aware of this?\"</p>, <p>Was this perhaps another one of their tests...?</p>, <p>\"No, it's not.\"</p>, <p>I could still recall Leon's lifeless expression as he fell by my feet.

I was at a loss as to what to do. The figure was a lot stronger than me. To be able to kill Leon, a Tier 2 knight... It had to be at least Tier 3 in strength.</p>, <p>The higher the tier, the faster, and more efficient they were with controlling mana and utilizing spells.</p>, <p>I was merely at Tier 1.</p>, <p>How was I supposed to do anything about the figure...?</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Damn it.\"</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth and grabbed my backpack.</p>, <p>I had no choice but to do something.</p>, <p>Leon couldn't die.</p>, <p>If he died...</p>, <p>I was screwed.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A strange silence gripped the surroundings as Leon carefully scanned the landscape.</p>, <p>There was something about the environment that felt...</p>, <p>Unsettling.</p>, <p>SHIIIIING----!</p>, <p>He unsheathed his sword and narrowed his eyes. A grave expression marred his features.</p>, <p>All humans were born with a [Innate] skill. Though the Academy didn't require one to share what it was, a few cadets with lower talents tended to expose it in hopes of getting accepted.</p>, <p>Leon's [Innate] skill was called [Instinct].</p>, <p>It was an innate skill that granted him the ability to feel when things weren't right.</p>, <p>It was for this exact reason that he was sure that the current 'Julien' was a fake, and that he hadn't been lying about his circumstances back then.</p>, <p>....And it was also for this exact reason that he was hesitant about fighting him.</p>, <p>His instincts...</p>, <p>They told him to not fight him.</p>, <p>That he wasn't someone that he could easily take on.</p>, <p>\"Huuuu...\"</p>, <p>There were hardly any times when his instincts had been wrong. There were occasions where they had been, but those times were rare and he always liked to play things safe. And it also wasn't like it was active at all times.</p>, <p>There were many times his instincts didn't detect anything. But in the rare times that they did... He always made sure to be ready.</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>Scanning around once more, he secretly started to run the mana in his body.</p>, <p>As a Tier 2 knight, his senses were rather sharp. Within moments, he felt every little detail of his surroundings.</p>, <p>From the speed of the wind to the number of grass stalks around him.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>It was also because of this that he was able to react in time, suddenly shifting his body by pivoting his foot and positioning the blade in front of him.</p>, <p>Bang--!</p>, <p>Sparks flew in the air as Leon felt his body skid several meters back before stopping.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>A groan inevitably escaped from his lips as he felt his chest cave slightly. The power of that strike...</p>, <p>It wasn't something he would've been able to take on unguarded.</p>, <p>Whoever this enemy was...</p>, <p>They were without a doubt stronger than him.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>Leon felt his body tense as the nearby bushes rustled and a figure gradually became clear for him to see.</p>, <p>When the figure became clear, Leon's eyes widened and his expression cracked.</p>, <p>\"It's you...?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"What am I supposed to do...?\"</p>, <p>I was lost. I had no idea where to start. The forest was massive, and finding Leon was easier said than done.</p>, <p>The only thing that I knew was the exact details of the location.</p>, <p>I remembered almost every little detail about the space.</p>, <p>But that was it...</p>, <p>Where exactly it was, I wasn't sure. Even the map in my hand was of no use.</p>, <p>'Crap...'</p>, <p>By now he had most likely already met the enemy. For how long could he last? A minute? Two minutes? Ten minutes...?</p>, <p>The idea ate at my mind as I continued forward. I had no choice but to move. Leon couldn't die... His death would mean that the likelihood of me getting exposed as a 'fraud' was almost guaranteed.</p>, <p>What then...?</p>, <p>Go into hiding and wait for the world to forget about me? Even if that was possible, that wasn't what I wanted.</p>, <p>I had a clear goal in mind.</p>, <p>And Leon was the key piece to helping me achieve that goal.</p>, <p>....I couldn't do without him.</p>, <p>\"He can't die...\"</p>, <p>I reminded myself of the fact.</p>, <p>He couldn't die.</p>, <p>\"Haaa.... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>I had been running for a few minutes, when...</p>, <p>Rustle--</p>, <p>The bushes near me rustled and a voice followed suit.</p>, <p>\"Found you.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Tsk.....\"</p>, <p>Kiera clicked her tongue as she looked around.

A sense of emptiness spread across her chest as her left eye twitched.</p>, <p>\"Shit...\"</p>, <p>Why did people smoke....? Each person had their own answer to the question.</p>, <p>Kiera's answer was...</p>, <p>'It's warm.'</p>, <p>Her lungs would heat up, her mind would relax, and she'd forget that she wasn't alone for a moment.</p>, <p>It was the gruesome reality of her life.</p>, <p>She was alone.</p>, <p>The people she called 'family' only cared about prestige and honor. It was for this reason that despite being one herself, she hated nobles.</p>, <p>She also hated the dark.</p>, <p>It felt stifling.</p>, <p>It was her curse. She didn't even know why she was like it. It had been like this for as long as she could remember. But it had haunted her for as long as she could remember.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that she smoked.</p>, <p>To her...</p>, <p>Smoking was her medicine.</p>, <p>It brought warmth.</p>, <p>Ziiiip--</p>, <p>Kiera unzipped her bag where she took out a pack of cigarettes.</p>, <p>[Milton's Rose]</p>, <p>The familiar box, and the the familiar smell. Briefly, it eased the darkness that surrounded her.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>An orange light flickered in the dark as Kiera took a drag of the cigarette.</p>, <p>Her lungs burned with an all too familiar sensation, and her mind calmed down. But she soon frowned.</p>, <p>\"....Looks like I need to change the intensity.\"</p>, <p>Cigarettes had different intensities. Mainly because superhumans that were capable of wielding mana had certain resistance to the chemicals in normal cigarettes.</p>, <p>It was hence why the cigarettes that Kiera was using were specifically designed for superhumans.</p>, <p>While normal cigarettes couldn't harm them, these ones could....</p>, <p>The higher the Tier she reached, the more intense the cigarette had to be for her to feel anything.</p>, <p>It was also because of this that the damage from smoking couldn't be healed.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>But it wasn't like she cared.</p>, <p>Closing her eyes, she leaned against a nearby tree and savored the taste of the cigarette.</p>, <p>Her mind relaxed and all her worries disappeared.</p>, <p>By the time she was done, her mind was clear. The dark didn't seem as intimidating as it had been moments prior.</p>, <p>Her body felt warm.</p>, <p>\"Let's get this shit done.\"</p>, <p>She tossed the pack back into her bag and took out the booklet for the task.</p>, <p>Flip--!</p>, <p>She had just opened the first page when...</p>, <p>--------!</p>, <p>A resounding roar reverberated. At the same time, the ground beneath her quaked, and the nearby trees shattered.</p>, <p>Her body's equilibrium shifted, leaving her with no time to respond.</p>, <p>\"...Huh?\"</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>A figure skidded back, only stopping after impaling their sword against the ground.</p>, <p>Kiera's eyes widened at the sight of him.</p>, <p>And her mouth opened to mumble,</p>, <p>\"Leon...?\"</p>]\n",

But that didn't mean I'd have to throw my life away to help him.</p>, <p>If the situation seemed impossible then...</p>, <p>\"Huuu\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes.</p>, <p>'....Let's see when I get there.'</p>, <p>The current plan was to interfere when most opportune. Given that at some point Leon managed to injure the enemy, an opening certainly existed.</p>, <p>I planned on exploiting it.</p>, <p>Opening my eyes again, I slowed down my pace.</p>, <p>\"Stop.\"</p>, <p>Anders similarly stopped as he turned to look at me. I placed my finger on my lips before he could say anything and whispered.</p>, <p>\"Keep your voice down from this moment forth.\"</p>, <p>\"...?\"</p>, <p>He seemed confused as he looked around him and squinted. But after an internal debate, he relented and nodded.</p>, <p>\"....Fine.\"</p>, <p>'Now that I look at him, he seems quite reasonable...'</p>, <p>It took me no time to realize who he was. Back then, I had been so immersed in my emotions that I hadn't paid proper attention to how he looked. However, his face was now clear to me and the situation was rather funny.</p>, <p>Who'd have thought I'd end up working with the same person that I used to prove my worth in the middle of the lecture?</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>I quietly led him forward. The surroundings were the same as I remembered. From the trees to the smell that lingered in the air.</p>, <p>If there was one good thing about the visions, it was that I could remember every single detail with perfect memory...</p>, <p>It was thanks to that that I was able to find the location rather quickly.</p>, <p>\"This is it.\"</p>, <p>The exact same spot where Leon died.</p>, <p>It was where I was currently standing.</p>, <p>'They aren't here yet which means that I'm still early.'</p>, <p>I sighed in relief at the idea and looked around me. Only to see Anders looking at me in confusion. I could guess exactly what he was thinking from his expression.</p>, <p>\"Use your abilities. See if there's anyone near us.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...? Why-\"</p>, <p>\"Do it.\"</p>, <p>He frowned but nonetheless listened. Was he afraid of me, or were the circumstances making him act this way?</p>, <p>In a way, I could see how he had become the leader of the nobles.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>His eyes quickly widened a few moments after he closed them and his gaze turned to look to the right where he pointed.</p>, <p>\"Over there...\"</p>, <p>I followed the direction of where he pointed as he continued, his voice trembling slightly.</p>, <p>\"There are multiple people. A large conflict—uh, wait!\"</p>, <p>Though he tried to stop me, I was already moving. The situation was still not bad. Since Leon could deal some damage to the opponent if I played my cards right...</p>, <p>\"Uhm?\"</p>, <p>My eyebrow twitched as I felt a sharp pain in my arm. It hurt so much that I had to stop for a brief moment. What sort of... I turned my wrist over to see what was going on when my eyes shot up.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>The second leaf.</p>, <p>The one that I was unsure of what it did.</p>, <p>It was shining brightly.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>\"Uekh...!\"</p>, <p>Leon felt his back crash against a nearby tree as he felt himself lose his breath.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>He landed on the ground, only keeping himself from falling thanks to his sword which he used to support himself.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>With uneven breathing, he looked up. Even now, he struggled to understand. How...? How was it possible?</p>, <p>\"The fuck is this? Aren't you supposed to be our Professor?\"</p>, <p>Kiera's startled voice echoed from his left as she held her hand forward. A red magic circle floated at the tips of her fingers.</p>, <p>Swoosh!</p>, <p>Flames surged from all around her, enveloping her entire body as amidst the inferno, her eyes, reminiscent of rubies, gleamed brightly, piercing through the raging blaze surrounding her.</p>, <p>Thrusting her hand forward, the flames enveloping her body twisted and coiled like a serpent before surging forward where a figure stood.</p>, <p>Unfortunately...</p>, <p>!</p>, <p>The flames, which had been raging with a lot of intensity, were quickly put out with a single swipe of a cane.</p>, <p>Kiera's expression changed drastically at this, but before she could do anything...</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>Her body was flung several meters back, crashing against the dirt as she skidded back several meters.</p>, <p>\"Uhk...\"</p>, <p>Her groaned reached Leon as he tightly held on the sword in his hand and stared ahead.</p>, <p>Indeed. They were severely outclassed. But how could they not be when their opponent was a Tier 3 opponent? Although the two of them were both Tier 2, their powers were still outstripped.</p>, <p>It took more than two Tier 2 individuals to get rid of someone of that caliber.</p>, <p>And to make matters worse, this was no regular opponent...</p>, <p>'Professor Bucklam.'</p>, <p>Even now, Leon didn't fully understand the situation. How could it be him? Was this a test, or was this real?</p>, <p>At first, he thought it was, but his 'instincts' told him otherwise.</p>, <p>That was when it became clear to him.</p>, <p>Professor Bucklam. For whatever reason... He was trying to kill them.</p>, <p>No, him.</p>, <p>Why?</p>, <p>Leon wasn't sure, but...</p>, <p>\"Ukh.\"</p>, <p>He didn't have the time to care. Pressing his foot against the ground, he propelled his body forward.</p>, <p>Within moments, he arrived a few inches away from the Professor's body as he swung his blade.</p>, <p>It curved in the air and directly aimed at the Professor's exposed neck.</p>, <p>Everything was fluent. From the precision of his attack to its speed.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>His sword bounced back the moment it came down and a large translucent sphere formed around the professor's body. [Mana Sphere] an intermediate-ranked spell that provided a mage with great defense.</p>, <p>It covered his entire body and flickered the moment it came into contact with Leon's sword.</p>, <p>But that was it.</p>, <p>The force behind Leon's sword wasn't powerful enough to break it, leaving Leon exposed to a counterattack.</p>, <p>Swoosh!</p>, <p>Professor Bucklam took advantage of that moment as his cane came slashing down on Leon who just barely managed to avoid it by twisting his body in the air.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>Falling down, Leon pushed his body forward again and swung his sword.</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>Regardless of...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>What he did...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>The shield surrounding the professor refused to budge.</p>, <p>\"Haaa.... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>Leon felt his breath grow heavy with each attempt. It wasn't just him.</p>, <p>Swoosh!</p>, <p>A fire directed itself toward the Professor, but even that was of no use as it simply scattered the moment it touched it.</p>, <p>\"What kind of fucking shield is this?\"</p>, <p>Leon could hear Kiera's curse from behind as she channeled another spell. Thinking about something, Leon bit his lips before bringing his body forward to slash at the shield.</p>, <p>Professor Bucklam prepared to receive Leon when his figure faded and disappeared.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>By the time Leon's touched the ground, he was standing behind Kiera who looked startled by the sight of him.</p>, <p>\"Holy fuck! What are you doing?...That scared the shit out of me.\"</p>, <p>\"Hold him back for me.\"</p>, <p>A white glow formed over Leon's sword. Its aura intensifying by the second.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>Kiera was startled at first, but realizing what Leon was trying to do, she bit her lips and nodded.</p>, <p>\"Fuck... Whatever, do it.\"</p>, <p>The flames around her body intensified and the temperature around them rose to an alarming degree.</p>, <p>They were so intense that the surrounding grass and trees started to catch fire.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Kiera's breath started to grow heavy, but gritting her teeth, she pushed her hand forward, and the fire around her split into several threads which all rushed toward the professor who frowned and slashed with his cane.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, as if they had a mind of their own, the threads diverged, encircling him before adhering to the ground and forming a cage</p>, <p>\"N-now...!\"</p>, <p>Kiera shouted as she looked behind her where a powerful glow appeared.</p>, <p>An intense mana wave wafted through the air as Leon's sword shone with a majestic light. He didn't hesitate to move the moment she spoke.</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>The ground caved as his body zoomed toward the professor.</p>, <p>\"Khuek...!\"</p>, <p>An intense pain invaded every part of his body as he rushed forward. His muscles were tearing apart, and his mana was running dangerously low.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>He had no choice.</p>, <p>This was do or die.</p>, <p>Bang!</p>, <p>His foot pressed against the ground, stopping his body just as he neared the professor who appeared somewhat alarmed.</p>, <p>\"Ukh!\"</p>, <p>Pain once again invaded Leon's body as he felt the muscles of his core snap, but he still persisted.</p>, <p>Using everything he had, he swung diagonally in an upward motion.</p>, <p>Booom!</p>, <p>His blade clashed against the professor's shield as it flickered intensively. Unlike before, the flickering was even more pronounced, and just barely, Leon could see cracks form on its surface.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>That wasn't enough.</p>, <p>The shield was still standing.</p>, <p>\"Kh...!!!\"</p>, <p>He clenched his teeth with even more force as he pushed all the remaining mana in his body out and into the sword.</p>, <p>Cr-Crack...!</p>, <p>The cracks around the shield widened. But... It was still not enough.</p>, <p>'Not yet...!'</p>, <p>His lungs were on fire and every part of his body ached. Leon could hardly keep himself standing as he felt his knee buckle.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Kh...!\"</p>, <p>He had to persist.</p>, <p>Not. Until. He. Reached. His. Goal.</p>, <p>\"Akh...!\"</p>, <p>His sword shone with even fiercer light. It blinded everything that was in sight. Power gushed out from it as the shield around the professor's body creaked under intense stress.</p>, <p>Rather quickly, the cracks started to widen and it was only a matter of time before the shield shattered.</p>, <p>\"Kh!\"</p>, <p>Leon kept pushing.</p>, <p>He used everything that he had to attack in that moment.</p>, <p>But the more he continued, the more he felt his heart drop...</p>, <p>'....It won't be enough.'</p>, <p>It started to become clear to me.</p>, <p>Even if the shield broke, the power behind the sword wouldn't be enough. If things went on like this then...</p>, <p>And then it happened.</p>, <p>Swoosh.</p>, <p>Purple hands sprouted from the ground beneath the professor. They came so abruptly that Professor Bucklam wasn't able to react on time and they latched onto his ankles.</p>, <p>That was all it took...</p>, <p>Crash—!</p>, <p>The shield shattered and Leon finally saw his sword slash down.</p>, <p>Pffttt!</p>, <p>Blood splattered in the air as he felt it make contact with the professor's body.</p>, <p>Clank. Clank.</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>Leon dropped to his knees as the sword scattered on the ground. A strange hung in the air as Leon felt the muscles of his body give up on him.</p>, <p>\"....Did I?\"</p>, <p>But..</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>When he looked up to see, much to Leon's horror, he could still see the Professor standing before him.</p>, <p>A large gaping wound appeared on his body, but his eyes still seemed alive. And they were.</p>, <p>He didn't even seem to care about what was going on around him. The Professor's eyes were fixed on him. As if he was the only thing on his mind.</p>, <p>His hand slowly raised and a magic circle formed.</p>, <p>It was aimed directly at the incapacitated Leon who could do nothing but watch.</p>, <p>No, this...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Just when Leon's eyes despaired, a hand reached out and grasped the Professor by the shoulder.</p>, <p>A pair of familiar hazel eyes met Leon's gaze as a dry voice echoed in the air.</p>, <p>\".....You did not.\"</p>]\n",

Of course, this is just a hunch of mine.\"</p>, <p>He lowered his body to stand at eye level with Robert who refused to meet his gaze.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"Not much of a talker...?\"</p>, <p>The Inquisitor smiled, and a sizzling sound echoed as he pressed the cigarette against the ground.</p>, <p>Tzzzz—</p>, <p>\"That's fine by me.\"</p>, <p>He pressed his hand against his face and a white glow enveloped his hand.</p>, <p>\".....This might hurt a little.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>[At around 3 P.M. today, Professor Bucklam, a renowned professor of the prestigious Haven Academy went rogue attacking one of the students. The reasoning behind his actions has yet to be determined but an investigation is ongoing.]</p>, <p>One of the Haven staff in charge of the Institute's 'public image' commented through a speaker. Several reporters stood a few feet before the podium, holding what seemed to be cameras.</p>, <p>Click. Click. Click.</p>, <p>Their shutters flashed blinding my sight.</p>, <p>'I can't believe they have cameras in this type of setting. They look a little old, but...'</p>, <p> I wanted to admire them more but the situation didn't allow me.</p>, <p>\"Cadet! Cadet! Would you like to leave a statement?\"</p>, <p>\"Cadet! Please let us know what happened. Why did he attack you? And how did you manage to defeat him \"</p>, <p>\"Please leave a statement.\"</p>, <p>Even in this world, reporters were annoying. Not that I knew given that I had never experienced it myself, but from what I had seen enough, it was probably the case.</p>, <p>[The cadets will not be answering the questions now.]</p>, <p>The reporter's attempts at asking us questions were quickly shot down by the staff who went on to announce.</p>, <p>[We're here to award the four cadets standing before us for their achievements. Not only were they able to neutralize the threat, but they did so in such a manner that prevented other cadets from getting injured.]</p>, <p>I sat at the center of the stage alongside Leon, Kiera, and Anders. We were all forced to be here to receive our 'medals' for our exemplary performance.</p>, <p>It was something that the Academy was very adamant about.</p>, <p>\".....What a pain.\"</p>, <p>I thought I had muttered those words quietly, but Kiera managed to pick up my voice.</p>, <p>\"Tell me about it.\"</p>, <p>I silently looked at her in surprise.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\"....Nothing.\"</p>, <p>\"No, fuck. You can't just say nothing when you look at me like that.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"Oy.\"</p>, <p>\"Stop. People are watching.\"</p>, <p>Leon interrupted all of a sudden. Kiera was about to speak when she closed her mouth and grunted.</p>, <p>\"Fine.\"</p>, <p>She shot me a glare in the meantime. But I chose to ignore it. She was thinking too much. I thought the situation would end there when...</p>, <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>, <p>I heard Leon's soft voice from beside me. I was surprised for a brief moment but then closed my eyes and leaned back.</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>\".....I only saved you because I could.\"</p>, <p>\"I know.\"</p>, <p>At least he knew.</p>, <p>'I wonder if it was the right decision.'</p>, <p>The decision to save him stemmed from the fact that he was the key person to help me achieve my goal. But at the same time...</p>, <p>'He's the same person that kills me in the vision.'</p>, <p>Indeed, I had potentially saved my killer.</p>, <p>'Killers...'</p>, <p>Kiera was there too.</p>, <p>\"Heh.\"</p>, <p>I found the situation funny. But at the same time, I didn't think too much of it. The visions could change. They weren't set in stone.</p>, <p>Perhaps, in the near future, a situation such as that would indeed happen, but...</p>, <p>'I know it will happen.'</p>, <p>Since I knew it, I could prepare for it.</p>, <p>\"Still, thank you.\"</p>, <p>\"Um.\"</p>, <p>I quietly nodded before opening my eyes again. My gaze eventually fell on my forearm. More specifically, toward the second tattoo.</p>, <p>It had stumped me for the past few days with no reaction whenever I pressed it. I thought that perhaps there was something wrong with it, but recalling the events of last night, I now understood.</p>, <p>'.....It makes me relive someone's most private memories. Another emotion related ability.'</p>, <p>Both my abilities were. No, rather than being abilities, they were more like a medium for me to improve in my understatement of emotions.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>The thought made me sigh.</p>, <p>This was a direct path to insanity. I could feel it.</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>Suddenly, a powerful presence appeared in the distance.</p>, <p>\"S-she's here.\"</p>, <p>Click. Click. Click.</p>, <p>Finally, the flashes were directed away from me for once.</p>, <p>When I looked in the distance, a familiar figure appeared. As the Chancellor, it was her duty to assign to us our medals.</p>, <p>Her flowing black hair curved slightly, swaying with each step she took.</p>, <p>Her extraordinary presence exuded regality that went beyond mere perception. With each step she took, a subtle ripple of magical energy, akin to a gentle breeze, flowed around her.</p>, <p>Her innate power had ascended to a level beyond what I could imagine.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Looking around the room with her piercing eyes, Delilah walked up to the stage.</p>, <p>Without paying a single ounce of attention to the reporters, she gracefully made her way toward the podium. Someone then ran up to her and handed her a short list. She quickly glanced at it before passing it back and nodding her head.</p>, <p>[We will now begin the ceremony.]</p>, <p>The announcer stated.</p>, <p>[Our Chancellor will have the honor of providing the cadets with their medals.]</p>, <p>It was pretty straightforward from there. Under the watchful eyes of the reporters and staff, I stood up and walked up to the podium.</p>, <p>We had been instructed beforehand so we knew exactly what we needed to do. From what order to move, and what to say when receiving the award.</p>, <p>I was the first to walk up.</p>, <p>Delilah stared at me with her usual blank look.</p>, <p>\".....You did well. The Institute is grateful for what you've done.\"</p>, <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>, <p>On closer look, she didn't seem to be really comfortable.</p>, <p>I guess she wasn't comfortable with this type of thing.</p>, <p>\"Come closer, I will put the medal on you.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>I did as I was told and leaned my head closer. In the moment when I leaned forward, I heard a soft whisper in my ear.</p>, <p>Feeling her breath on my ear, I shuddered at first.</p>, <p>Then, as I processed her words, my brow jumped up and I had to force myself from making any rash movement.</p>, <p>'Seriously...?'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>The doors of the cell closed and Inquisitor Hallowe came out. His rough steps echoed across the dark corridor as he took a drag from the freshly lit cigarette nestled between his lips.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Waiting for him at the end of the corridor was an older gentleman.</p>, <p>Sporting a bald head and a thick graying mustache, the man stood erect, his slightly protruding belly. In spite of his physical features, he radiated an undeniable aura of authority as the Inquisitor's pace slowed, and he lowered his head.</p>, <p>\"Warden.\"</p>, <p>\"....Have you found anything?\"</p>, <p>The Warden's voice was rough and dry.</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>\"I've got something.\"</p>, <p>Hallowe nibbled on his cigarette before taking it out and letting the smoke linger on his lips.</p>, <p>\"His emotions. They were manipulated.\"</p>, <p>The warden's brow raised.</p>, <p>\"An Emotive mage?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah, and a powerful one at that.\"</p>, <p>The Inquisitor's expression turned a little grim. What made Emotive Mages so dangerous? Was it their skill in battle that could disrupt an opponent's flow...? Or was it their support during difficult situations?</p>, <p>It was neither.</p>, <p>The scariest part about Emotive Mages was that they could manipulate just about anyone into doing something they'd normally not do.</p>, <p>By exploiting a weakness and carefully pushing certain buttons...</p>, <p>\"He exploited Bucklam's past and situation and convinced him to do what he did. He most likely was told he'd get healed if he accomplished his job or some nonsense like that. He still hasn't talked, but that's most likely the case since the traces still linger on his body.\"</p>, <p>\"....You didn't hurt him did you?\"</p>, <p>\"No. I'm not into that stuff.\"</p>, <p>\"I was just asking to make sure. Don't want to deal with the annoying aftermath.\"</p>, <p>The Warden then proceeded to frown.</p>, <p>\"What I'm more surprised about is the fact that this happened in Haven. Those guys...\"</p>, <p>Shaking his head, he chuckled.</p>, <p>\"...They were so busy preparing for outside threats that they didn't take into account internal ones. It's the first time I've seen them make such a mistake.\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah...\"</p>, <p>Hallowe agreed to some degree. To some extent, this incident was out of carelessness from the Institute. Because Professor Bucklam had worked with them for so long, nobody thought he was mentally unstable.</p>, <p>It was hence why his actions probably came as a massive surprise to them. While there were means to protect oneself against Emotive Mages, such means were rare and expensive. It wasn't as if the Academy could afford have all cadets and professors to use them.</p>, <p>That brought rise to several questions.</p>, <p>Who was the Emotive Mage behind this, and... Why did he target the cadets? No, cadet.</p>, <p>From the reports, it was clear that he had a specific target.</p>, <p>Leon Ellert.</p>, <p>\"Um.\"</p>, <p>He was a talented cadet in the report.</p>, <p>But that was it...</p>, <p>If the professor's goal was to target talented students, he could've gone for Julien who was ranked above Leon.</p>, <p>If their goal was Haven then Julien's death would've been more impactful.</p>, <p>'Surely, there must be something else....'</p>, <p>\"...What are you going to do now?\"</p>, <p>As his thoughts were broken by the Warden's voice, Hallowe raised his head. Nibbling onto the cigarette, he thought about his words before answering.</p>, <p>\"I'll be going to Haven.\"</p>, <p>\"Haven?\"</p>, <p>The Warden raised his brows in surprise.</p>, <p>\"Are you going to interrogate the cadets?\"</p>, <p>\"....Something like that.\"</p>, <p>But not exactly.</p>, <p>Outside of Leon, there was one individual he was particularly interested in. During the investigation, he had shown Bucklam four pictures. He had only reacted to one.</p>, <p>'Julien of the Evenus Barony and the Black Star.'</p>, <p>It was funny.</p>, <p>He too was an Emotive Mage. A very talented one at that.</p>, <p>'A connection...?'</p>, <p>It seemed unlikely given the potency of the spell used on Bucklam, but... He certainly knew something he didn't. Bucklam wouldn't have reacted like that otherwise.</p>, <p>It was an intriguing thought.</p>, <p>One that teased his mind the more he dabbled on it.</p>, <p>'Looks like I have no choice.'</p>, <p>To satisfy his curiosity…</p>, <p>He had to go.</p>, <p>Flick—</p>, <p>Hallowe flicked his cigarette away before lowering his head.</p>, <p>\"Thank you for sparing me the time. I found what I needed. I'll be heading off now.\"</p>, <p>\".....Alright, take care.\"</p>, <p>\"Will do.\"</p>, <p>Placing on his leather gloves, Hallowe lowered his head at the Warden before leaving.</p>, <p>As his steps echoed across the spirling stairway, his thoughts couldn't help but drift toward the situation.</p>, <p>Julien.</p>, <p>Leon.</p>, <p>'.....Is there truly no connection?'</p>, <p>\"I wonder.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Returning to his dorm after the inauguration, Leon stood still in the silence.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>His gaze was locked on the drawer by his bedside. With careful steps, he neared the drawer and opened it. Nestled inside the drawer was a small box.</p>, <p>Taking out the box, he carefully placed his hand over the box where a white glow formed.</p>, <p>Click--</p>, <p>Only then did it open to reveal its contents. Nestled deep within the box was a black chalice.</p>, <p>An old and antique one.</p>, <p>The contents within the chalice were empty, but there was a strange allure about the chalice that captivated Leon's sight.</p>, <p>He could hear faint whispers in his mind as he looked at it.</p>, <p>They felt disturbing, and his heart quaked.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>His eyes closed and memories he had kept hidden resurfaced in his mind.</p>, <p>A burning mansion.</p>, <p>The desperate screams.</p>, <p>The ominous, shadowy figures that pursued him relentlessly.</p>, <p>....And the cold, yet warm hand that reached out to him.</p>, <p>\"Huuuu.\"</p>, <p>Leon drew in a deep breath, sealing the box within his grip. When he opened his eyes, an icy coldness spread across his face as he quietly mumbled,</p>, <p>\"They've found me.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Tak--</p>, <p>I stared at the book dropped in front of me and looked up. Delilah sat with her back against her chair. Staring at her, I felt my ear twitch. Recalling the moment when she whispered, 'Come to my office after this' into my ear back at the inauguration ceremony still gave me chills.</p>, <p>Thinking about it, I had the sudden urge to tickle my ear.</p>, <p>'Damn it.'</p>, <p>I forced those thoughts away and looked at the book.</p>, <p>\"....What is this?\"</p>, <p>\"Your reward.\"</p>, <p>Reward?</p>, <p>I leaned forward to get a better look at the book. I noticed a small chocolate bar beside the book, and I felt the back of my hair stand when my hand hovered over it.</p>, <p>Thankfully, it disappeared the moment I picked up the book.</p>, <p>\"Mana Synthesis?\"</p>, <p>What a peculiar name.</p>, <p>\"Your biggest weakness right now is the fact that your mana reserves are low. You're outstanding in everything but in your mana control and reserves. Although it isn't much, this is a Blue-ranked manual. It should help you accumulate more mana and speed up your progress.\"</p>, <p>Blue-ranked manual..?</p>, <p>I was surprised a little surprised by the gift. There were many ways one could increase their strength and jump to the next Tier. One such method was through certain manuals that one could practice to increase their mana reserves which would help one push toward the next Tier.</p>, <p> Manuals were ranked as follows; Green, Blue, Orange, Red, and Black.</p>, <p>Black being the highest.</p>, <p>The Academy provided each cadet with a Green-ranked manual at the start. Being a Barony, the one my family provided was also Green-ranked so it wasn't much of a difference.</p>, <p>Therefore, I was a little taken aback by the sudden gift.</p>, <p>Not that I didn't appreciate it since I didn't hesitate to take it.</p>, <p>\"You're still currently injured so I suggest you memorize the contents of the book before you start practicing. From what I'm seeing, ever since the start of the institute, there has been no progress in your tier. I believe this should help you in that matter.\"</p>, <p>\".....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>Indeed, I was still stuck in the same spot I had been from the start.</p>, <p>In the two weeks I had been in the Academy, besides unlocking a spell, the only progress I had made was in the Emotive field.</p>, <p>I had tried practicing the Green-ranked manual provided by the Institute upon entry, but I struggled to make much progress given that my priorities lay elsewhere. Mainly, in the unlockment of my first [Curse] spell.</p>, <p>But I knew things couldn't go on like this.</p>, <p>I was still lagging behind the other cadets. I needed to make more progress. At the current pace things were going, I wasn't sure I'd be able to survive.</p>, <p>....I needed to pick up the pace.</p>, <p>\"Make sure you don't lose it. I'm only lending the manual to you for now. Once you memorize it, I would need you to give it back to me. The Institute... Is rather strict about these kinds of things.\"</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>I quietly nodded my head before asking,</p>, <p>\"Is there anything else that you need me for?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...\"</p>, <p>\"You can go.\"</p>, <p>Delilah dismissed me while unwrapping the chocolate bar and eating it.</p>, <p>I stood up from my seat and lowered my head slightly.</p>, <p>\"....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>But just before I left, my feet came to a pause and I hesitated.</p>, <p>\"Julien...?\"</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>Whatever.</p>, <p>Turning around, I pointed at my mouth.</p>, <p>\"Your mouth...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Clank--!</p>, <p>Staring at Julien's departing back, Delilah felt her lips twitch as she wiped them with a tissue.</p>, <p>She tossed the tissue to the side right after she was done.</p>, <p>Then, she closed her eyes.</p>, <p>'Have I done the right thing...?'</p>, <p>She was unsure. However, this was necessary. With time, it became clearer and clearer to her.</p>, <p>Julien...</p>, <p>Outside of the Emotive field, he wasn't very talented. A gap would form between him and the current cadets at the current rate that he was progressing.</p>, <p>He may have been able to stand out because of his strong mind and Emotive abilities, but how long could that last?</p>, <p>A month? Two months...?</p>, <p>He didn't have much time, and as someone who had personally vouched for his position, Delilah felt compelled to interfere a little.</p>, <p>A Blue-ranked manual wasn't much to the Academy. However, it was an important asset.</p>, <p>The manuals couldn't be read as many times as one pleased. A certain mana flow was imbued into the book which would decrease with each read.</p>, <p>It wasn't an infinite resource.</p>, <p>Unless someone wrote the manual again, it'd be gone forever. And the higher the rank of the book, the harder it was to create.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that books that were ranked higher than Green were so sparse.</p>, <p>Simply put, the demand for them was too high, and the supply was too low.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Drumming her fingers over her desk, Delilah closed her eyes. Even now, her mind wandered back to the tattoo on his arm.</p>, <p>The more she looked at him, the more confused she became.</p>, <p>'Is he an enemy, or an ally?'</p>, <p>There were signs that pointed him to be an enemy and signs that said otherwise.</p>, <p>Which one was the right sign?</p>, <p>Chewing on her thoughts, Delilah's eyes slowly opened.</p>, <p>\".....I'll only help you out this much.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>When I returned to my dorm, the first thing I did was sit down and open the book.</p>, <p>\"I'm supposed to do this, right...?\"</p>, <p>I placed my hand over the book and channeled my mana over it.</p>, <p>Swoosh.</p>, <p>A pathway appeared in my mind. Seventeen channels, all leading toward the abdomen where my mana core was. The area where my mana gathered.</p>, <p>'That's five more channels than before...'</p>, <p>I immediately put the manual into practice.</p>, <p>As expected, this was a lot better.</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>The notifications appearing in front of me served to prove that.</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>For every five minutes that I followed the channels, a new notification would appear.</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>It went on like this for precisely one hour until I could no longer continue and stopped.</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>My clothes were soaked and my breathing was rough. Even so... I could feel myself progressing. It was unlike anything I had experienced before.</p>, <p>I had managed to progress more in an hour than in the two weeks that I had been in this world.</p>, <p>\"A pity.\"</p>, <p>I wanted to continue practicing, but recalling Delilah's words, I knew that I had to stop.</p>, <p>Further than this and I was risking my life.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I lay on my back and stared at the ceiling of the room.</p>, <p>....I felt a little tired.</p>, <p>It had been a little more than two weeks since I had been in this world, and so much had happened.</p>, <p>It felt as though several months had passed when in reality, it was a lot less than that.</p>, <p>My mind was exhausted and I wanted a little break from everything.

It was Friday, the end of the week.</p>, <p>Things had cooled down after the incident with the professor. The Institute had kept a 'hushed' stance on the situation, stopping all cadets from talking about it.</p>, <p>That wasn't the only thing that changed. Everyone, ranging from cadets to professors, was assigned to a psychiatrist.</p>, <p>「Given the tragic circumstances, the institute has mandated that all personnel and cadets undergo mental health assessments to ensure a situation like this does not happen again.」</p>, <p>Such was the announcement of the Professor in charge of today's lesson.

I didn't need to turn around to know who it was.</p>, <p>\"Kiera Mylne.\"</p>, <p>The Professor sternly spoke.

He was quite young, and his looks were on the good side.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>He didn't follow up from there, but the meaning behind his gaze was quite clear.</p>, <p>'Don't swear.'</p>, <p>\".....Tsk.\"</p>, <p>The class continued from there.</p>, <p>\"Everyone please get on your stations.\"</p>, <p>It was a peculiar class.</p>, <p>\"This over here is how you cook the Mandrigol. First, you cut its stomach open and remove its lungs. When you remove the organs make sure you remove the gall bladder.\"</p>, <p>The name of the class was 「Culinary Guidance」and it focused on teaching the cadets about the monsters in the mirror dimension and how to prepare them.</p>, <p>\"You must remove it as it is highly poisonous to us.\"</p>, <p>Perhaps it was because I had been taking care of myself and my brother for as long as I could remember, I was able to follow the class smoothly.</p>, <p>Tak, tak—</p>, <p>The knife effortlessly sliced the stomach of the creature set in front of me.</p>, <p>It was hard to describe.

What do I do?\"</p>, <p>\"Damn it.\"</p>, <p>Even Aoife appeared to be struggling as her eyes were knit together tightly.</p>, <p>\"Okay, here's the next step. Once you're done cutting the Mandrigol into pieces, place it in the pot in front of you and let it boil in the soup. It's a very tough meat, so we must cook it on a low burn.\"</p>, <p>The Professor then proceeded to place the filets into a large pot in front of him. I also had one, and it had been put on simmer since the start of the lesson.</p>, <p>I had already put the necessary ingredients beforehand so all that was left was...</p>, <p>Plo Plop—!</p>, <p>Chucking the fillets into the pot.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>\"Done.\"</p>, <p>I patted my hands in satisfaction. I felt a strange sense of accomplishment out of this.</p>, <p>\".....Alright! It will take approximately until the end of the lesson for the meat to become tender. For those who are finished, please clean up your stations and wash up your dirty dishes.\"</p>, <p>The Professor's gaze wandered around before eventually falling on me.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>That was when I understood.</p>, <p>I was the only one that had managed to keep up.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Simmer~</p>, <p>Aoife stared at her pot and swallowed her saliva. The water bubbled, and the pieces of the Mandrigol floated at the top.</p>, <p>It wasn't the first time she had eaten the 'Mandrigol'.</p>, <p>While not a rare delicacy, it was still an 'infant' ranked beast. With several noticeable health benefits such as the cleansing of impurities, it was a staple food amongst the population of the Empire.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Plo Plop—!</p>, <p>'I can eat this?'</p>, <p>Aoife secretly swallowed. She had followed the instructions to perfection, so logically yes, but...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She closed the lid.</p>, <p>'Maybe not.'</p>, <p>It didn't look that appetizing.</p>, <p>Aoife looked around her. All the cadets were still busy cutting the Mandrigol. Only a few were done with that part and were now placing the cuts inside of the pot.</p>, <p>All with the exception of one.</p>, <p>'....It's you again.'</p>, <p>He was done a lot faster than them. Nine minutes faster to be exact. The gap between him and the rest was evident, and Aoife felt herself frowning at the thought.</p>, <p>'Why is he so good at everything..?'</p>, <p>In the time that she had spent at the Academy, he had beaten her in almost everything besides the magic and physical score.</p>, <p>There was a gap between them in that matter but...</p>, <p>'He's an Emotive Mage.'</p>, <p>It made sense for him to lag in such matters when he was so proficient in such a field. It was a frustrating thought, but he was... competent.</p>, <p>The thought made her competitive spirit flare up.</p>, <p>'...He may have been faster, but that doesn't mean it's better.\"</p>, <p>Yeah.</p>, <p>Speed wasn't important. What was important was taste.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The image of the contents in her pot flashed in her mind and her blank expression cracked.</p>, <p>Aoife looked around. Julien was still away washing the dishes, and so was the Professor who went out to get a new supply of Mandrigol for the students who failed to cut it on the first try.</p>, <p>A thought struck her.</p>, <p>Just maybe...</p>, <p>\".....Just a little taste.\"</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>She just wanted to check if he had seasoned properly.</p>, <p>Making sure that there was no one paying attention to her, she carried a few trays with her and moved toward Julien's desk.</p>, <p>It was on the way to the cleaning station outside and just a few steps away from her station...</p>, <p>She could play this out well.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her steps stopped at the station. It was clean with the only thing left being the pot and the stove.</p>, <p>Pursing her lips, she looked around before carefully opening the lid of the pot.</p>, <p>Plo Plop—!</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>A nice aroma wafted through the moment she opened the lid and her brow twitched.</p>, <p>\"It can—\"</p>, <p>\"What are you doing?\"</p>, <p>A cold voice echoed from behind her and Aoife almost flinched. Thankfully, she was able to keep herself composed and turned around.</p>, <p>Platinum long hair, deep red eyes, and a gaze that was filled with nothing but contempt.</p>, <p>With a look that suggested she had caught a rat, Kiera smirked.</p>, <p>\".....Are you trying to sabotage the competition?\"</p>, <p>She didn't even try to hide the disdain in her voice.</p>, <p>\"You haven't changed, have you? You're still the same. Whenever someone better than you appears, you try to put them down. Aren't I right?\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned.</p>, <p>'What is she on about?'</p>, <p>She couldn't understand what she was talking about. And perhaps noticing her confusion, Kiera suddenly smirked while shaking her head.</p>, <p>\".....Fucking bitch. You never change.\"</p>, <p>Aoife's face turned cold.</p>, <p>\"What did you call me?\"</p>, <p>\"A. Bitch.\"</p>, <p>Kiera emphasized while leaning her head closer.</p>, <p>\"What? Is the sheltered Princess angry?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A small crack appeared on Aoife's blank expression.</p>, <p>\"You think I wouldn't call you out on your shit? That I would just let you do whatever the fuck you wanted just because you're the fucking princess?\"</p>, <p>The cracks on her face became larger. Her well-maintained facade was slowly crumbling...</p>, <p>\"Still nothing?\"</p>, <p>Kiera's eyes squinted as her smirk became more prominent.</p>, <p>\".....Pathetic.\"</p>, <p>Aoife clenched her teeth and her expression almost crumbled. However, with the little rationality she had left, she turned to look away from her and focused her attention back on the pot.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, she didn't feel like tasting it anymore.</p>, <p>She was just about to close the lid when a finger poked into the soup.</p>, <p>\"Oh? It's not bad.\"</p>, <p>Licking her lips, Kiera looked at Aoife before taking the salt and sprinkling it over the soup.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened and she looked back.</p>, <p>\"It's missing a little salt.\"</p>, <p>\".....Stop it.\"</p>, <p>Her hand reached for the salt, but Kiera deftly avoided her and continued to sprinkle it.</p>, <p>\"Or what?\"</p>, <p>\"It's not my soup.\"</p>, <p>\"So? I'm just helping a classmate out.\"</p>, <p>\"Stop it.\"</p>, <p>Aoife's voice grew cold but that only served to encourage Kiera who doubled down on the salt.</p>, <p>First the middle finger on the first day then this...</p>, <p>Aoife found her patience running thin. Her mana flowed and Kiera's hand stiffened.</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>Unbothered by the look she was receiving, Aoife reached out for the salt when...</p>, <p>\"Kkh...!\"</p>, <p>Her 'Telekinesis' shattered and Kiera's hand swung in the air.</p>, <p>\"Fucking bitch. Who told you that you cou—\"</p>, <p>Plop—!</p>, <p>Her words were broken by an abrupt 'plopping' sound and the two of them stiffened on the spot.</p>, <p>Especially Aoife who found her mouth opening at the sight.</p>, <p>\".....Oh.\"</p>, <p>A single word came out of her lips. When she looked up again, she found Kiera standing rigidly by her side.</p>, <p>A cold voice followed a few seconds after.</p>, <p>\"....What are you doing here?\"</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>For a brief moment, Aoife panicked.</p>, <p>\"Your food... It was overflowing.\"</p>, <p>\"Overflowing?\"</p>, <p>Julien's gaze latched onto her and Aoife felt her mouth go dry. Eventually, though, he turned his gaze away and focused it on the pot.</p>, <p>His nose wrinkled at the sight of the soup.</p>, <p>Aoife's face tightened.</p>, <p>\"Where is the salt?\"</p>, <p>His gaze wandered back to her and she almost flinched. Thankfully, she was quick-witted.</p>, <p>\"Kiera borrowed it.\"</p>, <p>She pointed at Kiera and threw her under the bus. Feeling her finger, Kiera opened her eyes to rebuke but ultimately stopped and nodded.</p>, <p>\"You were done, so...\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>The two simultaneously sighed in relief at that moment and Kiera glared at Aoife who silently felt the corner of her lips pull.</p>, <p>Throwing her under the bus like that… It felt strangely nice.</p>, <p>\"….Give it back to me when you're done.\"</p>, <p>\"Will do.\"</p>, <p>With a quiet nod, Julien shifted his attention back to the pot. What he didn't notice was the sudden change in Aoife and Kiera's expressions.</p>, <p>\"It should be ready.\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Especially when he picked up the spoon by his right.</p>, <p>Unable to notice anything out of the ordinary, Julien lifted the spoon to reveal a thick viscous brown liquid.</p>, <p>\"Looks good.\"</p>, <p>Aoife felt every part of her body grow tense. The same was true for Kiera whose entire face was twitching.</p>, <p>And then, under the horrified eyes of the two of them…</p>, <p>Julien brought the spoon to his mouth.</p>, <p>\"....Um!\"</p>, <p>His expression immediately shifted the moment the spoon touched his mouth and his head flicked their way. A strange tension lingered over the area they were in as his voice, colder than it usually was, asked,</p>, <p>\".....Did you do something to the soup?\"</p>, <p>\"No…\"</p>, <p>\"No.</p>, <p>The two of them shook their heads at the same time though their refusal sounded anything but convincing.</p>, <p>Even so…</p>, <p>\"Is that so?\"</p>, <p>Strangely, Julien didn't seem all that bothered.</p>, <p>Putting the spoon down, he frowned. It was as if he was undecided about something.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>Just when the two of them were fearing for the worst, they heard his soft mumble,</p>, <p>\"....Since when was I such a good cook?\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was a dilemma. Staring at the soup in front of me, I looked back at Aoife and Kiera, who seemed strangely stiff.</p>, <p>'Did they really do nothing to the soup....?'</p>, <p>I brought the spoon to my mouth and closed my eyes. My tonsils danced at the rich taste that invaded my tongue, and I found myself quietly nodding.</p>, <p>It tasted phenomenal.</p>, <p>To the point where I couldn't help but mumble to myself.</p>, <p>\".....Since when was I such a good cook?\"</p>, <p>While I didn't think I was bad, I had never made something so good.</p>, <p>Could it be because of the ingredients?</p>, <p>Was that what it was?</p>, <p>\"Y-you think it's really good...?\"</p>, <p>Kiera stuttered from the side, and I frowned. What's wrong with her? Perhaps noticing my expression, she forced a smile and turned back.</p>, <p>\"Ah, anyway. Thanks for the salt.\"</p>, <p>She proceeded to head back to her station. That was when I felt another gaze.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I turned to look at Aoife, who was staring back at me. Her expression was hard to read, but for a brief moment, I thought I saw 'disbelief' in her gaze.</p>, <p>What sort of...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Picking up her trays, she left without saying another word. I stared at her back for a brief moment before shrugging my shoulders.</p>, <p>I really couldn't understand her.</p>, <p>Staring at her back for a brief moment, I turned my attention back to my pot and had another taste.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>I smacked my lips together and frowned.</p>, <p>\"....It's good.\"</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"It's missing something.\"</p>, <p>What exactly? I thought for a moment before coming to a conclusion.</p>, <p>\"It needs more salt.\"</p>, <p>The taste was a little too mild. Possibly sweet. It needed a little bit more salt.</p>, <p>I reached to my left, where the salt was, but I grasped nothing but air. I was confused at first, but then I remembered.</p>, <p>\"Ah, right.\"</p>, <p>Kiera had taken the salt.</p>, <p>I turned to look at her, and our eyes met. She raised her brow.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\".....The salt.\"</p>, <p>I pointed at the one she had on her desk.</p>, <p> \"...!\"</p>, <p>\"Can I have i—</p>, <p>Clank, Clank, Clank—!</p>, <p>I was interrupted by a loud noise. When I turned to look, I saw Aoife standing with all the trays on the floor. Her otherwise blank expression showed signs of breaking as her eyes widened.</p>, <p>What...?</p>, <p>She wasn't the only one who was behaving oddly.</p>, <p>Just as I turned my head, I heard Kiera's low mutter.</p>, <p>\"...Lunatic.\"</p>, <p>She was also looking at me with wide eyes.</p>, <p>\"Fucking lunatic.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>When I woke up, it was Saturday morning. In a daze, I remained on the bed and stared at the ceiling. I finally had a day to myself...</p>, <p>It was hard to describe how I currently felt. The days had been so hectic that every single day felt like they lasted a year.</p>, <p>But today was different...</p>, <p>There was nothing on my schedule today.</p>, <p>Finally, I could take a much-needed break.</p>, <p>Let's take a shower.</p>, <p>Shaaa—</p>, <p>I needed something to wake my groggy mind. The cold water was especially useful, as I felt refreshed coming out of the shower.</p>, <p>There was nothing better than a cold shower in the morning to refresh my mind.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I looked at my wet body in the mirror.</p>, <p>It was chiselled to perfection, and there seemed to be no scars or imperfections. My shoulders and biceps were quite large, while my abdominal muscles were finely sculpted, and my thighs felt as solid as rock.</p>, <p>I had always wanted this type of body in my previous life. I would always tell myself to go to the gym on a daily basis, but I would stop with some sort of nonsensical excuse. The longest I had ever lasted at the gym was two months.</p>, <p>Seeing no progress in the mirror, I lost all motivation and just gave up.</p>, <p>But things were different now.</p>, <p>I touched my body.</p>, <p>With how hard I was training at the moment, I could easily maintain this body. Not only that, but it could probably get even better in the future.</p>, <p>\"A pity it isn't my real body.\"</p>, <p>It was still hard for me to fully associate myself with this body. However, I was slowly getting there.</p>, <p>Even so...</p>, <p>\"When I return, I'll get my old body back...\"</p>, <p>I was merely rumbling at this point. The reality was that I wasn't sure if I could go back or not. No sign pointed out to that fact.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>I had to cling to this idea. It was the only thing that kept me going. If I were to learn that I couldn't go back, then...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>Opening them again, I leaned forward to stare at my reflection.</p>, <p>\".....I will be going back.\"</p>, <p>After drying my body, I went on to sit on the couch.

I was in no mood for anything. But that seemed to be the case for him as well.</p>, <p>In the silence, we walked towards the entrance of the Academy.</p>, <p>When we reached the place, ten people were already waiting for us at the entrance.</p>, <p>...With eleven names on the list, we were essentially the last to arrive.</p>, <p>\"You two are finally here.\"</p>, <p>At the forefront stood someone I found somewhat familiar.

The train to Lens will depart in ten minutes. You will be held responsible if we miss the train.\"</p>, <p>His rough voice echoed throughout as I picked up the pace, slightly...</p>, <p>Honestly, I wouldn't mind missing it.</p>, <p>The Professor continued,</p>, <p>\"As many of you know, there will be a Draft at the end of the year.

Taking a step closer, we were only a few steps away from each other.

It therefore took us about ten minutes to get there from the train station.</p>, <p>A crowd had already formed at the entrance of the building. It was hard to see through the packed crowd, with reporters mingling among regular people. Thankfully, there was a separate area we could enter from.</p>, <p>\"Welcome to the House of Picks.\"</p>, <p>It was a middle-aged man with refined clothing that greeted us.</p>, <p>\"You must be the distinguished guests from Haven.

I originally expected him to guide us toward the hall in the vision, but contrary to my expectations, we were guided toward a different place.</p>, <p>A private room of some sort.</p>, <p>'Wow.'</p>, <p>Coming into the room, I had to pause for a moment to admire the setting.</p>, <p>At the forefront of the room, a grand window greeted my sight, below which stretched a substantial stage adorned with hundreds of seats now filling with attendees. All of whom were wearing formal clothing, unlike the rest of us.</p>, <p>The scene below appeared chaotic unlike where we were.</p>, <p>\"The announcement will be made shortly.\"</p>, <p>The butler proceeded to say from the entrance of the room.</p>, <p>\"Please feel free to enjoy yourselves in this room for now. Once the announcement is over, we will invite you all to the main ceremony where you can interact with the other guests.\"</p>, <p>With a bow, he went on to talk with the Professor who had a few things to ask.</p>, <p>Only then did the other cadets finally start speaking again.</p>, <p>\"Wow, this room looks awesome.\"</p>, <p>\"Can we take this food?\"</p>, <p>Despite most of the participants being sons of high nobles, they still seemed somewhat excited about the situation.</p>, <p>Well, all besides a select few. Aoife, Kiera, and Leon were the exception as they immediately found a seat and sat down.</p>, <p>I thought about finding a seat as well when...</p>, <p>\".....Here.\"</p>, <p>Someone handed me a black book.</p>, <p>\"This is?\"</p>, <p>\"It's the shop list.\"</p>, <p>Shop list?</p>, <p>I blinked my eyes and looked to my right where a person stood. I had grown a little familiar with him. I didn't remember at first, but I couldn't forget about him after meeting him during the forest incident.</p>, <p>Had it not been for him, I would've been unable to prevent the incident.</p>, <p>Anders Lewis Richmond.</p>, <p>Ever since that incident, his attitude toward me underwent a complete change.</p>, <p>He no longer seemed confrontational; in fact, he appeared to be making an effort to foster a friendlier relationship with me.</p>, <p>I was put off at first, but seeing how his intentions weren't malicious, I let him be.</p>, <p>\"As you probably know, the House of Picks is actually a famous auction house. Although there is no auction today, the shop is still open. If you're interested in something, you can try buying it.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>I nodded slightly and opened the book.</p>, <p>'I wonder if there's anything I can buy...'</p>, <p>I was somewhat intrigued.</p>, <p>[Mana Association Green] — 50,000 Rend.</p>, <p>[Essence Awakenening Green] — 70, 000 Rend.</p>, <p>[Melton Mana Manual Green] — 120, 000 Rend.</p>, <p>'Holy fuck.'</p>, <p>My heart almost jumped at the sight of the prices.</p>, <p>The currency within this world was called 'Rend'. If I had to make a conversion rate compared to my old world, then it'd probably be 1 Rend for one Dollar...? The purchasing power seemed to be about the same.</p>, <p>....And just looking at the prices of the Green Ranked book, I knew that I had no business here.</p>, <p>I may have been the son of a noble, but the amount of money that I had didn't even come close to letting me purchase a Green-ranked book.</p>, <p>What sort of corruption was this...?</p>, <p>I immediately skimmed past the first few pages, but...</p>, <p>'100,000 Rend.... 1,000,000 Rend.... 17,000,000 Rend...'</p>, <p>The deeper I went, the more absurd the prices became. It was to the point where I was just scrolling through the book for the sake of wasting time.</p>, <p>As if I could afford any of this stuff.</p>, <p>That was until I found myself pausing toward a certain section.</p>, <p>[Metryl Bone] — 4, 320, 000 Rend.</p>, <p>A certain image captured my attention and my eyes widened.</p>, <p>'This is...'</p>, <p>It was only a picture, but the overlapped with the image in my mind. The one from the vision.</p>, <p>Ah—</p>, <p>The more I looked at it, the more certain I felt...</p>, <p>'....It's the item that was found in the vision.'</p>, <p>The one that caused all of the commotion.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I blinked and took a seat.</p>, <p>\"Huu..\"</p>, <p>So it was a bone.</p>, <p>I swallowed my saliva and stared at the image once more.</p>, <p>'So the item that she was framed with was this bone...'</p>, <p>It looked nothing like a bone, but perhaps there was something that I was missing. Either way, I understood now.</p>, <p>The reason why the situation seemed so serious.</p>, <p>So then...</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>Why did my chest tingle at the sight of the item on the list?</p>, <p>It wasn't just that, my fingers... They were twitching.</p>, <p>Thoughts I wasn't supposed to have suddenly engulfed my mind. As I sat down on my seat seat, my foot started to tap against the ground.</p>, <p>As I continued to stare at the listing, I silently swallowed.</p>, <p>A thought crossed my mind.</p>, <p>One that I wasn't supposed to have.</p>, <p>\"This orb...\"</p>, <p>Can I take it for myself....?</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>There will be two more chapters later.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>A tall man stood on the stage.</p>, <p>His appearance grabbed the attention of all those presents.</p>, <p>--Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for coming to the inauguration of the 57th seventh draft.</p>, <p>As he spoke, his voice boomed throughout the grand hall. It silenced all the noise within the venue.</p>, <p>--It's with great pride that I stand before you as the announcer of today's event....</p>, <p>He went on with the introductions. Useless ramblings that went on for several minutes before the lights turned off. What followed after was silence as the noise ceased.</p>, <p>--We will now be introducing the fifteen Guilds.</p>, <p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh--!</p>, <p>Fifteen banners fell from the sides, all displaying different intricate patterns and colors.</p>, <p>Lights flickered, pointing toward each banner, displaying their extravagance for all to see.</p>, <p>They appeared finely crafted, adorned with intricate golden patterns, and fashioned from rare fabrics. The patterns and insignias appeared to be meticulously handcrafted, with each banner's design particularly unique standing out in one way or another.</p>, <p>On any normal occasion, I would've been intrigued by the events.</p>, <p>But....</p>, <p>'I can take it can I...?'</p>, <p>All I could think about was the quest. Or more specifically, the bone.</p>, <p>Just how much stronger would I become if I were to take the bone?</p>, <p>A human was only allowed to implant five bones into their body. Any more would be too dangerous.</p>, <p>However, from what I had read, after the integration of the bone, one would find their strength increasing and be granted an [Innate] ability that used to belong to the soul of the deceased beast.</p>, <p>....It was an extremely enticing opportunity, and I knew that I couldn't let it slip away from my grasp.</p>, <p>Especially given my current strength. I was in desperate need of something like that.</p>, <p>\"But what about the quest...?\"</p>, <p>Would it allow it?</p>, <p>The quest didn't specify what I needed to do. In my mind, what the quest demanded from was to expose the fraud and prevent Evelyn from reaching the scenario from the vision.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>There was nothing in the quest that suggested I couldn't take the bone.</p>, <p>...And it wasn't as if the quest could control me. Whether I chose to complete the mission or not, I had full freedom of choice.</p>, <p>Since that was the case...</p>, <p>Why couldn't I take the bone?</p>, <p>'I know who will have it. When she will have it. And how they find it.'</p>, <p>For what reason can I not find a way to take the bone for myself?</p>, <p>The more I thought about it, the more I felt my chest prickle.</p>, <p>Ah...</p>, <p>This sensation.</p>, <p>It threatened to consume my mind at any second. It was foreign at first, but it became clearer with the passing of time.</p>, <p>Greed.</p>, <p> Right, I was being greedy.</p>, <p>I was coveting something that shouldn't have been mine in the first place.</p>, <p>\"Heh.\"</p>, <p>For some reason, the thought made me want to laugh.</p>, <p>I thought about all the implications that my actions would have on the innocent workers and staff of the auction house. It pricked at my consciousness, but at the same time, I knew that I couldn't afford to be sentimental.</p>, <p>'Morality.'</p>, <p>I needed to throw it away.</p>, <p>I was no longer Emmet Rowe.</p>, <p>Morality was no longer a thing for me. While I had a few lines that I couldn't bring myself to cross, the rest... I had to throw them away.</p>, <p>I had sworn I'd do anything to become stronger and achieve my goal.</p>, <p>And....</p>, <p>Taking the bone... Knowing that it was something I could do, and would be instrumental for my goal...</p>, <p>I knew I had to do it.</p>, <p>Right...</p>, <p>Because in the end, I couldn't afford to miss such a chance.</p>, <p>For my sake.</p>, <p>I had to be greedy.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Ever since the start of the inauguration, Evelyn felt weird. It felt as though someone was watching her every movement. And yet, when she looked, all she saw was the empty space behind her.</p>, <p>'Is it just me...?'</p>, <p>She looked to her left and then right. Once she was sure there was nothing wrong, she returned her gaze back to the front.</p>, <p>Her eyebrows slowly came to a furrow.</p>, <p>She could've sworn she had felt something. And she usually was never wrong about these things.</p>, <p>Her senses were generally quite accurate.</p>, <p>\"Strange...\"</p>, <p>\"What is?\"</p>, <p>A dry voice reached her ears.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened at the sound of the voice and her head flicked to her right where a familiar figure was sitting.</p>, <p>\"Julien?\"</p>, <p>What is he...?</p>, <p>\"Ha.\"</p>, <p>Her shock hardly lasted more than a couple of seconds before her face returned back to its normal icy one. It was a face she only displayed to those she deemed 'unfamiliar'.</p>, <p>Indeed, the current Julien was someone she was unfamiliar with.</p>, <p>\"I was getting a weird feeling before. I thought someone was watching me, but I didn't think it'd be you of all people.\"</p>, <p>Things were starting to make sense to her now. The strange sensation... It was him wasn't he?</p>, <p>He was the one that was looking at her. Or at least, that was Evelyn thought to be the case.</p>, <p>But then again, why would he even look at her now when he had hardly paid her any attention back at the Institute?</p>, <p>She had liked the way things were so why the sudden change?</p>, <p>Was she missing something?</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her thoughts were further reinforced by his silence, and she felt puzzled.</p>, <p>\"Is there something that you want to say?\"</p>, <p>\"Um?\"</p>, <p>Julien raised his brow and the two of them looked at each other.</p>, <p>Evelyn frowned.</p>, <p>\"You didn't come all the way here for nothing, right?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>He didn't bother answering her as he seemed lost in his thoughts. Evelyn found herself growing annoyed by his antics.</p>, <p>An image overlapped with his. It was a younger version of him. Unlike the current stoic expression he wore, he wore a look filled with nothing but disdain.</p>, <p>'Certainly, he's different from the past, but....'</p>, <p>Her mind was brought back to the memories of five years ago. It was a memory she could never forget. Regardless of how hard she tried, she couldn't forget. Even now, she could distinctly remember everything.</p>, <p>From the weather to the smells...</p>, <p>Everything felt vivid to her.</p>, <p>....And it was exactly because it felt so vivid that she couldn't find herself to see him differently.</p>, <p>'He's the same. He may act differently, but inside... He's the same.'</p>, <p>That's right.</p>, <p>She mustn't be fooled by how he was currently behaving. Five years may have passed, but what he had done that day...</p>, <p>'I won't be fooled.'</p>, <p>At that moment, Evelyn caught sight of Julien. Leaning against the chair, his lips gently pulled into what seemed to be a smile. Her expression hardened.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>\".....It's nothing.\"</p>, <p>With a shake of his head, he gradually stood up.</p>, <p>\"I've already got what I wanted.\"</p>, <p>\".....?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn felt lost staring at him. What sort of game was he playing? She was just about to speak when his voice suddenly cut in.</p>, <p>\"Enjoy your evening.\"</p>, <p>\".....Ah.\"</p>, <p>He left shortly after that, leaving Evelyn unable to utter a single thing back.</p>, <p>In the end...</p>, <p>She hadn't figured out if he was truly the one that was looking at her.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'...She's being targeted.'</p>, <p>That was the conclusion that I came up with after talking to her briefly. I first drew up that conclusion from how she was behaving. Noticing how she'd turn her head to look around from time to time, I knew that something was up.</p>, <p>Would someone act like that unless they felt that something was off?</p>, <p>I would've normally not bothered, but superhumans tended to be a lot more accurate at judging these kinds of things.</p>, <p>It was highly likely that she was truly being watched.</p>, <p>....It was also for this reason that I initiated a conversation with her.</p>, <p>I needed to verify this conclusion. It was an important piece of information after all.</p>, <p>The end result...</p>, <p>'I thought someone was watching me, but I didn't think it'd be you of all people.'</p>, <p>She indeed felt like someone was watching her.</p>, <p>While it was indeed true that I was also watching her, that had only been from the point where she had started to act suspiciously.</p>, <p>Before that, I had been in my own thoughts. Thinking about the vision, and the quest. Only when I had digested everything did I turn my attention to her and notice her strange attitude.</p>, <p>In any case, I was now certain of a few things.</p>, <p>'The culprit might be someone from this room, and he's targeting her directly.'</p>, <p>I had been worried that in the vision she had merely been the 'culprit' out of bad luck.</p>, <p>That perhaps, whoever the thief was, made her the culprit simply because she was the easiest target to place the blame on.</p>, <p>If such a scenario were to be true, then I wasn't confident I could 'steal' the item.</p>, <p>Mainly because I couldn't guarantee the fact that I could act exactly as the version of me had in the vision. There was a real chance that someone else would've been used as a target instead of Evelyn.</p>, <p>All because of my actions in trying to interfere with the situation.</p>, <p>Some sort of butterfly effect...</p>, <p>But now that I was more or less sure that she was the intended target, I didn't need to worry about the vision changing too drastically.</p>, <p>The bone was going to be with her.</p>, <p>....And that was all the information that I needed to formulate a plan.</p>, <p>What I needed to do next was wait.</p>, <p>Wait for everything to begin.</p>, <p>When that happens...</p>, <p>'I'll take it all.'</p>, <p>Game progression, character progression, and bone...</p>, <p>\".....I'll take everything.\"</p>, <p>Such was how big my greed was.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Already writing the next chap. Will try my best to get it done soon. It's a very big chap.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>And with that, I will now be ending my speech. For any of you who are present, there will be an after-party that you may be able to attend.</p>, <p>The announcer's voice boomed, signaling the end of the ceremony. Just before he ended things, he made a small announcement.</p>, <p>—To the cadets who are present, take this chance to get acquainted with your competitors as well as get a better understanding of the fifteen major Guilds. It will be a great opportunity for you in the long term.</p>, <p>It was on that note that he finally left the stage and the hall erupted into a wave of applause.</p>, <p>Clap, clap, clap—!</p>, <p>Evelyn joined in the clapping, and just as Evelyn clapped once, the chair beside her skidded back.</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah? What? What's going on...?!\"</p>, <p>With visibly groggy eyes and messy hair, Kiera looked around in confusion. Then, seeing what everyone was doing, she joined in on the applause.</p>, <p>\"Fucking amazing speech!\"</p>, <p>Clap, clap, clap—!</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Evelyn watched the scene at a loss for words.</p>, <p>She had been sleeping, hadn't she...?</p>, <p>Kiera Mylne. Evelyn's thoughts about her were rather conflicted. On the one hand, she was extremely talented. Rivaling her in almost every category. The only thing that set her off was her personality.</p>, <p>Her words were crude, and she was too confronting. She treated everyone as though they were her enemy, and it was because of that that Evelyn found herself struggling to get along with her.</p>, <p>A bit disappointing considering her talent.</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>With a long sigh, she leaned back on the chair.</p>, <p>The watchful feeling had disappeared about halfway through the speech, and only then did she sigh in relief.</p>, <p>'So it really could've been him...'</p>, <p>Julien.</p>, <p>It had only been a few minutes after he left that she stopped feeling that way. Was it a coincidence...? Or was he truly the one who was keeping an eye out for her?</p>, <p>\"Ma'am. The afterpart will be held in the main hall. If you would please...\"</p>, <p>Disrupting her thoughts was the butler who carefully passed on the same message to all of those present. He proceeded to hand her her purse back.</p>, <p>\"If you keep going ahead, you will be able to find the entrance of the hall. There will be colleagues waiting for you there.\"</p>, <p>\"....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>Without thinking too much, she took the purse and proceeded to head out of the room and toward the main hall.</p>, <p>It was as the butler said.</p>, <p>All she had to do was keep going straight. With many of the guests heading the same way, it wasn't hard for her to reach the hall which was already packed with guests.</p>, <p>The grand hall bustled with activity as hundreds of guests mingled within. Butlers gracefully walked around, presenting silver trays laden with drinks and snacks. Among them, cadets her age strolled about, engaging in superfluous conversations with their peers.</p>, <p>The fake smiles, and fake laughs...</p>, <p>Evelyn could see it from a glance. Being the daughter of a Viscount family, she was used to such scenes. it was something that she had grown accustomed to.</p>, <p>But even so...</p>, <p>\"H-hu...\"</p>, <p>She felt her chest grow heavy. The very air around her felt suffocating, and breathing was starting to become difficult.</p>, <p> 'It's normal... I have to get used to this...'</p>, <p>Her social anxiety was acting up again. Pinching her hand, she bit on her lips and once again took in the fake expressions of all those around her.</p>, <p>It left a sour feeling in her heart.</p>, <p>Especially when...</p>, <p>\"Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Kylian J. Marlin. It's an honor to become acquainted with someone from Haven.\"</p>, <p>She was no different than them.</p>, <p>Putting on a smile, she returned the greeting.</p>, <p>\"The pleasure is mine.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and let the memories sink into my mind.</p>, <p>The faces, the time, the silence... I recalled everything before opening my eyes again. What greeted my sight was the same environment as the vision.</p>, <p>Things were slightly different as the events had yet to unfold, but everything was practically the same.</p>, <p>*Sip*</p>, <p>Taking a sip of my drink, I quietly watched my surroundings. It was hard to not stand out on such an occasion, with multiple individuals trying to strike up a conversation with me.</p>, <p>\"Hell—\"</p>, <p>\"Busy.\"</p>, <p>\"Nice to—\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>I thought about engaging with them for a short moment but decided otherwise.</p>, <p>Such fake pleasantries were meaningless to me.</p>, <p>All I cared about was my greed. I needed to quench it. The idea of not being able to quench it seemed to eat at me.</p>, <p>The bone...</p>, <p>'I have to have it.'</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and took another sip.</p>, <p>'I've got 30 minutes left... The event in the vision plays at 8:03 P.M.'</p>, <p>There was a massive clock by the wall. It was thanks to it that I was able to know the exact time the event was going to start.</p>, <p>However, the vision started after the search. Meaning that the event started slightly before 8:03 P.M.</p>, <p>In my estimate, taking into account that everyone had to be checked, my estimate was ten minutes.</p>, <p>The event...</p>, <p>It was going to start in ten minutes.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>I felt a strange sense of nervousness all of a sudden.</p>, <p>I was taking a big risk. There was a chance that my actions would lead to me becoming what became of Evelyn in the vision. A criminal.</p>, <p>The thought made me realize.</p>, <p>.....I was walking on thin ice.</p>, <p>My heart quickened and my palms felt sweaty. Nervousness finally started to settle within me. However, I was quick to push it down.</p>, <p>Since the moment that I had appeared in this world, I had been walking on thin ice.</p>, <p>My situation was no different than it had always been.</p>, <p>If anything, I had gotten better at walking in such a situation. My worries... They were meaningless.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I shifted my attention away from my drink and back into the hall. My eyes wandered around until they found a set of familiar purple hair.</p>, <p>Surrounded by over three different people, she casually conversed with them.</p>, <p>\"Does she have it, or not...?\"</p>, <p>There was no way I could confirm this unless I directly checked her purse. But that in itself was a risk.</p>, <p>What if she didn't have it in the purse just yet?</p>, <p>I checked the time.</p>, <p>7:45 P.M.</p>, <p>I started to move.</p>, <p>Wherever I walked, I felt gazes directed my way. I let them be and continued forward.</p>, <p>\"I'm envious of your talent. Surely, you'll be able to rank high in the draft at the end of the year. I hope that I too will reach a high rank.\"</p>, <p>\"When you become successful, make sure you don't forget me.\"</p>, <p>\"....I won't.\"</p>, <p>I only stopped when I found a familiar back. The conversation died, and all eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>\"Julien...?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn seemed especially shocked by my appearance. I glanced at the people gathered around her before returning my attention.</p>, <p>\"I need to talk to you.\"</p>, <p>As if I had said the most shocking thing, her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"You...\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I continued to stare at her silently. Eventually, she pursed her lips and nodded her head. With a polite smile, she dismissed the cadets around her before following me toward a more secluded part of the hall.</p>, <p>She was the first one to break the silence.</p>, <p>\"....I didn't need saving.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Saving?</p>, <p>From what?</p>, <p>She frowned and insisted.</p>, <p>\"Really.\"</p>, <p>I became even more confused but nodded.</p>, <p>\"If you say so.\"</p>, <p>I thought she would be satisfied with that, but it only deepened her frown.</p>, <p>\"You're wrong. I really didn't need you to save me. I could've handled the situation well...\"</p>, <p>I continued to nod along.</p>, <p>\"Sure.\"</p>, <p>\"You, you...\"</p>, <p>But it seemed it only irritated her further. Clenching her teeth, she looked around before leaning closer to whisper.</p>, <p>'I no longer have social anxiety. I've fixed that five years ago. I'm no longer the same person. Don't misunderstand...'</p>, <p>\"Oh, okay.\"</p>, <p>Social anxiety?</p>, <p>That was a new piece of information to me.</p>, <p>Still, seeing her so desperately trying to justify herself before me felt rather funny. For a moment, I almost lost my composure and laughed.</p>, <p>But as I reminded myself of the situation, I recomposed myself and looked toward her purse.</p>, <p>\"Your purse. Care to open it up?\"</p>, <p>\"I swear, I real—Uh?\"</p>, <p>She blinked several times. Then, as if processing my words, her expression crumbled. I stopped her before she could say anything.</p>, <p>\"You were right. Someone was watching you.\"</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>Her expression changed.</p>, <p>\"Be subtle when opening your purse. It's probably hidden somewhere, but it's there.\"</p>, <p>\"What is...?\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer and moved closer, using my back as some form of shield.</p>, <p>\"Be quick.\"</p>, <p>\"You, what—\"</p>, <p>\"Check.\"</p>, <p>I cut her off again. Her expression changed yet again, but as if noticing the seriousness in my tone, she lowered her head and subtly opened her purse.</p>, <p>\".....Fine.\"</p>, <p>As she gritted her teeth, she added.</p>, <p>\"But if there's really nothing, see what I'll do to you.\"</p>, <p>A strange silence took over our area as Evelyn rummaged through her purse. Seconds ticked, and she had continued to rummage through.</p>, <p>I felt my chest heave with unease with each second that passed. Doubtful thoughts started to cross my mind.</p>, <p>'Is it really going to be there?'</p>, <p>'....What if it's not there?'</p>, <p>'Was I too hasty? Should I have waited more...?'</p>, <p>\"Ah—\"</p>, <p>Such thoughts were broken by a strange noise that came out of Evelyn's mouth, when I looked down, I saw her holding a familiar orb.</p>, <p>My mind immediately raced at the sight of it.</p>, <p>'It's here...'</p>, <p>It had really happened.</p>, <p>\"W-what... This...\"</p>, <p>With a clear look of shock and disbelief, Evelyn held the orb in her hand. Her expression was reminiscent of the one she had made in the vision. However, ignoring it, I reached out for her hand and snatched it.</p>, <p>\"Hey, you...\"</p>, <p>\"Stay quiet if you don't want things to blow over.\"</p>, <p>\"Wha...\"</p>, <p>I looked around me. There were a few gazes on me. Some from cadets, and some from older gentlemen. I made sure to memorize the faces of each and every one that was looking at me.</p>, <p>Then, just as I was prepared to leave, a hand reached out to grab me by the arm and pulled me back.</p>, <p>\"I don't know what's going on, but it's best if you had that over to the sta—\"</p>, <p>\"It's already too late for that.\"</p>, <p>I nudged my chin toward the distance. Several guards were already starting to show strange movements.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Her grip loosened from there.</p>, <p>I thought she'd let go of me from that point, but just when I thought I could move, her grip once again tightened.</p>, <p>\"....About what I said before. I really don't have social anxiety.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>\"You, why don't you believe me?\"</p>, <p>\"I believe you.\"</p>, <p>Her expression contorted, but she eventually let me go. I silently shook my head before moving away from her.</p>, <p>There was still one thing left that I needed to do.</p>, <p>But I didn't have much time left.</p>, <p>The guards were already showing signs of movement, and with the bone on me, I knew that if I failed on my next step, I was done for.</p>, <p>Therefore, I hurried my steps.</p>, <p>Gradually, a figure appeared in the distance. He was talking with several people and held a rather lofty position.</p>, <p>He stood tall with skinny facial contours, jet-black hair, a long nose, and bushy eyebrows.</p>, <p>A face that I couldn't forget even if I wanted to.</p>, <p>As his voice boomed down, forcing down judgment on Evelyn, I had a hard time forgetting his face.</p>, <p>Since coming to the decision to take the bone for myself, there was one part that I found particularly difficult to figure out.</p>, <p>How exactly would I be able to sneak the bone out of the venue?</p>, <p>With everyone being searched so thoroughly, how could it be possible for me to smuggle the bone out?</p>, <p>It was then that I had a sudden thought.</p>, <p>'.....Is everyone really going to be searched?'</p>, <p>Sure, he might be able to search every single person in the room, but in fact... there was one person he most likely wouldn't search.</p>, <p>Who exactly....?</p>, <p>Himself.</p>, <p>Right...</p>, <p>Because he knew that he wasn't the culprit.</p>, <p>'Haha.'</p>, <p>It was a daring idea. One that made me want to laugh at how ridiculous it was. But staring at the guards that were slowly starting to walk his way, I grabbed the nearest drink to me and approached.</p>, <p>I had just moved a few meters away from him, when...</p>, <p>\"Oh...!\"</p>, <p>Splash—</p>, <p>I suddenly tripped, spilling the drink all over him.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>As I glanced up, a pair of eyes met mine, their gaze bearing down on me. His black blazer was drenched, creating an eerie stillness in the surrounding space.</p>, <p>My face felt rigid, and my mouth moved soundlessly before finally finding my voice.</p>, <p>\".....I apologize. It was a mistake.\"</p>, <p>I was quick to react.</p>, <p>My initial action was to gently remove the drink from his grasp and set it down on the nearby table. Then, I retrieved a tissue and proceeded to delicately pat down his clothes.</p>, <p>\"....The ground was slippery, and--\"</p>, <p>\"It's fine.\"</p>, <p>He held out his hand to stop me and smiled. The tension that hung around the surroundings eased from that moment on.</p>, <p>Looking up to address the other present, he started to speak in a warmer tone.</p>, <p>\"It was an accident. There's no need for you to worry. The jacket isn't even that expensive.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, but at least let me repay you.\"</p>, <p>\"It's alright.\"</p>, <p>\"But--\"</p>, <p>\"This much is nothing. Please be at ease. I've long heard of your reputation. Take it as a token of friendship from me.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, but...\"</p>, <p>I insisted several times, but he refused me each time. In the end, I had no choice but to stop. I could more or less tell he was starting to grow annoyed by my responses.</p>, <p>Thankfully, he had managed to recognize my identity and wasn't overly harsh to me. Rather, he seemed keen on using the opportunity to build a connection with me.</p>, <p>There were perks to being the Black Star.</p>, <p>\"Be more careful next time.\"</p>, <p>\"....I understand.\"</p>, <p>I lowered my head to apologize again. Just as I did, the guards finally caught up to him and whispered something in his ear.</p>, <p>His expression shifted immediately.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>\"If you'll excuse me for a brief moment.\"</p>, <p>Under my watchful eyes, he picked up his glass and tapped it with his finger.</p>, <p>Ting--! Ting--!</p>, <p>The noise managed to reach the ears of all present.</p>, <p>The noise in the hall quieted down and all eyes fell on him.</p>, <p>Clearing his throat, he smiled.</p>, <p>\"Ladies and gentlemen, there seems to have been an accident.\"</p>, <p>His voice quietly traveled throughout the hall. With the same calming smile, he went on to explain the situation.</p>, <p>\"It's with regret that I have to inform you that one of the prized items of the auction house has been stolen. The reports have come just now, and we still believe that the culprit is hiding amongst one of us.\"</p>, <p>He went on to press his hand against his chest as his head lowered a little.</p>, <p>\"Therefore, I hope that with some understanding, you won't mind if we search all the guests present. I humbly ask as the Head Chief of the Auction House.\"</p>, <p> A strange silence followed shortly after before the entire hall erupted into noise.</p>, <p>\"A thief? If that's the case then I don't see why I should disagree. I've got nothing to hide.\"</p>, <p>\"Are you saying that you're going to keep us here until everyone is searched?\"</p>, <p>\"This... Is this even possible?\"</p>, <p>\"I refuse to be searched!\"</p>, <p>The response was a mix of protests and agreements. But it was only after the members of the fifteen Guilds came up to voice out their support that the noise died down.</p>, <p>\"We agree with the search.\"</p>, <p>\"We've got nothing to hide. Please don't mind us. Search as you want.\"</p>, <p>'....Has he bought them?'</p>, <p>Seeing the strange looks he was giving to the representative members of the Guild, it seemed like a plausible idea.</p>, <p>Or at least... The Auction House and the Guilds were on extremely good terms.</p>, <p>In any case, guards started to pour in from all entrances, blocking people from leaving.</p>, <p>Shortly after, someone came to my side.</p>, <p>\"Please.\"</p>, <p>The Head Chief concluded with another bow.</p>, <p>\"....Thank you for your understanding.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The search continued for the next half hour. Despite the many protests from the guests, and members of the Academies, they went to deaf ears and the search continued.</p>, <p>\"....How is the situation?\"</p>, <p>Overlooking the situation, the Head Chief frowned. It was taking a lot longer than he expected...</p>, <p>It couldn't be that the thief had escaped...?</p>, <p>But how was it possible? The moment the item had been stolen, all exits had been blocked and all the guests present had been kept.</p>, <p>The likelihood that the thief had escaped was slim...</p>, <p>\"Head Chief, we still have found nothing. Most of the guests are showing signs of dissatisfaction. Especially those that have been cleared of suspicions. We've also searched the surroundings and found nothing.\"</p>, <p>Frowning, the Head Chief massaged his chin.</p>, <p>\"How troublesome...\"</p>, <p>All guests had certain standings within the Empire. Their actions were the equivalent of offending such high-class people.</p>, <p>Thankfully, given their great relationship with the fifteen Guilds, the situation had not turned out for the worst, but...</p>, <p>For how long could he keep it like that?</p>, <p>If things progressed at this rate, then there was a chance that he might end up offending several big shots at once.</p>, <p>He had to hurry up. He didn't have much time. Though the item stolen was expensive and would lead to substantial losses, it was something he could take given the circumstances.</p>, <p>He'd much rather want to keep the guests happy than lose out on the money.</p>, <p>Money could always be made. Connections...?</p>, <p>That was much harder.</p>, <p>But of course...</p>, <p>If he could, he'd like to find the culprit. What sort of person would not care about catching the thief who had stolen from them?</p>, <p>'See what happens when I catch that bastard...'</p>, <p>His grip on his drink tightened at the thought.</p>, <p>However, if they still couldn't find the culprit before the situation turned out like that, he would have no choice but to give up.</p>, <p>\"Just where could it be...?\"</p>, <p>The Head Chief felt his head throb, and his head turned to face a young man not so far from where he was. He currently was getting his body checked, but from how the guards were responding, he didn't seem to be guilty.</p>, <p>Even so, seeing his face, the Head Chief silently clicked his tongue.</p>, <p>'.....An idiot.'</p>, <p>Such was his evaluation of the Haven Black Star.</p>, <p>Who would've thought he'd be such an idiot...? Recalling how his blazer had been smeared with his drink, the Head Chief felt his lips twitch.</p>, <p>The suit wasn't cheap. He had only lied to maintain his image.</p>, <p>It was in fact extremely expensive.</p>, <p>If it weren't for his position as the Black Star, then...</p>, <p>\"Um?\"</p>, <p>The Head Chief felt his hand suddenly pause and his expression changed.</p>, <p>He looked around him. All guards were busily checking patting down and checking the items of all guests present.</p>, <p>A sudden thought struck him then and he put the drink in his hand down.</p>, <p>The way he looked at the cadet near him changed as he tried to recall the incident. Out of nowhere, he had suddenly tripped over and spilled his drink on him. Thereafter, he went on to try to dry his clothes...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Blinking his eyes, he almost found himself laughing.</p>, <p>Right...</p>, <p>Of course.</p>, <p>Why didn't he think about it? Of all the people present, who was the most likely person to not get checked?</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>He laughed out loud then. Turning his attention towards one of the nearest guards, he extended his hands.</p>, <p>\".....Search me too.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>The guard seemed taken aback, but he didn't mind. Nudging with his chin, the Head Chief's gaze wandered back to the young man as his eyes narrowed.</p>, <p>If his guesses were correct, then...</p>, <p>He had found his culprit.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>The search took quite a while.</p>, <p>Patting down our bodies and using a strange item while doing so, it felt as though every part of my body was being checked. Most likely, the device helped to detect through the human flesh. In the off-chance the thief swallowed the item, then they'd be able to tell.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>My arms were pressed.</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>My legs were pressed.</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>My pockets were checked.</p>, <p>I remained silent the entire time and kept my heart beating at a steady state.</p>, <p>Especially when I felt a certain gaze directed toward me. I felt the back of my hair stand under such gaze.</p>, <p>My palms were sweaty and I had a strange urge to fidget my hand.</p>, <p>Even so, I kept myself from showing any noticeable reaction until the search was finally over.</p>, <p>\"It looks like you're good to go. Nothing has been found on you.\"</p>, <p>Only then did I finally step back. As I turned my head, I found myself locking eyes with another individual, causing a subtle tightening of my expression. He was looking at me with a gaze that seemed to say, 'I've got you...' I wondered what he was on about at first, but after seeing that he was also getting searched, I understood.</p>, <p>Ah--</p>, <p>I covered my mouth at that moment.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Swallowing my saliva, I forced myself to remain composed and stood still. My left hand twitched, and I wasn't able to stop my fingers from fidgeting together.</p>, <p>Such action was caught by his gaze as just faintly, the end of his lips curled.</p>, <p>\".....You, there.\"</p>, <p>Finally, he called out for me.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I didn't respond immediately and pursed my lips.</p>, <p>He nudged me with his finger.</p>, <p>\"Come here...\"</p>, <p>His voice came out dry and commanding.</p>, <p>I swallowed before following his instructions and moved near him, only stopping at the opposite end of the table where a drink filled with ice appeared.</p>, <p>I unconsciously reached out for it and he didn't stop me.</p>, <p>Rather, he seemed to enjoy my actions.</p>, <p>\"There's no need to be nervous.\"</p>, <p>His gaze wandered toward the guards that surrounded him as they were busily checking every part of his body.</p>, <p>Pat, pat--!</p>, <p>They carried a similar procedure to the one like mine, patting his body all over and paying special attention to the blazer.</p>, <p>I felt my expression stiffen further as my grip on the glass tightened.</p>, <p>His voice once again reached me.</p>, <p>\".....Do you want to come clean?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I tilted my head and he leaned closer.</p>, <p>\"If you come clean now, the situation will end more nicely. I'm currently not accusing you because I have no evidence. However...\"</p>, <p>He suddenly smiled.</p>, <p>\"Even though you're trying your best, I can see just how nervous you are. If you just come cle--\"</p>, <p>\"Chief.\"</p>, <p>His sentence was abruptly cut off by one of the guards. As he looked to meet his gaze, his expression quickly changed the moment he spoke.</p>, <p>\"....There's nothing. You're also clear.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>As if not expecting such an answer, his eyes widened and his expression crumbled. I stared at the scene from the opposite side of the table before lowering my head to stare at my drink.</p>, <p>\"Are you sure there's nothing wrong? Did you check correctly...? I...\"</p>, <p>His voice faded in the background as I stared at the drink in my hand. Or more specifically, one of the 'ice cubes' inside.</p>, <p>It blended in so nicely...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I blankly stared at the cubes for a few more seconds before bringing the drink closer to my lips.</p>, <p>Gulp--</p>, <p>Fucking idiot.</p>]\n",

It hurt a little, but I kept my expression firm and prevented myself from showing anything on the outside.</p>, <p>Having been cleared of all suspicion, I was now free to take the bone. I had been waiting for this opportunity from the start.</p>, <p>Since the beginning...</p>, <p>All of it had been flowing as I thought it would.</p>, <p>The way he behaved and reacted... It was in line with how I envisioned he'd act.

Added to the fact that I was tapping his body in an attempt to 'dry' his clothes, it made sense for him to grow suspicious.</p>, <p>I wasn't naïve enough to think that the Head Chief would fall for such a simple trick. It would be a little too obvious.</p>, <p>Which was why I never intended his blazer to be my target.</p>, <p>From the start, all of it was a cover up for my real target.</p>, <p>*Sip*</p>, <p>'.....His drink.'</p>, <p>I swallowed and let the drink flow down my throat.</p>, <p>The 'bone' was the size of a small pebble, and while it wasn't completely transparent, it perfectly blended with the ice cubes within the red drink.</p>, <p>Unless one paid close attention to it, they wouldn't notice.</p>, <p>....And how would the Head Chief notice it when he was busy investigating the theft?</p>, <p>Diverting all my attention towards the jacket, I was able to slip the bone into his drink. As I said before, there was no better target than the Head Chief.</p>, <p>He may have had the guard check him after he recalled my actions, but unlike the other guests, where everything had been checked, from drinks to bodies, he only had his body checked.</p>, <p>It made perfect sense when taking into account that perhaps he hadn't even noticed his drink had been taken away by him in that instant that I spilled the drink over him.</p>, <p>Compared to how 'extravagant' the 'tapping' was in contrast to how I had taken the drink away from him, it was only natural that he didn't take it into consideration.</p>, <p>I had purposely diverted his attention away with my actions to make it slip his mind.</p>, <p>Sort of like how most magicians trick their audience in shows.</p>, <p> Only that, I was no magician.</p>, <p>\"Huuu...\"</p>, <p>I took a breath as I finally finished the drink in my hand and placed it down on the table again.</p>, <p>Even now, as I stared at it, I could see it trembling.

Her thoughts were in disarray, but she didn't show it outwardly.</p>, <p>All she could think of at the moment was Julien.</p>, <p>'Why...? Why did he do that?'</p>, <p>For what reason did he go out of his way to help her? It made no sense to her. It couldn't be because he still cared about her, right?</p>, <p>Evelyn swallowed and pursed her lips.</p>, <p>The idea seemed impossible, and she knew herself that it was impossible, and yet... Why did she continue to have such thoughts?</p>, <p>It was obvious why.</p>, <p>....It was because that was what she'd liked to believe. That perhaps, he wasn't the heartless monster that she had seen. That there was perhaps still something in his broken self.</p>, <p>Something that could still be salvaged.</p>, <p>\"Evelyn?\"</p>, <p>Her thoughts were broken by a quiet voice. When she turned around, Leon appeared, standing beside her.</p>, <p>He stood quietly with his gaze fixed on her.</p>, <p>\".....Are you okay?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Evelyn opened her mouth but found herself unable to say anything. She eventually lowered her head and nodded her head.</p>, <p>'I'm fine.'</p>, <p>Was what she was trying to imply with her actions.</p>, <p>Her odd behaviour didn't go unnoticed by Leon, who frowned at the sight of her and leaned his head forward.</p>, <p>\"What happened...?\"</p>, <p>\"No, it's—\"</p>, <p>\"What happened.\"</p>, <p>He cut her off decisively, leaving her with no room to say anything else. It was at that moment that Evelyn realized she couldn't fool him and bitterly smiled.</p>, <p>\"It's Julien...\"</p>, <p>She spoke slowly, keeping her head down.</p>, <p>\"Do you think he can be saved?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Her response was met with silence. When she looked up, she was surprised to see Leon staring at her with a complicated expression.</p>, <p>Then, with a long sigh, he shook his head.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>He decisively said. Almost too decisively.</p>, <p>\".....He can no longer be saved.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn felt a little part of her tear. Especially when she noticed the strained expression on Leon's face as he talked about him.</p>, <p>\"....It's too late for that. The Julien you remember. That we remember. He's no longer in this world.\"</p>, <p>He paused before adding.</p>, <p>\"Think of him as a stranger.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>After another half hour elapsed and the guests' patience wore thin, the Head Chief decided to halt the investigation.</p>, <p>\"It appears we've detained you all for too long. My apologies for the inconvenience. Regrettably, we couldn't identify the culprit.\"</p>, <p>He announced, maintaining his professional demeanour.</p>, <p>With a slight bow, he went on to add,</p>, <p>\"As a token of apology, for all the guests that were inconvenienced by our actions, the auction will offer a 10% discount on any of the products available from us.\"</p>, <p>Only then did the people in the hall calm down. It had to be noted that a ten percent discount was a large sum of money given how expensive some of the items listed in the auction house were.</p>, <p>Such a reward was enough to wash all pent-up resentment away.</p>, <p>It was a small price the Head Chief was willing to pay in order to keep the people in the hall happy. A smile marred his features when he saw the pleased expressions of the guests, and only then did he finally allow for the guests to be escorted out of the premise.</p>, <p>\"Though the circumstances made the night sour, I hope you have all enjoyed yourselves. Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience.\"</p>, <p>One by one, the guests started to move out in an orderly line.</p>, <p>As the guests departed in an orderly procession, a man clad in a butler uniform joined the line, then discreetly veered off into a dim corridor.</p>, <p>Tok Tok—</p>, <p>His steps echoed throughout the otherwise quiet corridor as his calm expression changed.</p>, <p>\".....Failed.\"</p>, <p>The plan had failed.</p>, <p>The butler's expression distorted at the thought.

I thought I'd be able to find some clues regarding the situation, and some items that I could use, but when thinking about it, he wasn't even a superhuman.</p>, <p>Why would he have anything on him?</p>, <p>Plus, we had all been checked beforehand, there was simply no way he'd have anything of value on him.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Once again, silence gripped my surroundings.</p>, <p>I stared at the body in front of me for a few seconds before flipping it over.</p>, <p>My hands twitched and I felt my knee shake a little. But... I ignored the weird sensations and brought my hand toward his throat.</p>, <p>I felt his throat at my hands. It was large, and I felt my heart race. Adrenaline was coursing down my body, and my hands felt tingly.</p>, <p>The next thing I knew, I was squeezing.</p>, <p>\"Kh...\"</p>, <p>I squeezed as tightly as I could.</p>, <p>He was dead.</p>, <p>The notifications suggested it. But...</p>, <p>I didn't trust it.</p>, <p>I wanted to make sure that was the case.</p>, <p>What if he was using some sort of ability to make himself look dead...?</p>, <p>.....I couldn't allow even the slightest chance of that happening.</p>, <p>Therefore, even as my stomach churned and I felt disgusted by my actions, I increased my grip on his throat.</p>, <p>\"Kh.\"</p>, <p>Despite doing the choking, it felt as if I was the one being choked.</p>, <p>I felt suffocated and at some point, my hands started to tremble.</p>, <p>But I persisted...</p>, <p>In the silence, I continued to press my hands over his neck and squeezed with everything that I had.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>By the time that I stopped, my breathing was rough.</p>, <p>I knew that I didn't have much time left and that I needed to leave. Given the circumstances, there were bound to be people coming soon. Thankfully, with everyone having moved toward the main hall after the incident, the area was still somewhat deserted.</p>, <p>\"Huuu...\"</p>, <p>Recomposing myself, I stood up and fixed my clothes. The entire time I kept my eyes lingering on the corpse.</p>, <p>If he wasn't dead before, I was sure he was now.</p>, <p>I imprinted the sight in my mind.</p>, <p>\"I killed him.\"</p>, <p>I told myself that.</p>, <p>It wasn't going to be the last time I would kill someone.</p>, <p>That much I knew, and understood.</p>, <p>Which was why I burned the image and emotions I was currently feeling in my mind. Once again, I reminded myself of my new identity and situation.</p>, <p>Slap--</p>, <p>I slapped myself once in the face to remind myself of that fact.</p>, <p>Only then did I calm down. I was just about to stand up when I noticed something and squinted my eyes. It was dark so I couldn't see properly.</p>, <p>But there was something that grabbed my attention.</p>, <p>I slowly rolled up the butler's sleeve to get a better look. When I did, my eyes widened and my heart, which had just steadied, jumped up.</p>, <p>A familiar tattoo. One that I had.</p>, <p>Four identical leaves.</p>, <p>All in black.</p>, <p>\"What is...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The journey back to Haven felt like a blur. None of the cadets spoke throughout the entire way back, and the Professor was busy handling reports and calls from the other Professor at the Academy to care about us.</p>, <p>I was fine with such development.</p>, <p>I was in no state to talk with anyone. The only thing in my mind was the image of the butler's tattoo.</p>, <p>Rolling up my sleeves, I stared at mine.</p>, <p>It was identical in every way. Perhaps, the only difference between my tattoo and theirs was that mine was glowing. At least to me. From an outsider's point of view, mine was also not glowing.</p>, <p>I was the only one that could see the glowing.</p>, <p>'What is the meaning of this....?'</p>, <p>A wave of questions flooded my mind. They just endlessly poured into my mind like the water from a broken dam.</p>, <p>What was the meaning of the tattoo and why did the butler have it? Was it some twisted coincidence and the two did not correlate...?</p>, <p>'As if.'</p>, <p>I wasn't naive enough to think that.</p>, <p>There was something more to it. I was sure.</p>, <p>'....But what exactly?'</p>, <p>He had died before I could find any information. I had been so shocked by the development that I had only snapped out of it when I heard the sound of footsteps coming from behind me.</p>, <p>Only then did I wake up and hide the body away before joining back with the group.</p>, <p>Thankfully, nobody asked about my whereabouts when I returned. I had only been gone for less than five minutes. It wasn't suspicious enough to gather their interest.</p>, <p>....And in some way, most didn't have the courage to ask. Most weren't on good enough terms with me.</p>, <p>I guess there were perks to being anti-social.</p>, <p>Still...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I once again stared at my forearm.</p>, <p>My thoughts kept wandering back toward the tattoo. Just what connection does it have with the one that I have?</p>, <p>It felt as though I had finally found something. An idea to chase after. Only for me to find that the path was just as dark as the other ones that I had been following.</p>, <p>'Just how would I be ab--Ah.'</p>, <p>It was at that moment that I recalled something.</p>, <p>A certain conversation I had a while back. In fact, there was someone else that knew about the tattoo. Or had asked me about it.</p>, <p>I hadn't thought much about it back then but...</p>, <p>'Delilah.'</p>, <p>.....She definitely knew something.</p>, <p>What if...?</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Tok Tok--</p>, <p>Calm and even steps.</p>, <p>They moved toward a small building where several people were gathered. All eyes fell on the dark robed man as he entered and took off his top-hat. Their expressions immediately shifted, and they all lowered their heads to address him respectfully.</p>, <p>\"Inquisitor Hallowe.\"</p>, <p>\"....Inquisitor.\"</p>, <p>But he paid them no attention. His eyes fell on the naked corpse that lay in the middle of the table.</p>, <p>A middle-aged man wearing formal attire stepped up to explain.</p>, <p>\"....We've found him like this after the guests were all let out. We believe it to have happened in less than five minutes after we let them out. We were only able to find the corpse after one of our staff went in to clear the rooms.\"</p>, <p>He then went on to point toward the neck of the perpetrator.</p>, <p>\"If you look at his neck, we believe that he died from strangling.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Yet again, the Inquisitor remained silent. He inched closer to the naked corpse in front of him and placed his hand over its chest.</p>, <p>\"Inquisitor?\"</p>, <p>Just when the others were questioning his actions, he finally spoke.</p>, <p>\"He didn't die due to suffocation.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh? But--\"</p>, <p>He tilted his head and frowned.</p>, <p>\"I sense traces of curse magic. Faint, but I can sense them.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>\"But even that isn't enough to kill him. They're too faint. A low Tier mage.\"</p>, <p>A picture of the scene replayed in the Inquisitor's mind. It was a scene he more or less was certain of.</p>, <p>He went on to open the eyes of the corpse before nodding.</p>, <p>\"This guy killed himself.\"</p>, <p>\"Killed himself?!\"</p>, <p>\"What? But...!\"</p>, <p>His conclusion drew the shock of all those present, but as the Inquisitor's eyes wandered to the forearm of the victim, his expression changed slightly.</p>, <p>\"Yes, he killed himself.\"</p>, <p>He was even more sure of it now.</p>, <p>The picture in his mind became clearer.</p>, <p>\"Curse magic was used to detain him. However, before he could get anything answered, this guy killed himself. The strangling is probably something that was done to make sure he was dead. Quite meticulous.\"</p>, <p>A subtle praise. But that was all. He shifted his eyes away from the corpse and turned around.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? Inquisitor?\"</p>, <p>\"My job is done here. I more or less understand what happened.\"</p>, <p>\"....But what about the thief?\"</p>, <p>\"Thief?\"</p>, <p> The Inquisitor blinked. Then, recalling the information he received from 'Central' he subtly smacked his forehead.</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>He pointed at the corpse.</p>, <p>\"It's probably him.\"</p>, <p>Before the people present in the room could even say anything back, he put his hat back on and pulled the door open.</p>, <p>\"If you would excuse me. I have a place to be.\"</p>, <p>A place he looked forward to visiting. An interesting place.</p>, <p>He stepped outside of the premises.</p>, <p>Just before leaving, he left a few last words.</p>, <p>\"Well... Probably?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was the next day and I came out of the bathroom holding onto a familiar-looking orb.</p>, <p>I set it down on the desk and sat on a chair where I took a book and opened it. For now, I decided to set aside the problem regarding the tattoo on my hand.</p>, <p>While there was indeed a chance that Delilah knew about my situation...</p>, <p>\"No, she probably knows.\"</p>, <p>It made no sense for someone as powerful as her not to know about such an organization. It was probably why she had mentioned my tattoo back then.</p>, <p>If I were to ask she'd probably be able to give me an answer, but...</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>I suddenly laughed.</p>, <p>Leaning back on my chair, a few things made sense to me.</p>, <p>\"....So that's why she made me her assistant.\"</p>, <p>It wasn't because I was weak or whatever excuse she had told me back then.</p>, <p>Far from it.</p>, <p>\"She wants to monitor me.\"</p>, <p>That much became clear to me after thinking about the situation. This tattoo I had... While there was a chance that I was wrong, I was inclined to believe that my deduction was correct.</p>, <p>Now that brought rise to several more questions.</p>, <p>How much did she know? What sort of organization was this? Did she think I was part of that organization? If so, is she my ally or enemy?</p>, <p>\"...How troublesome.\"</p>, <p>My head throbbed the more I thought about the matter.</p>, <p>The situation became even more complicated. Another reason why I decided to hold off on meeting her.</p>, <p>Until I knew what her stance was, I planned on taking my time to observe the situation.</p>, <p>\"Haa.\"</p>, <p>I shifted my attention toward the book in my hand, [Bone Classification and their usage]. It was a book that was given to us as part of our course selection.</p>, <p>That turned out for the best since borrowing from the library would've been problematic.</p>, <p>Especially if someone came to investigate the Academy and found that right after coming back from the Auction the first thing I did was research bones.</p>, <p>Talk about suspicious.</p>, <p>Flip--</p>, <p>I flipped through the pages of the book and started to read. I knew the general information, but that wasn't enough. I needed to know more.</p>, <p>Which was what I did.</p>, <p>[Introduction: Dimensional bones and their usages]</p>, <p>There were three sections in the table of contents. Ranks and classifications, usage and integration, and types.</p>, <p>For the next hour or so I absorbed all the information in the book before finally summarizing all the information in my mind.</p>, <p>\"Hu.\"</p>, <p>I took a pen and jotted everything down.</p>, <p>: Ranks. Bones were ranked based on the rank of the originating monster. An infant rank monster produced an infant rank bone and so on. Primordial ranked monsters existed, but no such bone had ever been found. The greater the strength of the monster, the more powerful the ability.</p>, <p>: Types. The human body could only accept a maximum of five bones and once integrated couldn't be taken out. Any more and the body would break down. There were only seven types of bones that could be integrated into the human body: Skull Bone, Rib Bone, Ulna Bone, Femur Bone, Pelvis Bone, Vertebrae Bone, and lastly Mandible Bone.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>My pen stopped there and I shifted my attention toward the orb on my side.</p>, <p>Lastly, integration.</p>, <p>\"This way, right?\"</p>, <p>I pinched the orb in between my fingers and channeled my mana into it. The orb glowed a white hue as the room turned bright all of a sudden.</p>, <p>A magic circle floated in the air. It lasted several seconds before shattering.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>Thud!</p>, <p>A long black bone fell onto the table with a dull 'thud'.</p>, <p>\"....No wonder it looked so small.\"</p>, <p>In reality, it was merely a container for the actual bone which was about the size of my thigh.</p>, <p>I carefully observed the bone in front of me and stepped back. There was a certain aura that radiated from it that made me feel uncomfortable. It made my face winch. Not only that, but the smell it gave out was also anything but pleasing.</p>, <p>Still, after a careful look, I was able to understand what bone it was.</p>, <p>\"The right Ulna.\"</p>, <p>The bone right beneath the forearm.</p>, <p>\".....The rank also seems to be Junior Rank.\"</p>, <p>The bone belonged to a Metryl which was typically known to be a Junior-ranked monster. Even if it wasn't, the book stated that bones from Terror rank and up glowed and were extremely mana-dense.</p>, <p>This one wasn't so it was fair to assume it was a Junion Rank bone. Maybe Infant, but I doubted it was given the price.</p>, <p>\"For a Junior Rank bone to be this expensive...\"</p>, <p>Just how ludicrous were the prices for higher-ranked bones? The thought made me want to puke.</p>, <p>I really needed to find a way to make more money.</p>, <p>My progress would surely increase then.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath and reached out for the bone. The steps for integration were rather straightforward.</p>, <p>Place the bone on the respective area and create a mana flow between the two.</p>, <p>While I understood the principle behind the integration, I wasn't exactly confident I could pull it off.</p>, <p>I still tried nonetheless.</p>, <p>I followed the usual steps. Focusing my attention on my core, a certain warmth invaded my body.</p>, <p>I guided it toward the bone in my grasp.</p>, <p>\"Hm.\"</p>, <p>I felt my brows furrow.</p>, <p>There was a little resistance from the bone at first, but with the passing of seconds, it started to accept my mana.</p>, <p>The first step that I needed to do was 'Assimilation'. In short, I needed to get the bone used to my mana. This was a necessary step before the 'Integration' part.</p>, <p>So I decided to be patient. This wasn't going to be an easy step.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I was right.</p>, <p>The 'Assimilation' process was taking a little longer than I expected.</p>, <p>However, as I glanced at the clock, I smiled.</p>, <p>It was Sunday.</p>, <p>I had all the time in the world.</p>, <p>In total, it took about thirty more minutes for me to finally be able to smoothly channel my mana into the bone.</p>, <p>\"...Hah.\"</p>, <p>As soon as I reached that stage, I let out the breath I held in. It was now time for me to move toward the most important part.</p>, <p>\"Integration.\"</p>, <p>This process was also not very complicated. However, the book described this next stage as the hardest. Not because it was hard to do, but because of the pain one would experience during the integration.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that the Institute tested one's pain tolerance.</p>, <p>Unless one reached a score of three, they wouldn't allow any of the cadets to try to integrate with a bone without any assistance.</p>, <p>But to me...</p>, <p>That didn't matter. Three, four, five, six... So long as my body didn't fail me, it was nothing.</p>, <p>Pain... It was something I could deal with.</p>, <p>So.</p>, <p>I didn't hesitate with the next step.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>The bone stuck to my forearm and an excruciating pain invaded my body.</p>, <p>The pain was hard to describe.</p>, <p>It felt as if the bones on my forearm had gotten crushed by a large boulder as it fell. The muscles twisted and squirmed as a result, and the bone attached itself to my skin.</p>, <p>Creak...! Crack...!</p>, <p>The sounds that came out of my forearm were all for me to hear.</p>, <p>My lips trembled and my heart squirmed in pain.</p>, <p>The pain was something that I could vividly feel in my mind.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>Even while getting baptized by this intense pain, I didn't let out a single sound. I simply refused to yield to the pain.</p>, <p>Pain.</p>, <p>It meant a lot to me.</p>, <p>Having experienced it so much, I knew all sorts of pains. And... screaming from this type of pain felt pathetic.</p>, <p>'There's worse. This is nothing.'</p>, <p>So.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence and watched as my forearm squirmed and spasmed.</p>, <p>Creak...! Crack...!</p>, <p>The sounds continued but nothing came out of my mouth. I wouldn't let myself let anything out.</p>, <p>Such pain continued for the next hour.</p>, <p>The entire time I stood motionless and took in the pain.</p>, <p>Memorized it.</p>, <p>....So that the next time I experienced something similar, I could tell myself, 'I withstood this, why can't I withstand this?'</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>Snap--!</p>, <p>As I heard a loud snapping sound, a sense of weakness finally hit me.</p>, <p>I stumbled several steps back before falling onto my chair.</p>, <p>The world spun and the edges of my vision started to become dark. Gradually, the darkness spread, reaching down from all areas before finally taking away my sight.</p>, <p>Even in such a state, I remained silent.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I felt my right arm twitch and something came out.</p>, <p>I wasn't sure what.</p>, <p>I couldn't see.</p>, <p>It took several minutes for my vision to return.</p>, <p>When it did, I stared around me.</p>, <p>All I saw were...</p>, <p>\".....Threads.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>\".....You want to team up with me?\"</p>, <p>I was somewhat confused by the sudden proposal. Of all people, I didn't expect Leon to be the one suggesting this.</p>, <p>He was the one who usually avoided me when he could. Why the sudden change of heart?</p>, <p>That was unless...</p>, <p>\"You need something from me?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>He remained silent but that was all I needed to hear.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Which was why I rejected him.</p>, <p>I planned to make use of the time to practice my skills and train. I had no time for distractions.</p>, <p>I thought that my message was clear, but just as I prepared to leave, Leon spoke.</p>, <p>\".....It'll be beneficial for you too.\"</p>, <p>That's when my steps paused.</p>, <p>Beneficial for me too?</p>, <p>Suddenly, I recalled something; 'The game is called Rise of the Three Calamities, and the main character is called Leon'</p>, <p>They were my brother's words before my death.</p>, <p>Ah--</p>, <p>It then clicked to me.</p>, <p>This person was the main character. He was the character that the world was centered around. It didn't feel that way to me because I had been so focused on myself, but such was the reality of the situation.</p>, <p>While his presence brought a lot of danger, it also brought a lot of opportunity.</p>, <p>'I may be taking this opportunity from other characters, but I don't particularly care...'</p>, <p>To begin with, I didn't know the plot of the game.</p>, <p>Whether I changed the plot or not, I didn't care.</p>, <p>'Hmm, but maybe I should...'</p>, <p>Would this affect the events that the quest window would display?....Or would the quests adjust to the situation?</p>, <p>It was certainly something to think about, but it didn't weigh heavily on my mind.</p>, <p>If there was an opportunity, then I didn't plan on missing it. Even if it ended up screwing with whatever event that was going to happen in the future I wasn't sure existed.</p>, <p>So...</p>, <p>I turned around to look at Leon.</p>, <p>\"I'll listen. What sort of opportunity are you talking about....?\"</p>, <p>Whether it screwed with the future or not, I didn't care.</p>, <p>I didn't live for the unknown future.</p>, <p>I lived for the present.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Leon stared at Julien's back as it disappeared into the crack. Shortly after he left, a figure walked up from behind him.</p>, <p> \"....Did he accept?\"</p>, <p>It was none other than Aoife. Behind her were four other people. Of which, Leon only managed to recognize Evelyn and Luxon.</p>, <p>\"He said he wanted a few days to himself.\"</p>, <p>\"A few days to himself?\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned, but before she could say anything, Leon cut in.</p>, <p>\"I accepted.\"</p>, <p>\"....Hm?\"</p>, <p>Aoife's eyebrows jumped a little but they soon recovered.</p>, <p>\"Are you sure?\"</p>, <p>\"...Sure.\"</p>, <p>The conversation was supposed to end there, but a figure with long black hair jumped in on the conversation.</p>, <p>\"Is it really a good idea to invite him?\"</p>, <p>Leon looked towards him.</p>, <p>Wesley Montague. One of the top rankers within the year. He was ranked within the top 10 the last time Leon recalled.</p>, <p>But as Leon stared at him, he felt himself grow uncomfortable.</p>, <p>He couldn't quite put it, but...</p>, <p>'I don't like him.'</p>, <p>There was something about him that felt off to Leon.</p>, <p>Still, considering that he had been chosen for the team, he pushed his feelings aside and asked,</p>, <p>\"Why do you think so?\"</p>, <p>\"Don't get me wrong. He is strong. However, he will be a burden to us. Monsters don't have emotions and without emotions...\"</p>, <p>Wesley ended his sentence there but the meaning behind his words was clear for everyone to understand.</p>, <p>Leon looked back to see the reaction of the other group members. Besides Aoife who seemed unsure, and Evelyn who seemed confused, they all shared the same opinion as Wesley.</p>, <p>Leon sighed.</p>, <p>Not because he didn't understand where they were coming from, but because his 'instincts' told him otherwise.</p>, <p>That...</p>, <p>If he didn't bring him, he'd regret it.</p>, <p>But how could he explain this to them? In the end, frowning, Leon looked at Wesley and answered.</p>, <p>\"....Whether he'll be of use or not, we'll see later. For now, we will wait.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>\"Ah... Tsk.\"</p>, <p>I stood up and clicked my tongue.</p>, <p>\"...Another fail.\"</p>, <p>Extending my hand, I withdrew the thread that extended from out of my forearm. I then sat in silence and stared at the distant creature running away from the area.</p>, <p>It had been two hours since I had left the supply station at the Academy gate's entrance.</p>, <p>\"I don't have much time.\"</p>, <p>My appointment with Leon was set for exactly three days, Zone [F].</p>, <p>With our expedition lasting for about a week, three days was plenty of time for me to train and improve.</p>, <p>The Black Region was split into 7 different zones which went from [A] to [G]. Each Zone contained a different environment and habitat.</p>, <p>I was currently in Zone [A].</p>, <p>The safest of all the seven zones.</p>, <p>Such was my current limit. Besides my new ability and curse magic, I was practically defenseless against the monsters.</p>, <p>I had no choice but to go to the safest zone.</p>, <p>\"Thankfully, I'm not as helpless now...\"</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>A thread coiled down from my forearm, slowly crawling toward the cracks of the rocky surface beneath. I used my mind to carefully guide the thread around the cracks and towards the distance where a furry creature stood.</p>, <p>'Aurorahemoth'</p>, <p>Such was the name of the creature I was currently hunting.</p>, <p>Despite its name, it was one of the weakest creatures found within the Mirror Dimension. With its tiny body and short limbs, it was essentially a standing target. It bore a resemblance to a rabbit but it was a lot more grotesque in appearance.</p>, <p>With its mouth split into four sections, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth that twisted within its gaping maw, it was anything but cute.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>\".....I missed.\"</p>, <p>Regardless of how much I tried, just when the thread would reach a certain distance, it would detect it and hop away.</p>, <p>\"How troublesome.\"</p>, <p>I wasn't disheartened by the failure.</p>, <p>Though I kept on failing, I was getting closer and closer to the creature with each attempt. That wasn't all. I could feel my control over the thread to be smoother with each attempt.</p>, <p>This was a great experience, but...</p>, <p>\"Still too slow.\"</p>, <p>The rate of progress was nice, but I was still not satisfied.</p>, <p>I sat down on a nearby rock and stared into the sky. It was gray, and a white sun hung in the distance. The air was dry, and there was hardly any vegetation around me.</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and let my mana course through my body before agglomerating towards the tip of my fingers.</p>, <p>Rune One--Rune Two--Rune Three--Rune Four--Rune Five--Rune Six--Rune Seven--Rune Eight--Rune Nine--Rune Ten--Rune Eleven....</p>, <p>Tzzz--</p>, <p>A familiar sound.</p>, <p>Opening my eyes, I pursed my lips.</p>, <p>\".....That failed too.\"</p>, <p>Nothing seemed to be going right for me. [Chains of Alakantria]. I was still struggling to unlock this spell.</p>, <p>It was frustrating, but I had become numb to the sense of frustration.</p>, <p>All I felt was frustration.</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>As a hollow laugh escaped from my lips, I directed my attention toward the distance where another creature greeted my sight.</p>, <p>I looked toward my arm and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>Immediately, a thread coiled out of my forearm, coiling around my hand and splitting into five different threads.</p>, <p>Drip...</p>, <p>Sweat trickled down the side of my face the moment I split the threads.</p>, <p>Accompanying the pain was a sharp pain. Having to split my attention five different ways was quite exhausting.</p>, <p>Ignoring my eyelid which was twitching, I guided the five threads towards the creature in the distance.</p>, <p>The distance between the creature and the creature shrank.</p>, <p>Ten meters...</p>, <p>Nine meters...</p>, <p>Eight meters....</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>Sweat continued to pour down from my face as my right eyelid twitched. The pain in my head intensified, and my jaw clicked.</p>, <p>Even so, I persisted and separated the threads.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I forced myself to suffer in silence as the threads split.</p>, <p>Biting my lips, I imprinted the sight ahead in my mind. Then, closing my eyes and letting darkness embrace my vision, I envisioned a path for the threads which were the only things that appeared in my darkened vision.</p>, <p>Like snakes, they coiled around the ground and neared the creature.</p>, <p>Seven meters...</p>, <p>Six meters...</p>, <p>Five meters...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I stopped right there and opened my eyes.</p>, <p>The creature's ears perked up as its head raised to look around. Clearly, it had detected something but couldn't understand what.</p>, <p>\"Five meters...\"</p>, <p>That was my current limit.</p>, <p>My finger twitched. One of the threads lunged forward. As if expecting such action, the creature jumped ahead.</p>, <p>Swoosh--</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Hiek!\"</p>, <p>It was surrounded.</p>, <p>\"Kh.\"</p>, <p>My hand clenched tightly, urging the threads into action as they surged towards the creature.</p>, <p>This time, there was no avenue of escape. With every path blocked and suspended mid-air, the creature could only observe helplessly as the threads ensnared its body, coiling around its limbs.</p>, <p>\"....Hah.\"</p>, <p>I watched from the distance as the pain in my mind intensified. However, I ignored the pain and smiled.</p>, <p>\"I did it.\"</p>, <p>A wave of relief washed over me as my chest trembled.</p>, <p>\"Hieek--!\"</p>, <p>The creature continued to trash in the distance as the threads coiled around it. I was just about to put it out of its misery when I frowned.</p>, <p>\"Hm.\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, I felt multiple pairs of eyes falling on me.</p>, <p>When I turned around, I felt my body freeze. Tens of different pairs of eyes were staring at me. Their expressions were anything but friendly.</p>, <p>I didn't let myself fall into panic and took a deep breath.</p>, <p>The Professor had warned beforehand that there was a likelihood of such a scenario occurring. It was for this reason that I wasn't panicked.</p>, <p>Furthermore, Aurorahemoth's weren't known for their speed.</p>, <p>'I'll probably be able to run away if I want to.'</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth.</p>, <p>For what reason did I need to run away? If I couldn't even handle such weak creatures then how was I supposed to get stronger?</p>, <p>I smacked the side of my head and took another deep breath.</p>, <p>\"Right, whatever...\"</p>, <p>\"Hieek--!\"</p>, <p>Clenching my hand, the creature in the distance split into ten different pieces.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>The sudden notification that flashed before my very eyes took me by surprise. However, taking note of the advancing creatures, I put it to the side and recalled the threads back to me.</p>, <p>This was probably going to hurt, but...</p>, <p>\"Come.\"</p>]\n",

And while I could withstand pain, I didn't like pain.</p>, <p>If possible, I wanted to avoid it.</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>I continued to avoid the incoming attacks while focusing on the threads coming out of my arm.

That was what I told myself.</p>, <p>The truth was probably different, but it was something that I had to do. It was the only way I could've envisioned myself winning.</p>, <p>While I could've used [Hands of Malady], it wasn't a great skill when facing against fifteen different opponents.</p>, <p>By the time I incapacitated two to three Aurorahemoths, I'd already be out of mana.</p>, <p>Such was why I had no choice but to use my body as bait.</p>, <p>It hurt...</p>, <p>\"But it worked.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I reached out for my bag and took out several ointments which I placed over my wounds.</p>, <p>Thankfully, they were merely superficial wounds.</p>, <p>A little deep, but still manageable.</p>, <p>\"....They should heal in a couple of hours.\"</p>, <p>Such was the magic of the ointments of this world.</p>, <p>While I waited for my wounds to heal, I reflected on the fight I just had.</p>, <p>It was pathetic.</p>, <p>I was pathetic.</p>, <p>This wasn't the way that I wanted to win.

I brought my hand forward where a thread slowly moved out from my forearm, coiling around my middle finger.</p>, <p>A purple magic circle soon manifested over my hand.</p>, <p>It hovered around it before shrinking down. Typically, it would trace a downward path, enveloping my entire hand and casting it in a purple hue. This time, however, I changed things up.</p>, <p>I focused my intent away from my hand and toward the thread.</p>, <p>The circle shrinked and moved down my finger.</p>, <p>Sweat started to accumulate down the side of my face as I focused my attention on the circle hovering over my finger.</p>, <p>It gradually inched closer down, reaching the tip of my finger.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>My heart sped at the sight before me.</p>, <p>It was hard to see given how thin the thread was, but it was gradually turning purple.</p>, <p>My eyes widened at the sight.</p>, <p>\"Can it really...\"</p>, <p>I felt my heart beat faster than before. I felt a strange sense of excitement and nervously swallowed my saliva.</p>, <p>The circle inched further down.</p>, <p>It was now halfway down my finger. The thread turned purple for each part the circle passed.</p>, <p>Even more sweat trickled down the side of my face as I maximized my focus.</p>, <p>I was close...</p>, <p>So very close.</p>, <p>....And just as the circle continued to move down, I suddenly frowned.</p>, <p>The magic circle stopped.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>I voluntarily shattered the circle.</p>, <p>That was because I realized I was doing things wrong.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stood there in silence to collect my breath and mana again. Then, I extended my hand forward and a magic circle again formed. Just like last time, it shrunk and hovered over my middle finger.</p>, <p>This time, I didn't let it move down.</p>, <p>Rather...</p>, <p>Swoosh—</p>, <p>I guided the thread out and into the magic circle.</p>, <p>\".....As expected.\"</p>, <p>The thread changed color and my mana expenditure significantly reduced.

It covered a massive expanse of land, its size rivaling, if not surpassing, those of the entire Empire, which itself occupied a substantial portion of the world.</p>, <p>The Black Region was regarded as the smallest among all the regions. Considering the difficulty in conquering even a small portion of this dimension, its status as the smallest seemed only fitting.</p>, <p>Typically, when entering the Black Region, most cadets jumped at the opportunity to go toward the more dangerous regions.</p>, <p>Such was the best place to train.</p>, <p>However, there were a few who preferred to start in the lowest zone to get accustomed to the environment and monsters.</p>, <p>Swooosh—!</p>, <p>\"Ah, fucking hell....\"</p>, <p>Kiera was one such cadet.</p>, <p>Staring at the numerous burning corpses in front of her, she pressed her finger against her ear. It was still ringing.</p>, <p>\"....Fuck, I can't hear shit.\"</p>, <p>No, she could, but it was just a constant ring.</p>, <p>The more it continued, the more she got annoyed. Especially when she noticed two more headed her way.</p>, <p>\"Tsk… How much do these fuckers reproduce? They're endless.\"</p>, <p>A red magic circle hovered over her hand as the two creatures caught fire in the distance. They shrieked in pain, but Kiera had none of that.</p>, <p>\"…Agh, fuck. Is that how it is? Are you all so good at screaming because you mate so much?\"</p>, <p>Just when she thought she was done, another one appeared.</p>, <p>Her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"My word. They really can't stop fucking…\"</p>, <p>In the end, after dispatching the creature, she decided to leave. The creatures, while easy, were hard to handle when in groups of more than five. She doubted anyone would have a hard time handling them en masse.</p>, <p>Packing up her staff, she slung her bag over her shoulder and headed out toward the next region.</p>, <p>The route wasn't far. It was about an hour's walk according to the map.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She was halfway there when she suddenly paused.</p>, <p>From the peripheral of her eyes, she caught something in the distance.</p>, <p>Something felt off.</p>, <p>No, it was off.</p>, <p>Her head turned to face the distance and her expression finally changed.</p>, <p>\"What is...\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened considerably and her bag fell on the floor.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>Off into the distance, she could see the mutilated bodies of over several dozen Aurorahemoth's.

An arrow?</p>, <p>For the cuts to be so clean...</p>, <p>\"Leon?\"</p>, <p>A name popped up in her mind.</p>, <p>He appeared to be the only person capable of such a feat.</p>, <p>Kiera meticulously examined the corpses in front of her.

In their view lay a luminescent forest, emitting a deep blue glow that starkly contrasted with the dull grayness of the surrounding world.

When he looked back, Wesley, who was similarly leaning against a nearby tree, frowned.</p>, <p>\"It's been an hour since we arrived here and he's still not here. Are we sure he's coming?\"</p>, <p>Leon frowned but still answered.</p>, <p>\".....He should be coming.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, well, if you say so.\"</p>, <p>Leon thought he'd leave it at that, but he suddenly continued.</p>, <p>\"You don't think anything happened to him on the way?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"I mean, he did go by himself. And like I said, he's not very strong. It wouldn't be out of the question.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"What if he got hurt and can't make it? How much longer should we wait for?\"</p>, <p>'He talks too much.'</p>, <p>It was starting to become more and more apparent to Leon. This hadn't been the first remark he had made toward Julien.</p>, <p>For the past three days, he had been throwing random jabs at him.</p>, <p>Nobody said a thing considering that they were a group and none of the group members had anything to say about him.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p> It was starting to grow on Leon's nerves.</p>, <p>\"You, c—\"</p>, <p>Rustle—</p>, <p>A gentle rustle halted Leon mid-sentence as he turned his head in the direction of where the sound came from.</p>, <p>Then, a figure slowly emerged from the other side of the trees.</p>, <p>\"This...\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>The moment he appeared, the expressions of all those present changed. This was especially so for Wesley who couldn't help but cover his mouth.</p>, <p>\"Pftt. \"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A weird mixture of expressions greeted my sight the moment I managed to clear the forest and arrive at the meeting area.</p>, <p>I couldn't blame them.</p>, <p>While I wasn't injured, my clothes were a mess with tears all over the place. Dry blood stained my attire, adding to the disarray.</p>, <p>I had been so immersed in my training that I had almost forgotten about the meeting.</p>, <p>Thankfully, I managed to make it in time.</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>A certain sound caught my attention and when I looked up, I found someone staring at with me a look of mockery.</p>, <p>'Who is this guy?'</p>, <p>With long black hair, hazel eyes, and handsome features, he appeared somewhat familiar, but I couldn't quite put it where.</p>, <p>\"You're here.\"</p>, <p>My attention shifted away when I noticed Leon approach me.</p>, <p>He sported a small frown on his face but didn't say anything about my clothing and started to brief me on the situation.</p>, <p>\"Near here there's a Nyxfernal nest.\"</p>, <p>I raised my brow.</p>, <p>'Nyxfernal nest?'</p>, <p>Having studied the books before coming here, I was well learned on Nyxfernals. They were an underground creature that loved to dig tunnels. Highly toxic, and nimble with sharp claws, they were monsters that the Academy recommended avoiding.</p>, <p>....So why was he telling me this?</p>, <p>\"I've already scouted the area beforehand, and there's only one Junior ranked one. The rest are infant ranked.\"</p>, <p>\"And?\"</p>, <p>\"Within the nest, there is a handful of Lumicore Fungi.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>\"It may not be useful for you, but it can fetch a high price if you were to sell it on the market. If you help us, we will give you a share of the gains.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer immediately. Staring into Leon's eyes for a brief moment, I proceeded to lower my head.</p>, <p>Lumicore Fungi. I knew about them. They weren't exactly useful for me. They were resources more fit for those who practiced the [Body] category.</p>, <p>However, that didn't mean they were worthless.</p>, <p>No, rather, they were worth a lot of money. I wasn't sure exactly how much, but each gram was worth at least multiple dozen Rend.</p>, <p>I was in desperate need of money.</p>, <p>To become stronger faster, I needed more resources. Money was the key to gaining access to such resources.</p>, <p>I had no other choice but to accept.</p>, <p>And when my thoughts paused there, I looked up to Leon and nodded.</p>, <p>\"Alright. I'll accept.\"</p>, <p>Just briefly, I noticed Leon's lips pull up slightly. But it left as fast as it came, and I had a hard time figuring out whether I had seen it wrongly or not.</p>, <p>In the end, I let it be.</p>, <p>\"....Get ready. We will be leaving soon.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>Located deep into the [F] Zone was a certain web of tunnels that one could enter from a few spots above.</p>, <p>Somewhat familiar with the area, Leon guided us toward a dark cave that one couldn't see the end of.</p>, <p>\"Is this the place?\"</p>, <p>Luxon glanced around with a frown.</p>, <p>\"Do we have some light? Or do you-\"</p>, <p>\"There's no need.\"</p>, <p>Leon casually looked back before stepping in.</p>, <p>\"You'll see once we reach deeper inside.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...\"</p>, <p>His figure disappeared into the cave. Aoife followed right after him. Though confused, Luxon sighed and followed right after. I was just about to follow when someone turned to face me.</p>, <p>He appeared friendly.</p>, <p>\"Make sure you stay behind me.\"</p>, <p>\"....?\"</p>, <p>\"I have no idea why Leon wanted you to come, but...\"</p>, <p>He lowered his head to scan my body.</p>, <p>\"....I can protect you if you stay behind me. Since you seem to be struggling so much, I thought it'd be best if you stayed with me. I'm a sharpshooter so I've got great eyesight.\"</p>, <p>What is this guy...</p>, <p>\"If you stay next to me you won't get in the way of others and might even be able to contribute.\"</p>, <p>Every word that he spat was spat with a friendly smile, and yet... All I felt was a strange sense of disgust.</p>, <p>I was just about to respond to him when he turned around and entered the cave.</p>, <p>\"Just make sure you listen to me. It'll do all of us good.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence for a short moment before lowering my head to stare at my hand.</p>, <p>Struggling?....Might be able to contribute?</p>, <p>This...</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>I almost laughed.</p>, <p>What sort of situation was this? I wasn't even mad. I was just baffled. He couldn't even hide his own dislike towards me.</p>, <p>I shook my head.</p>, <p>I had thought people would finally leave me alone after what I had done, but there were still a few who were not convinced.</p>, <p>Most likely, he had some basis behind his confidence. Given that I could somewhat recognize him, he must've had some strength to back up his confidence.</p>, <p>Still...</p>, <p>\"What a pain.\"</p>, <p>Just when was it going to be enough?</p>, <p>Scratching the side of my head, I entered the cave and embraced the darkness. I had just taken several steps when I stopped.</p>, <p>The air was thick with the scent of earth and dampness, and the sound of dripping water echoed softly in the distance.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>However, off in the distance I took notice of a strange glow.</p>, <p>I didn't hesitate to follow the light and soon enough I was left shocked by the sight that greeted me. Covering the walls and ceiling of the cave was an unusual blue moss, emitting a soft glow that illuminated the entire cavern.</p>, <p>'Wow.'</p>, <p>It looked like a scene straight out of a movie and I had to take a moment to observe the area.</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>I only looked away when I felt someone call my name. Looking up, I saw everyone looking at me. I briefly paused my gaze on the black-haired kid before turning it back to Leon who pressed his hand against his mouth and nudged me forward.</p>, <p>\"We're near the nest so be careful. If you—\"</p>, <p>BOOOM—!</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>The cavern shook all of a sudden. Unable to keep it steady, I lost my footing and fell against the ground.</p>, <p>I was the only one that fell as almost everyone was able to keep their footing.</p>, <p>\"Hiek!\"</p>, <p>Someone else did fall on me as my vision was covered by a set of purple hair.</p>, <p>The moment she fell on me, I felt her body turn rigid and our eyes met. I hardly reacted given that I knew that this was an accident, but she didn't think so as her eyes darted all over the place but me.</p>, <p>Then, just as she was about to say something, I caught sight of a massive figure headed in our direction from the distance and I pushed her off of me.</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>A tremendous pressure that made it hard to breathe emitted from the creature's body as I tried to get my bearings.</p>, <p>Just as I was about to move forward, a hand pushed me back.</p>, <p>\"Don't interfere.\"</p>, <p>\"Get ready!\"</p>, <p>Leon's voice reached me shortly after. With his glowing sword, he pushed his feet forward and dashed forward.</p>, <p>His figure blurred forward as it headed toward the distant creature. Following him right behind was Aoife who was just a tad bit slower.</p>, <p>The others also got into position as they readied themselves to face the creature.</p>, <p>I was the only one who did nothing as I met a pair of hazel eyes.</p>, <p>\"We discussed it before, right? Stay with me so that we don't interfere with them.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Just then, I deeply stared into his eyes. He met them back. As if he was trying to challenge me. However... that didn't last for long.</p>, <p>He soon started to grow uncomfortable with my gaze. So much that his eyes started to dart away from me.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I kept at it until he couldn't bear it anymore and finally looked away.</p>, <p>I knew then the reasoning behind his attitude.</p>, <p>.....He was afraid of me.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>....He was afraid of me?</p>, <p>Was that the case....? I thought so at first, but surely that couldn't be the only reason for his hatred and dislike towards me.</p>, <p>There had to be something else.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Thinking things through I realized that I hadn't exactly been the friendliest of people.</p>, <p>I tended to mind my own business and avoided interacting with others. It was mainly so that my cover wouldn't be blown but at the same time because I didn't want to get attached to anyone.</p>, <p>But still...</p>, <p>For him to be afraid of me. There had to be a more concrete reason.</p>, <p>BOOOM—!</p>, <p>The cave shook as Leon's sword came into contact with Nyxfernal—a large creature with a stout body and thick, fur-covered form. Its sharp claws gleamed under the light from the moss as its small, beady eyes fiercely glared at us.</p>, <p>\"Kh....!\"</p>, <p>Upon coming into contact with the Nyxfernal, Leon's sword ricocheted back. Just as he was about to lose balance, Aoife raised her hand and his body halted mid-air.</p>, <p>\"....Thanks.\"</p>, <p>She followed up with another wave, stopping the beast's claws from slashing at him.</p>, <p>Kacha!</p>, <p>Lighting burst from out of nowhere, landing on the Nyxfernal thick fur. Evelyn, who stood by the side, held both hands forward as her uniform and hair fluttered.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>That too seemed like a futile attempt as Evelyn let out a small curse.</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>\"Let me.\"</p>, <p>A figure rushed the creature. His speed was fast, and within moments, he appeared right beneath the creature's body. Two magic circles formed around his fists as he punched out with everything he had.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>Even that seemed like a meaningless attempt as his fists stopped right after making contact with the creature's underbelly.</p>, <p>Luxon immediately panicked as he looked behind.</p>, <p>\"Shit, Aoife! Save me....!\"</p>, <p>Just as he said those words, the Nyxfernal's body flexed and its tail swung right at Luxon who crossed his arms to brace for impact.</p>, <p>Thankfully, Aoife was quick enough to react as she pulled him back just in time to avoid the attack.</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>The cave shook even more fiercely as Luxon skidded several meters back.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaaa... Thanks.\"</p>, <p>\"Try again.\"</p>, <p>With cold focus, Aoife lifted her palm and continued to support from behind. She wasn't the only one supporting.</p>, <p>Xiu!</p>, <p>An arrow flew at fast speeds, hitting the tough fur of the Nyxfernal. Sparks flew, but nothing came out of it.</p>, <p> Aoife frowned and turned her head slightly.</p>, <p>\"....Aim for its eyes.\"</p>, <p>\"Got it.\"</p>, <p>He pulled the string of the bow back and prepared to attack again.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stood quietly beside him. Until this moment, I remained standing without doing a single thing. I had no business interfering.</p>, <p>I knew the extent of my skills. There wasn't much I could do. At least, not yet.</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and extended the threads towards the ground, splitting them in three. I looked around to locate the best area to set them up.</p>, <p>BOOOM—!</p>, <p>I ignored the chaos around me and guided the threads carefully around the walls of the cave.</p>, <p>My head twitched as I felt a sharp pain. However, I ignored the pain and continued to guide the threads around the walls of the cave.</p>, <p>I was waiting for the right time to act.</p>, <p>For...</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>I felt a sudden vibration and opened my eyes.</p>, <p>\"What...\"</p>, <p>There was something odd about the vibration. It wasn't coming from the Nyxfernal in the distance. It was coming from somewhere else...</p>, <p>\"Beneath...?\"</p>, <p>I looked down.</p>, <p>It was then that it happened.</p>, <p>!</p>, <p>Something exploded from beneath me and the ground split. The area it covered was small, and it was right beneath where I stood.</p>, <p>The footing I held disappeared, and my body jolted with a weird sensation as gravity started to pull me down from beneath.</p>, <p>In that split second, I felt the world around me slow down.</p>, <p>I managed to catch a glimpse of everything around me. From the changing expressions of Leon, Evelyn, Aoife, Luxon... to the look of panic on Wesley's face as he fell alongside me.</p>, <p>.....I caught all of it in my mind before everything turned dark.</p>, <p>The last thing I remembered was recalling the threads and creating new ones.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Julien...\"</p>, <p>It all happened so fast that nobody was able to react on time.</p>, <p>BOOOM!</p>, <p>All Leon felt was a subtle trembling of the ground behind. When he turned his head, he caught a glimpse of Julien.</p>, <p>....As usual, he seemed unperturbed. Even as the ground beneath him quaked, he stood with a frown. As if this had nothing to do with him.</p>, <p>Or maybe things had happened too fast for him to react.</p>, <p>Even so...</p>, <p>His figure, alongside Wesley's disappeared from their sight.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>He could hardly make a sound before his ear detected an odd whistling noise heading right in his direction.</p>, <p>Instinctively, he moved back and just barely managed to avoid the tail of the Nyxfernal.</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>\"Get a grip.\"</p>, <p>A cold voice echoed beside him. When he looked, he saw Aoife staring at the monster with a tight frown.</p>, <p>\"I know you're his knight, but you need to focus on the monster in front of us. We can look for them later. They should be f—uh!\"</p>, <p>Her words halted and she raised both her hands.</p>, <p>Leon looked at the creature which stopped mid-motion before nodding his head. She was right.</p>, <p>There was no point in thinking about Julien. He was going to be fine.</p>, <p>There was no way his instincts would lie to him.</p>, <p>He...</p>, <p>Was definitely fine.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>I opened my eyes. Darkness embraced my vision as my head throbbed. I hung suspended in the air as the threads kept me in place.</p>, <p>\"Where am I....?\"</p>, <p>I looked up.</p>, <p>There was hardly any light.</p>, <p>It seemed like I had fallen into a deep hole.</p>, <p>I closed my eyes and felt the threads. There were a total of two left. The other one had snapped. I focused on creating another one and safely planted it into a crack on the wall.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>I tried pulling myself up, but that seemed to be impossible given my current abilities.</p>, <p>The threads were still fragile. It was already a miracle that I was safe.</p>, <p>\"....Looks like I have no choice but to go down.\"</p>, <p>It was the only thing I could do.</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>In the darkness, I slowly and carefully extended the threads, guiding my body toward the bottom of the hole.</p>, <p>I thought back on the situation and frowned.</p>, <p>There was someone who had fallen with me. What had happened to him? Had he died...? Or was he still alive? I pursed my lips and continued to guide myself down until I eventually felt my feet touch a surface.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>The air felt damp and a still silence filled my surroundings. A strange tension lingered over my surroundings as I felt my muscles tense and my skin grow cold.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I took a quiet breath and took out my bag where I reached for my torch.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>A pair of eyes immediately greeted my sight the moment I lit up the torch and my heart almost stopped. Thankfully, I was able to keep myself composed.</p>, <p>....I was somewhat used to fear.</p>, <p>\"Took you long enough.\"</p>, <p>A familiar voice reached my ears, and when I got a better look, I stood frozen by the sight that bore before me. The only thing I could recognize were his hazel eyes. Everything else was different.</p>, <p>The contours of the face were distorted, with areas of puckered flesh. The color was uneven, ranging from red to mottled shades of brown and gray.</p>, <p>What had...</p>, <p>Happened to him?</p>, <p>\"You're alive.\"</p>, <p>That was all I managed to utter in the end.</p>, <p>He smiled then.</p>, <p>\"What's with your expression, phecda? Are you mad at how I told you to stick close to me? I had to do it. You didn't pick up any of my messages. We're supposed to start soon.\"</p>, <p>\".....?\"</p>, <p>Phecda? Message? Start soon?</p>, <p>I felt my blood grow cold and my fingers twitched.</p>, <p>'No, this...'</p>, <p>All of a sudden, an idea sprouted in my mind.</p>, <p>\"This isn't the first time you've seen my face. But right, yeah...\"</p>, <p>His expression twisted slightly.</p>, <p>\"I guess you were disgusted by the way I looked. You made that pretty clear back then when you beat me up.\"</p>, <p>A lot of things started to click in my mind all of a sudden. The reason for his fear, and his antagonism towards me.</p>, <p>'Ah, this...'</p>, <p>\"Why aren't you speaking....? You were rather vocal back at the camp when you killed your way to the top. I'm supposed to be following your orders, but you went and outdid yourself didn't you?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>His eerie smile stuck right close to me. His hazel eyes turned, and I felt the back of my neck tingle as my heart started to beat faster.</p>, <p>Slowly my head lowered, and my eyes fell on his forearm.</p>, <p>His clothes were ripped so I could see it well. However, much to my shock, I saw nothing. As if noticing my actions, he frowned and followed my line of sight.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing? Uh? Why are you...\"</p>, <p>He stopped and looked at me.</p>, <p>His expression changed all of a sudden.</p>, <p>But it was too late.</p>, <p>In that split second, my threads were already at his throat. Before he could even react, I clenched my hand as a fountain of red sprayed on me.</p>, <p>Pfttt—</p>, <p>The scent of iron lingered in the air as I felt my face grow wet.</p>, <p>\"Ukh.\"</p>, <p>I took several steps back.</p>, <p>My stomach churned and I hastily closed my eyes.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>....I had to do it.</p>, <p>I repeated such thoughts in my mind. It hardly worked as my stomach continued to churn, but it didn't stop me from repeating it.</p>, <p>'I had to do it.'</p>, <p>It was either me or him...</p>, <p>That much I knew.</p>, <p>My thoughts were further confirmed the moment I opened my eyes again and my gaze once again fell on his forearm. The once clean forearm suddenly changed as a black clover appeared.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I knew then that my guesses had been right and I turned to stare at the tattoo on my arm.</p>, <p>\"What is the meaning of this...?\"</p>, <p>New pieces of information entered my mind.</p>, <p>Pechda? Camp? What sort of situation was this...?</p>, <p>I thought about keeping the conversation going to get more information, but I realized it was a stupid idea. I knew nothing about the organization. A simple slip-up and he would've noticed that I wasn't Julien.</p>, <p>What would happen to me then?</p>, <p>I didn't care to find out and acted swiftly. His guard was down, and his attention was away from his surroundings.</p>, <p>All it took was a simple moment.</p>, <p>....While I didn't expect him to be helpless against my attack, I was still ready for any counter he might've made. His death seemed surprising.</p>, <p>Perhaps, he really didn't think I would kill him.</p>, <p>'Is there some sort of harsh rule that forces members to not kill each other? Is that why his guard was so down?'</p>, <p>If not for that, I didn't think I would've been able to kill him so easily.</p>, <p>Still, his death only brought more questions. There was also the fact that I had to deal with the aftermath of this.</p>, <p>Thankfully, I was the only one aware of Etherwave. I could place the blame for his death on the monsters here. Perhaps even hide the traces of the threads...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>My mind continued to spin in the silence as I forced myself to look at the headless body in front of me.</p>, <p>I took a deep breath and looked at my forearm.</p>, <p>Or more specifically, toward the second leaf.</p>, <p>It was once again shining.</p>, <p>'He may not be alive, but there was a way for me to find more information...'</p>, <p>I pursed my lips and quietly looked up. I didn't want to do it. I hated the sensation that came with understanding another's emotions. But... I had to do it.</p>, <p>To get some clues... I had to do it.</p>, <p>\"I have to.\"</p>, <p>I lowered my hand and placed it over his body.</p>, <p>That's when I pressed the leaf and my world darkened.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Sorry for bad upload rate.

Even he felt that it would be difficult for all of them to handle these many of them at once. So for him to be able to do it all by himself...</p>, <p>\"How?\"</p>, <p>He found that hard to believe.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>Such was the reality of the situation as Julien calmly stood up from his spot to brush his clothes which were covered in blood.</p>, <p>A strange silence gripped the surroundings as all eyes fell on him.</p>, <p>That was until...</p>, <p>\"Ah...!\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's shout brought everyone back.</p>, <p>\"What? What's going on?\"</p>, <p>The first to react was Luxon who looked at her with a frown. She was looking toward the distance with wide-open eyes as she pointed toward a certain area.</p>, <p>\"T-that...\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>From there, everyone could see what she was pointing at, and their expressions shifted once more.</p>, <p>\"Wesely...?\"</p>, <p>A headless corpse. One that wore a distinctive uniform that could only belong to those who belonged to the Haven Institute.</p>, <p>Almost immediately, all eyes fell on the figure that stood in the middle.</p>, <p>He seemed completely nonchalant about the situation. His eyes weren't even on the corpse or them.</p>, <p>It was his behavior that made all of them grow wary as a sudden thought crossed their minds.</p>, <p>What if...?</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>Leon was the first to call him out. Of everyone present, he was the only one who didn't jump to conclusions.</p>, <p>\"....What happened?\"</p>, <p>Finally, Julien's head turned and their gazes met. As if he understood what he was talking about, he slowly answered.</p>, <p>\"He died.\"</p>, <p>\".....I can see that.\"</p>, <p>Leon slowly blinked.</p>, <p> \"How did he die? Did you...?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Shaking his head, Julien pointed toward a certain direction. Following his line of sight, Leon's eyes jumped up.</p>, <p>It was there that he managed to catch a glimpse of a severed head. One that was badly burned.</p>, <p>\"I wasn't the one who killed him. I'm not capable of doing that.\"</p>, <p>\"No, that makes no sense.\"</p>, <p>Aoife cut the conversation short as she moved towards the severed head. She closely examined it before turning to look at Julien with a frown.</p>, <p>\"These scars... They're obviously healed.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Julien calmly stared at her for a short moment before turning to look at the severed head. For the briefest of moments, Leon saw Julien's face contort. However, he was quick to hide it.</p>, <p>\"Possibly. I didn't have the time to check...\"</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>Aoife glanced at the surroundings briefly before nodding. She didn't seem too convinced but accepted the explanation. Especially when considering how differently the monsters had been slain compared to the corpse.</p>, <p>He could've perhaps done that on purpose, but there was no denying the burned-up face before them.</p>, <p>Julien...</p>, <p>He wasn't capable of doing such a thing.</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, Aoife looked at Leon who looked back at her.</p>, <p>\"For now, let's head back. We'll report this to the institute. They'll do the investigating.\"</p>, <p>\"Okay.\"</p>, <p>Leon readily agreed and turned his attention away from Julien.</p>, <p>The same was true for the others who looked anywhere but his direction.</p>, <p>.....There was something about his current demeanor that threw them all off.

Almost detached.</p>, <p>But within them, they could feel a certain rage that they didn't want to address.</p>, <p>They felt...</p>, <p>Maddening.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Please come with us.

Make yourself comfortable in the meantime.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I sat down and closed my eyes.</p>, <p>The lingering traces of the anger I had perceived from the vision began to fade, and I started to feel normal again.</p>, <p>I was confident in my chances of making it out without any problems. I didn't use curse magic when dealing with Wesley. Had I used it... There would've been a strong chance his death would've been linked to me.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>There wasn't. I made sure that to be the case.</p>, <p>It was likely that the Academy would attribute his death to one of the monsters.</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>But that wasn't the only thing they'd be worried about.</p>, <p>The fact that his true face had been revealed probably was what the Academy was investigating.</p>, <p>....They probably didn't care about his death as much as his real identity.</p>, <p>I couldn't blame them. After all, he had managed to sneak in right under their noses. It made me think deeply about the organization I was dealing with and their strength.</p>, <p>Surely, an organization that could sneak in 'spies' in such a prestigious institute had to be extremely powerful. Several times more than the Institute itself.</p>, <p>'The Inverted Sky.'</p>, <p>Was what they called themselves. At least, from what I had managed to glimpse from the memories.</p>, <p>They appeared to be a group of fanatics who kidnapped young children to brainwash them.</p>, <p>Even now...</p>, <p>Thinking about what I had seen, my stomach churned in disgust.</p>, <p>'Evil bastards...'</p>, <p>The memories of the vision remained glued to my mind. Constantly reminded of what I had seen, and just what atrocities they had committed.</p>, <p>There were a lot of things that I had managed to learn from the vision. However, what bothered me the most was the fact that I... No, Julien was part of this very organization.</p>, <p>And he wasn't simply a small member.</p>, <p>'Phecda'</p>, <p>Such was the name I was referred to back in the cave.</p>, <p>What did it mean, and what did it signify...?</p>, <p>I wasn't exactly sure, but... I knew that it meant a rather important position.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I sat in silence staring at the empty desk before me as I felt my back tense.</p>, <p>'They're probably going to come for me soon.'</p>, <p>Wesley and I were supposed to carry a mission.</p>, <p>The fact that he had died and I was present was rather suspicious. However, I knew the moment that I was part of this organization that there was no point in trying too hard to make it seem as though it was an accident and that I wasn't involved.</p>, <p>They weren't stupid.</p>, <p>I was sure they knew I was in some way involved in his death.</p>, <p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>, <p>I drummed my fingers over the wooden desk.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'It's not exactly a bad position.'</p>, <p>This situation...</p>, <p>I could make use of it.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Within this area where the institute's discipline was upheld, several school board members tasked with administering disciplinary measures for the cadets were present.</p>, <p>The accused sat on the other side of the \"invisible glass,\" awaiting his judgment.</p>, <p>He sat quietly behind a desk with a calm face.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus. The Black Star.\"</p>, <p>The accused name and title were read out to the members of the room.</p>, <p>\"How deeply is he involved in this matter?\"</p>, <p>The disciplinary elder, a rough man with a thick frame and bald head stood at the center of the formation.</p>, <p>Besides him, a young man who appeared to still be a cadet held up a piece of paper as he spoke.</p>, <p>\"The results have come back negative. The likelihood of him being the culprit is unlikely. There are no traces of curse magic, and given how cleanly the head had been severed, it is also unlikely to be done by a magician.

The elder felt his breath leave his body the moment their gazes met, as an intense pressure bore down on him.</p>, <p>Thankfully, as a high wizard, he was able to remain composed.</p>, <p>Forcing those feelings down, he managed to ask.</p>, <p>\"What do you think about the situation....?\"</p>, <p>A strange silence filled the room shortly after he asked that question.</p>, <p>With her gaze lingering over him for the briefest of moments, she turned her attention back to Julien who seemed to have felt their gazes as he lifted his head.</p>, <p>Then, with a slight tug of her lips, she leaned her cheek on her propped-up fist.</p>, <p>\".....I wonder.\"</p>]\n",

You're free to go.\"</p>, <p>Just like that...?</p>, <p>I stayed rooted in my seat for a few moments, attempting to comprehend the situation. I gazed intently at her expression, which resembled that of a blank piece of paper, before gradually rising from my seat.</p>, <p>\".....Okay.\"</p>, <p>There were a lot of things that I wanted to ask, but decided otherwise.</p>, <p>I knew she had some answers to some of the questions I had, but I chose to remain silent. It was still too risky.

Despite the organization being known to only a select few important figures within the empire, she was certain that if anyone discovered the tattoo on his arm, he would have hell for it.</p>, <p>The fact that he never intended to hide it was what aroused Delilah's curiosity the most.</p>, <p>She felt like there were a lot of possibilities for such a situation. Perhaps there was an internal conflict between the groups within the Inverted Sky.</p>, <p>....Or perhaps he was a traitor.</p>, <p>Maybe it was just a random tattoo he got and he had no part in all of this at all.</p>, <p>Delilah wasn't exactly sure the exact reason, but...</p>, <p>\"....I'll know soon.\"</p>, <p>Of that she was sure.</p>, <p>Regardless of what he did, his actions were sure to bring those from the Inverted Sky over to the Institute.</p>, <p>All would become clear then.

I had a certain destination in mind. Taking the train from the Academy to Lens, I took a change and headed for 'Rosea'.</p>, <p>Located two hours from Lens, Rosea was a much smaller town located near a sizable mountain range.</p>, <p>The air was fresh and greenery covered the surroundings.</p>, <p>I retraced my memories and walked along a small path. It was a place I had never been before, but I knew exactly where I was and the path I was following.</p>, <p>Soon enough, the remains of a large mansion appeared within my sight.</p>, <p>\".....I'm here.\"</p>, <p>I could still picture the mansion in my mind.</p>, <p>It stood tall and grand, capturing the attention of all that passed.</p>, <p>....Such was how it was before the vision.</p>, <p>Right before the flames came.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>The silence that gripped the surroundings felt stifling, but I paid no attention to it.</p>, <p>I just felt like I had to be here.</p>, <p>It brought me a strange peace of mind. Especially towards the anger and rage that was gripping my chest.</p>, <p>Even now...</p>, <p>I was still under the effects of the vision.</p>, <p>The anger that had been transmitted to me refused to leave.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>I stepped around the mansion and looked around. The entire structure lay in ruins with charred spots all over the place. Vegetation had already started to reclaim the remnants of what was once a grand and imposing mansion.</p>, <p>Eventually, my steps halted.</p>, <p>I stood before a headstone.</p>, <p>[In loving memory of William Kenneth]</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I gripped my chest.</p>, <p>The anger that resided in my chest threatened to boil all over all of a sudden. A voice echoed within the depths of my mind.</p>, <p>'Which one was she trying to save...?'</p>, <p>'Me.'</p>, <p>'....Or her?'</p>, <p>'Who?'</p>, <p>The voice continued to whisper within my mind as I had the sudden urge to break the headstone apart in front of me.</p>, <p>Unknowingly, my jaw clenched tightly and so did my fists.</p>, <p>'Who?'</p>, <p>Even I was starting to question this.</p>, <p>But it all stopped by a sudden voice.</p>, <p>\"Who... are you?\"</p>, <p>I turned my head to see a young girl with long black hair standing not so far from where I was. Her appearance seemed vaguely familiar.</p>, <p>\"....What are you doing in front of my brother's tomb?\"</p>, <p>Brother...</p>, <p>I closed my eyes for a brief moment.</p>, <p>'Right, it's her.'</p>, <p>Eleonora Kenneth.</p>, <p>William Kenneth's sister and the little girl in the vision.</p>, <p>I lowered my hat to hide my face.</p>, <p>\"I was just passing by when I saw this place. It seems like an unfortunate event has happened here.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes. It's been over a decade since.\"</p>, <p>She walked up to the tombstone and sat down.

Her eyes were red, and her hands were trembling.

About a five-minute walk. The surroundings were quiet, and I basked in the silence that surrounded me.</p>, <p>It felt oddly peaceful.</p>, <p>That was until...</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I passed a certain figure and I found my steps pausing.</p>, <p>I turned around and our eyes met. Long platinum hair, red eyes, and a face that one wouldn't forget even if they tried.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>Kiera Mylne.</p>, <p>She looked at me with her usual scowl.</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>Then, with a click of her tongue, she tapped the cigarette in her hand against the ground.</p>, <p>Tzzzz—</p>, <p>\"Happy now?\"</p>, <p>\".....I didn't say anything.\"</p>, <p>I was starting to learn to not let such things bother me. While the smell that lingered in the air still made me feel nauseous, I was starting to learn to take it.</p>, <p>I had no right to force someone to do something against their will.</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>But Kiera didn't seem to think the same way as me.</p>, <p>\"Your fucking expression says it all.\"</p>, <p>\"Does it...?\"</p>, <p>And here I thought I had kept my expression firm.</p>, <p>\"...Tsk.\"</p>, <p>She clicked her tongue again and flicked the cigarette away.</p>, <p>\"Whatever, I don't feel like smoking anymore. You've ruined the mood for that.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I didn't say anything to that.</p>, <p>All I did was pause for a second and suddenly she lost all interest in smoking.</p>, <p>That was on her not me.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right.\"</p>, <p>Kiera paused all of a sudden as she recalled something. Rummaging through the pocket of her skirt, she took out something and tossed it to me.</p>, <p>\"Here. I think this is yours.\"</p>, <p> I caught it with one hand and looked at it.</p>, <p>\"What is this?\"</p>, <p>It appeared to be a torn shoulder pad.</p>, <p>Was this...</p>, <p>\"It's yours.\"</p>, <p>It sounded like she was quite certain of it.</p>, <p>\"I saw you when you were coming back from the expedition. You were missing a shoulder pad. I found it in an area where a lot of monsters were killed. Gruesome shit.\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I remained quiet and took my gaze away from the shoulder pad and back to her.</p>, <p>\"You know what's crazy?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>\"The injuries of the monsters I found coincide with that guy's death. You know, that Weasel guy?\"</p>, <p>Weasel guy?</p>, <p>\"Wesley.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, right. Yeah, that guy.\"</p>, <p>She traced her thumb across her neck.</p>, <p>\"Clean as shit. Never seen anything quite like it. Well, I did. The wound looked eerily similar to the ones from the monsters I found the shoulder pad in\"</p>, <p>I knew then what she was trying to imply and I felt my muscles grow tense. Though I didn't show it outwardly, Kiera still smiled. It was as if she could read my inner thoughts.</p>, <p>I thought she was going to push things further from there, but surprisingly, she didn't.</p>, <p>\"Whatever though. None of my business.\"</p>, <p>Yawning, she stretched her body.</p>, <p>\"None of my fucking business. Was just saying.\"</p>, <p>Then, as if the conversation had never happened, she left.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I stood in silence for a brief moment before staring at the shoulder pad in my hand. I thought this before, but she really was a...</p>, <p>\"Crazy bitch.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>Darkness engulfed the room as the door closed. Kiera blinked twice before reaching for the switch and turning the light on.</p>, <p>The dark.</p>, <p>She didn't like the dark.</p>, <p>The moment the light came on she felt her chest lighten.</p>, <p>\".....Ah.\"</p>, <p>She looked at her room. It was extremely clean. Contrary to her messy appearance, Kiera liked to keep things organized. If even the slightest thing was disorganized, she'd lose focus over everything and would think about it all day.</p>, <p>It was something she was born with.</p>, <p>\"Uh...\"</p>, <p>She had just taken a step into her room when she noticed something.</p>, <p>Fiddling with her pockets, she smacked her head.</p>, <p>\"Fuck.\"</p>, <p>Without hesitation, she rushed towards one of the drawers in the room and opened it.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>But there was nothing inside.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>The same was true for the drawers beneath.</p>, <p>Clank—</p>, <p>They were completely empty.</p>, <p>\"Fuuuuck.\"</p>, <p>She...</p>, <p>Had run out of cigarettes.</p>, <p>And it was too late for her to get any because it wasn't the weekend yet.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Kiera slumped down on her bed and blankly stared at the ceiling. She was fucked. Royally fucked. Cigarettes were like medicine to her... They were what kept her panic attacks from occurring.</p>, <p>Without them, she was...</p>, <p>\"Fuck, it's all that bastard's fault.\"</p>, <p>No, it wasn't.</p>, <p>But she wanted to blame someone. At the very least, it would make her feel better.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus. He was like a piece of wood. His expression was hard to read. She had been sure about her accusations. That it was not an accident. He was the one who had killed Weasel.</p>, <p>On the outside, he appeared to be a victim just like him, but Kiera was confident of her conjecture.</p>, <p>\"But who am I to care...?\"</p>, <p>It was none of her business to begin with.</p>, <p>All nobles were like that. Rotten on the inside.</p>, <p>She wasn't one to rat out people like that. Especially since the evidence she gathered wasn't going to hold up well.</p>, <p>It was just...</p>, <p>Interesting.</p>, <p>\"....He's stronger than he lets out.\"</p>, <p>Right, he was the Black Star. The number was on within the first years, but it was a general consensus within the first years that he was the weakest.</p>, <p>His results proved that to be the case and a reason why there was doubt about his involvement in Weasel's death.</p>, <p>Kiera thought so too.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>As she recalled the images she'd witnessed back in the mirror dimension, she found herself smirking.</p>, <p>\"What a load of bullshit.\"</p>, <p>The guy was a snake.</p>, <p>There was more to what he let on than people thought. For what reason was he hiding his strength, she wasn't sure.</p>, <p>Nor did she particularly care.</p>, <p>So long as he didn't involve her in his bullshit she was going to not care.</p>, <p>Still, it was an interesting thought.</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>Mumbling his name, Kiera closed her eyes.</p>, <p>\"....You owe me one.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The next day.</p>, <p>While Leon was waiting for the Professor to come.</p>, <p>\"How many funghi did we manage to collect?\"</p>, <p>\"About seven.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn and Aoife were busy discussing the splits of their finds.</p>, <p>\"Seven...? That would mean that there's one in excess.\"</p>, <p>\"Hmmm. We would've been even if he...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn paused there, but the meaning behind her words was clear. Had Wesley still been alive, then all shares would've been equal.</p>, <p>The only problem was that he wasn't.</p>, <p>Aoife, while staring at the mushrooms displayed on the table, suddenly turned her head and asked,</p>, <p>\"What do you think?\"</p>, <p>\"I don't know. I'll think about it later.\"</p>, <p>Class was about to start soon.</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>Aoife frowned before nodding her head. Then, recalling something, she quietly asked,</p>, <p>\"There's work experience next week. Have you selected which place you want to go to?\"</p>, <p>\"....I'm a knight.\"</p>, <p>Leon answered flatly.</p>, <p>Of all the people present, he was the only one who didn't need to attend the mandatory work experience that everyone had to attend.</p>, <p>Why?</p>, <p>Because he was already working.</p>, <p>\"Ah, right.\"</p>, <p>Aoife turned her head to briefly stare at the front where a lonesome figure sat.</p>, <p>As always, he was by himself. He was staring at the front with no particular expression.</p>, <p>\"Is it tough to be his knight?\"</p>, <p>The question attracted the attention of those around.</p>, <p>They all seemed somewhat curious.</p>, <p>Leon thought about the answer. Had it been before, he would've answered yes without a doubt, but the current Julien...</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Right, the current Julien was different.</p>, <p>However, the two of them still needed to keep their act.</p>, <p>\"Doesn't surprise me.\"</p>, <p>Aoife deliberately sighed.</p>, <p>\"Oh, looks like the class is full~\"</p>, <p>A middle-aged lady entered the classroom all of a sudden. She was tall, and despite her aging features, she still was quite beautiful.</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette. In charge of today's class, [Understanding of Spells], the students favored her due to her bubbly personality.</p>, <p>Arriving by the podium at the front, she set her files down and cleared her throat.</p>, <p>\"Before we start the lecture, I have an announcement that I want to make. Please pay attention.\"</p>, <p>Her words seemed to have had an effect as the class quieted down. She smiled as a result and continued.</p>, <p>\"As you may know, in a month the Guild Lantern Festival will begin.\"</p>, <p>Leon's eyes narrowed upon hearing the name of the event.</p>, <p>His body slightly tensed as his gaze wandered to Aoife who was staring at the front with a straight face.</p>, <p>'Looks like there isn't much time left.'</p>, <p>Something big was going to happen on that day.</p>, <p>And it was something that directly involved Aoife. He was sure of it.</p>, <p>\"A lot of important figures will be coming, and we must set a good impression on them.\"</p>, <p>The Guild Lantern Festival was an academy-wide event that was hosted by the academy each year and invited all the top officials from the fifteen major guilds.</p>, <p>They weren't the only people that were set to come as celebrities and important figures were also set to attend.</p>, <p>It was a 'must attend' event that couldn't be missed.</p>, <p>\"Outside of the combat analysis that will take place, I've discussed it with the other departments and we've got several events that you can take part in for extra credits.\"</p>, <p>The classroom immediately became rowdy at that. In order to pass the first year, one had to accumulate a total of 110 credits.</p>, <p>Each class held different weights. For example, this class held about 8 credits. And they could only be accumulated through passing the examinations.</p>, <p>It was tough to collect credits.</p>, <p>It was also for this reason that the eyes of the many people in the class lit up at the mention of possible credits.</p>, <p>Even Leon felt his back straighten.</p>, <p>\"The events are as follows.\"</p>, <p>Unfurling a piece of paper, Professor Bridgette began to read.</p>, <p>\"Food preparation. Your job will be to host a stand and sell food that you produced.\"</p>, <p>Leon shook his head.</p>, <p>Wasn't very interested.</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>He turned his head to see Aoife sweating. She seemed to be glaring in a particular direction. Following her line of sight, he was surprised to see her looking at Julien.</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>Why...?</p>, <p>\"Next up is play. The Language department is looking for suitable people to carry out a play in English.\"</p>, <p>He didn't pay further attention as the professor continued to list the events.</p>, <p>That too didn't sound very interesting.</p>, <p>Leon felt that his English was decent at best.</p>, <p>\"Next up is Parade. You can help out the seniors who are planning on....\"</p>, <p>\"Cultural exchange. Create or bring some products of your hometown to share with...\"</p>, <p>\"Children's activities. There will be a lot of younger...\"</p>, <p>The list went on and the more Leon listened the more he shook his head.</p>, <p>Parade? Didn't care.</p>, <p>Cultural Exchange? The Evenus Barony hardly had any cultural products.</p>, <p>Children Activities? He already had a hard time dealing with Julien.</p>, <p>There wasn't anything that was suitable for him.</p>, <p>He frowned.</p>, <p>'Should I just choose something easy...?'</p>, <p>At this rate, it would be his only option.</p>, <p>Or so he thought.</p>, <p>\"Talent activity. Display your talent at the theater. From special talent, to even a stand-up routine....\"</p>, <p>From the corner of his eyes, Leon caught a glimpse of Julien's figure.</p>, <p>He had been rather calm the entire time while listening to the events. However, the moment the 'stand-up routine' was mentioned, his body twitched.</p>, <p>It was as if he was planning something.</p>, <p>\"....It can't be.\"</p>, <p>Leon unconsciously muttered those words out loud.</p>, <p>\"Leon?\"</p>, <p>Enough to warrant the attention of Evelyn who was close to him.</p>, <p>But he didn't care.</p>, <p>No, he couldn't care.</p>, <p>\"It's an event that's hosted by the comedy club, but they didn't specify who can participate. So long as you want to participate, you can sign up and...\"</p>, <p>Julien's head raised again.</p>, <p>\"Oh, no...\"</p>, <p>Leon felt his body grow cold and the hair at the back of his neck stood.</p>, <p>\"If anybody is in—\"</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>\"Leon!?\"</p>, <p>Leon found himself standing abruptly.</p>, <p>He could feel the gazes of everyone in the classroom directed his way. But he didn't care. He stared straight at the professor who tilted her head at him.</p>, <p>\"The comedian part...\"</p>, <p>Leon slowly started to say as his gaze lowered to meet Julien's.</p>, <p>Julien wore an expression that seemed to say, 'You? A comedian? What joke is this...?'</p>, <p>Leon felt even more reassured about his decision as he firmly gripped the side of the desk and muttered through his clenched teeth.</p>, <p>\"...I'll do it.\"</p>, <p>For the sake of everyone present.</p>, <p>\"The stand-up. I'll do it.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>'Has this guy lost it...?'</p>, <p>Such were the thoughts of everyone in the classroom as they stared at Leon who had abruptly stood up at the opportunity of becoming the stand-up for the talent show.</p>, <p>I shared similar thoughts with the others.</p>, <p>'This guy is biting more than he can chew.'</p>, <p>What comedian?</p>, <p>He hardly even changed his expression. Furthermore, he always seemed to be against my jokes.</p>, <p>With someone who had no sense of humor, how could he even be a comedian?</p>, <p>\"Are there any objections?\"</p>, <p>The class was quiet from that point. Nobody seemed to have any objections.

It was cramping for some reason.</p>, <p>\"Kh.\"</p>, <p>\"That's great.\"</p>, <p>The Professor seemed even more excited. Clap--! Clap--! She clapped twice to gather the attention of everyone in the class.</p>, <p>\"If everyone would quiet down for a second. I'd like us to hear a sample.\"</p>, <p>The classroom fell silent then. With all eyes on Leon, he stood rigidly on his spot.</p>, <p>I too looked at him.</p>, <p>I was curious. He seemed to always trash my jokes.

Especially Professor Bridgette who seemed taken aback.</p>, <p>Leon on the other hand tried his best to keep his expression straight.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>In the silence that ensued after he said his joke, I found myself frowning intensely. I felt a sudden sense of crisis.</p>, <p>This guy...</p>, <p>\"...He stole my joke.\"</p>, <p>What bullshit.</p>, <p>It was one of my favorites too.</p>, <p>\"Ah, this...\"</p>, <p>Following the awkward silence that plunged the classroom, Professor Bridgette forced a smile.</p>, <p>\"Well, it was a great attempt.\"</p>, <p>Her words also seemed rather forced.</p>, <p>\"Ehm, so... I'll talk to the comedy club. We'll.. ah, see how things will go from there. I'll let you know then, okay?\"</p>, <p>\"...Yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon quietly nodded his head before sitting down.

For now, Professor Bridgette left the festival selection list by the podium saying something along the lines of, 'We'll figure this out later... I'll talk with the other departments. You can come fill it up whenever you want. Even after class.'</p>, <p>Nobody brought up the situation since.</p>, <p>The class began.</p>, <p>\"Spells.

I didn't need to turn to know who it was.</p>, <p>\"Aoife.\"</p>, <p>Who else would it be but her?</p>, <p>With stellar grades in almost everything, she would've been the Black Star if not for me and Leon.</p>, <p>\"As we know, there are five stages to a spell. Beginner, intermediate, advanced, superior, and perfected.\"</p>, <p>\"Yes, and what else?\"</p>, <p>\"The difference among spell categories lies in the number of runes each possesses. Beginner spells comprise twelve runes, while intermediate spells include eighteen. Advanced spells entail twenty-four runes. Superior spells contain thirty runes, and finally, perfected spells consist of precisely forty runes.\"</p>, <p>I paid close attention to the words that were being said. Although I knew it, it was still important.</p>, <p>\"Correct.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette clapped enthusiastically.</p>, <p>\"As expected of you Aoife. Well done.\"</p>, <p>Just then, when I turned around, faintly, I saw the corner of Aoife's lips pull up. She tried to hide it, but it was obvious that she was happy with the praise.</p>, <p>It was kind of cute.</p>, <p>\"Now then...\"</p>, <p>The lecture continued.</p>, <p>\"Since everyone already knows the basics, I'll ask a different question.\"</p>, <p>Professor Bridgette looked around the classroom.</p>, <p>\"Who here can tell me the requirements for learning an intermediate spell and up?\"</p>, <p>A hand raised up again.</p>, <p>It was Aoife again.</p>, <p>\"....Aoife.\"</p>, <p>\"The requirement corresponds to your tier.\"</p>, <p>She went on to give a detailed explanation.</p>, <p>\"An Apprentice is restricted to learning beginner-type spells due to their low mana capacity. A Master Mage can advance to learning Intermediate ranked spells. High wizards are eligible for advanced-ranked spells. Arch-Wizards have access to superior ranked spells, while only a Monarch can harness a Perfected ranked spell.\"</p>, <p>I frowned all of a sudden.</p>, <p>There was something about her explanation that didn't quite make sense to me.</p>, <p>Her next words served to prove that.</p>, <p>\"It's crucial not to waste too much time learning too many spells. After all, mastering even one spell requires a significant investment of time, and as you progress, the number of spells you'll need to learn only increases.\"</p>, <p>What sort of...</p>, <p>I felt my brows furrow further.</p>, <p>A lot of the information that was being said I knew. However, it wasn't as though I knew everything.</p>, <p>I had been learning a lot of stuff, but not everything.</p>, <p>That was why I suddenly raised my hand. There was something that was bugging me.</p>, <p>\"Julien? Do you have a question?\"</p>, <p>\".....I do.\"</p>, <p>Sorting out my thoughts, I suddenly asked.</p>, <p>\"Can spells be upgraded?\"</p>, <p>The thing was...</p>, <p>I actually was already capable of using an intermediate-ranked spell.</p>, <p>[Sadness]</p>, <p>At tier 1, I was still an apprentice-ranked mage. To become a Master Mage I needed to reach Tier 3.</p>, <p>Was it just because the Emotive Field was different? But then...</p>, <p>Hands of Malady — Lvl. 1 [18%]</p>, <p>Chains of Alakantria — Lvl. 1 [0%]</p>, <p>Why...?</p>, <p>Why was there a Lvl. 1 written beside the two spells? No, all my spells...?</p>, <p>Could it be...</p>, <p>\"Upgrade a spell?\"</p>, <p>My thoughts were broken by the Professor who tilted her head and looked at me strangely. She wasn't the only one who looked at me like that. Half of the class was.</p>, <p>Some were frowning, while others were looking at me weirdly.</p>, <p>I knew the answer then.</p>, <p>But the Professor continued.</p>, <p>\"....It's not possible. You can't upgrade a spell from beginner to intermediate. As you know, spells have different sets of runes. All runes are connected and form a perfect balance. Adding more would simply destroy the spell.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I unknowingly let out a strange sound.</p>, <p>It suddenly struck me then.</p>, <p>My spells...</p>, <p>\"I see, thank you.\"</p>, <p>I could upgrade them.</p>, <p>'This...\"</p>, <p>I felt my heart race at the thought and all noise from my surroundings drowned out.</p>, <p>'I didn't pay much attention to it because of everything else that I was learning, but my spells..... they can be upgraded. And I'm the only one that can do it...'</p>, <p>What did that mean? Why me?</p>, <p>And what would happen if the spells upgraded?</p>, <p>Would they change to a fundamental level, or would they remain the same but stronger?</p>, <p>The sadness spell went from only working when touching to working with just my voice.</p>, <p>What would happen if it were upgraded further?</p>, <p>\"Huh.\"</p>, <p>The thought suddenly made my breath feel heavier.</p>, <p>I quietly called up the status window to look, and another thought suddenly crossed me.</p>, <p>Would it be possible for me to learn intermediate-ranked spells as an Apprentice? If so...</p>, <p>I silently gulped.</p>, <p>Clap—! Clap—! It was the sudden sound of hands being clapped that broke me out of my thoughts and I looked up. Professor Bridgette was smiling, looking at the clock on the right side of the classroom.</p>, <p>\"We've got thirty minutes left to class. I think that's enough for me today. I'll give you the remaining thirty minutes to practice your spells for yourself. I'll be observing from here, and if you have any questions feel free to ask me.\"</p>, <p>She went on to sort out several documents at the podium. I stared at her figure for a few seconds before lowering my head.</p>, <p>There was still a spell I hadn't unlocked.</p>, <p>[Chains of Alakantra]</p>, <p>I had been at it for the past month and failed each time. I could practice [Hands of Malady] to push it to intermediate, but after thinking about it, I discarded the thought.</p>, <p>That process was going to take time.</p>, <p>On the other hand,I was almost able to unlock my last spell.</p>, <p>I could feel it.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Taking a look at the time and Professor, I decided to immerse myself in my spell.</p>, <p>It was time I finally learned this spell.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It's unfortunate that I have to go premium. This is a message for those who are considering buying priv.</p>, <p>Please don't. At least, not until the end of the month. There's only 5 days left in the month, and I wouldn't want you to waste your money.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The thirty minutes we had at our disposal flew by faster than I had anticipated.</p>, <p>Tzzzz—!</p>, <p>Immersed in my practice, I barely heard the Professor's words.</p>, <p>\"Would you look at that? The class has ended. You may leave if you wish to. If there are any questions you can ask me. I'll be here for a few more minutes.\"</p>, <p>She went on to press her hand against the podium.</p>, <p>\"If you haven't by now, please put your name on the list. I'll leave it here for today. I'll be here to collect it tomorrow morning.\"</p>, <p>The class became rowdy then, and it was only once I heard the noise that I fully realized it was the end of the class.</p>, <p>\"Hua… I'm so tired~\"</p>, <p>\"Tell me about it. Good thing I don't have anything after this. I think I'll go eat something at the canteen.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh, I'll join you.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, right. Before we leave let's sign up for the event.\"</p>, <p>\"Alright.\"</p>, <p>I frowned and looked up.</p>, <p>The conversations were disrupting my concentration. I sighed then and leaned back on the chair.</p>, <p>I thought back on what I managed to accomplish in class.</p>, <p>And…</p>, <p>'…..Not much progress.'</p>, <p>I was still stuck at eleven runes.</p>, <p>I hardly accomplished anything in the thirty minutes that were given to me.</p>, <p>The last rune simply just refused to connect.</p>, <p>Unlike last time though, I was able to learn to manage my frustration. The more well-learned I was about an emotion, the more I could control it.</p>, <p>For this reason, I wasn't disheartened. Having already experienced the intense frustration that came with failure, it took a lot more than this to get me frustrated.</p>, <p>\"Hmmm.\"</p>, <p>I looked at my timetable.</p>, <p>There was no other class that I needed to attend.</p>, <p>\"Should I….?\"</p>, <p>I looked around me. The noise in the classroom was starting to quiet down. The place was big, and I felt more refreshed staying here.</p>, <p>Since I didn't feel like going back, I decided to stay behind and practice more.</p>, <p>As the class started to empty, I felt the gazes of the other cadets on me as they left, probably wondering why I was still there.</p>, <p>It felt a little disturbing, so I waited for all of them to leave before resuming my practice.</p>, <p>Only then did I feel at peace and once again started to practice.</p>, <p>Rune One—Rune Two—Rune Three…</p>, <p>This time...</p>, <p>\"....I'm going to succeed.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p> In life, there were highs and lows that one experienced.</p>, <p>It was something that came with age. The older one got, the higher the chances of them experiencing a low.</p>, <p>Leon today experienced a low.</p>, <p>\"What the hell was that…?\"</p>, <p>Feeling Evelyn's gaze, he found himself turning his head away from her. She was the only one who even bothered to stay back to talk to him. Everyone else just left.</p>, <p>\"Did you seriously think that was funny?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Leon pursed his lips.</p>, <p>How could he tell her that he had no jokes prepared and panicked? The only reason he had volunteered in the first place was to stop Julien from joining.</p>, <p>He hadn't expected Julien to retaliate like that.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Leon frowned and found himself clenching his fists.</p>, <p>If only he had been ready...</p>, <p>He wouldn't have used Julien's joke had he been ready.</p>, <p>Though…</p>, <p>\"Heh.\"</p>, <p>He felt his stomach cramp a little recalling the face Julien made when he stood up to volunteer.</p>, <p>The look of hurt and betrayal on his face…</p>, <p>\"Hehe.\"</p>, <p>It made him chuckle unknowingly. All until he felt a certain gaze. It bore through his face and stung quite a lot.</p>, <p>\"You…\"</p>, <p>As expected. A horrified Evelyn met his gaze. Her face was pale, and she took several steps back.</p>, <p>\"Don't tell…\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Leon cut her off and tried to explain himself.</p>, <p>'I was laughing at the face Julien made.'</p>, <p>But stopped himself from speaking.</p>, <p>How exactly could he say that...?</p>, <p>Misunderstanding his inner struggle, Evelyn took another step back as realization dawned on her.</p>, <p>\"So you really did laugh at Julien's joke back then.\"</p>, <p>\"Uh...?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's face scrunched up. She seemed to want to say something but stopped and sighed.</p>, <p>\"Promise me something, Leon. Just… don't sign up for the stand-up. I don't know why you want to do it, but you're just not fit for it.\"</p>, <p>Before he even had the chance to say anything, Evelyn left.</p>, <p>The only thing he could remember as she left was the disappointment in her face as she looked at him.</p>, <p>It...</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>At that moment, Leon raised his head to stare at the tall ceiling.</p>, <p>There was only one thought that ran through his mind then.</p>, <p>\"…..I saved them.\"</p>, <p>Yeah.</p>, <p>He was a hero.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Late into the evening.</p>, <p>It was already dark outside and the training grounds were empty.</p>, <p>Mostly.</p>, <p>Clank!</p>, <p>A large metallic noise resounded throughout the expansive grounds as a large black box dropped on the ground with a loud sound.</p>, <p>The surroundings shook slightly as it bounced on the hard ground.</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip.</p>, <p>The sound was accompanied by the patter of sweat dropping and the sound of heavy breaths.</p>, <p>\"Haaa… Haa...\"</p>, <p>Aoife stared at the box in front of her with a pale face.</p>, <p>\"Fifty kilograms…\"</p>, <p>That was her current limit. It was the heaviest her telekinesis powers could go up to.</p>, <p>However, it was meaningless.</p>, <p>While it was indeed the heaviest she could go, her control was not there.</p>, <p>35kg was her comfort weight. The weight where she could freely control the box. It wasn't much, but as a borderline Master Mage, this was her limit.</p>, <p>Any more and she would lose all control. That would mean she'd only be able to lift the item, but not move it.</p>, <p>Drip! Drip…!</p>, <p>Sweat continued to drip down her face as she brushed her hair away from her face. It was sticky from all the sweat.</p>, <p>\".....I think it's time.\"</p>, <p>Aoife checked the time. It was 10 P.M, almost curfew time.</p>, <p>'Right, I need to fill in the form.'</p>, <p>The one for the festival.</p>, <p>Her original plan was to do it after dinner, but she had been so immersed in her training that she forgot.</p>, <p>\"Hopefully, the list is still there.\"</p>, <p>It should be.</p>, <p>She was just about to clean up when her pocket vibrated. Frowning, she reached into it and took out a small orb.</p>, <p>Her brows immediately jumped up and she hastily tapped onto the orb.</p>, <p>An illusionary face appeared. A handsome man with short red hair and distinctive yellow eyes appeared.</p>, <p>\"Brother?\"</p>, <p>He was none other than her brother, Gael K. Megrail.</p>, <p>Immediately, Aoife cleared her throat and fixed her hair. It was something she did unconsciously.</p>, <p>\"Is there a reason for why you've called me?\"</p>, <p>—Is there a reason for me to call my little sister?</p>, <p>An all-familiar smile greeted her. Aoife attempted to smile back but found herself unable to.Especially when she noticed how pale his expression was.</p>, <p>Her fists clenched.</p>, <p>\"How are you doing...?\"</p>, <p>—Haha, I'm fine. What are you so worried about?</p>, <p>He raised his right arm and flexed.</p>, <p>—My mana may be sealed, but my body isn't. Look at this!</p>, <p>All Aoife saw was a skinny arm. There was hardly any muscle.</p>, <p>She forced a smile again.</p>, <p>\"Looks good...\"</p>, <p>—Oh, come on. I can tell you're lying.</p>, <p>\"I'm not.\"</p>, <p>He cocked his head.</p>, <p>—It's obvious.</p>, <p>\"It's not. \"</p>, <p>Aoife insisted while trying to keep her face straight.</p>, <p>—Haaa... What am I going to do with you?</p>, <p>In the end, he resigned himself and sighed.</p>, <p>—Fine, you win. You weren't lying.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Aoife finally found a small smile. However, it didn't last for very long. Especially when she took note of his cheeks which had started to sunken.</p>, <p>'....Brother.'</p>, <p>She secretly bit her lips.</p>, <p>He hadn't always been like this. There had been a time when he was the center of attention. The crown prince and the next in line for the throne.</p>, <p>If only...</p>, <p>Her fists clenched tightly and an image appeared in her mind.</p>, <p>With an arrogance that was fitting of someone of her talent, she stood before her father.</p>, <p>'Seal his mana.'</p>, <p>He, the Emperor of the Empire, could do nothing but helplessly stare at her.</p>, <p>Her talent was too dazzling.</p>, <p>The stronghold her family had was starting to shatter. A new power started to emerge and they could do nothing about it.</p>, <p>'Remember. I know my worth. If you want to keep me in this Empire then you're better off meeting my demands. You can try eliminating me now, but I doubt you'll be able to. When the time comes, I'll join another Empire.'</p>, <p>Even now she could recall her arrogant voice as it echoed throughout the halls of the royal palace.</p>, <p>'I'm not being unreasonable. I just want to see how committed you are in wanting to keep me. Suppress his mana just as you did to the commoners. Do it for five years and you'll have my loyalty.'</p>, <p>A figure stepped up.</p>, <p>'I'll do it, father. Please let me do it.'</p>, <p>Aoife clenched her fists.</p>, <p>She had only been fifteen then. Three years had passed since, and every day those memories haunted her.</p>, <p>She remembered everything. From the helpless expression of her father to the resigned look of her brother who, despite being more talented than her, had no choice but to stop practicing mana for the next five years.</p>, <p>Five years didn't sound like much, however, for someone like her brother who had a large mana pool, sealing his mana was equivalent to crippling him.</p>, <p>His body which was accustomed to the high mana started to fail him, resulting in his current condition.</p>, <p>—Cough...! Cough!</p>, <p>\"Brother!\"</p>, <p>Aoife's face changed.</p>, <p>—Cough... I'm fine. Don't worry. It's just... the usual.</p>, <p>However, seeing how adamant her brother was, she could only bite her lips and watch as he held a tissue next to his mouth.</p>, <p>—Anyways... cough... I just wanted to see how you were doing at the institute. Seeing your current state, you must've been training. I guess I won't take any more of your time.</p>, <p>\"Ah, no it's fine.\"</p>, <p>—Just do your thing. Call me whenever you need something.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>—Oh, and...</p>, <p>He paused to look at her. Aoife met his gaze back.</p>, <p>—....Don't resent your father for the decision. It's something I agreed to do as well.</p>, <p>Aoife frowned.</p>, <p>—Just focus on yourself and don't think about revenge. She... isn't someone you are capable of catching up to.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Aoife clenched her teeth tightly. She was just about to rebuke him when his face disappeared.</p>, <p>—Remember my words. Make sure you eat well and don't resent father too much! The last thing Aoife saw was his smiling face.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Silence plunged her surroundings as she stood in the training grounds without saying a word.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>In the end, all she could do was out a long sigh.</p>, <p>\"....As if I can forgive him.\"</p>, <p>her father...</p>, <p>He was just as guilty as she was.</p>, <p>That much was clear to her.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>Cleaning up after herself, Aoife headed straight for the Dorset Hall.</p>, <p>There were several activities that she had in mind for the festival, but in the end, she settled for the 'Guide' position.</p>, <p>Her job was rather simple.</p>, <p>All she had to do was guide people around the Academy campuses.</p>, <p>It was an important position. One that many coveted. With many important figures attending, the 'Guide' was the role that enabled cadets to interact with them.</p>, <p>Of course, Aoife didn't need such a position given her background.</p>, <p>However, it was also because of her background that she felt compelled to do this job. She was, after all, acquainted with most of the attending people.</p>, <p>It wouldn't hurt to choose it.</p>, <p>\"It should be this classroom.\"</p>, <p>Her feet stopped in front of a familiar door. The corridors were empty, and it was pretty dark.</p>, <p>Reaching for the door, she opened it and prepared to enter when she stopped.</p>, <p>\"Mh?\"</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip...!</p>, <p>A certain dripping sound caught her attention and when she looked inside to see where it was coming from, her eyes shot open.</p>, <p>\"Almost...\"</p>, <p>Off by the far end of the classroom, a familiar figure sat. His back was straight, and his facial features could only be described as 'flawless'.</p>, <p>He was a man Aoife struggled to understand, as he rarely displayed any expressions.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>\"....Again.\"</p>, <p>Here he was, sitting in the middle of the classroom, wearing a different expression than his usually stoic one.</p>, <p>His focus was on his hand where a set of runes were floating in the air. They were slowly interconnecting with each other to form a circle.</p>, <p>'Is he trying to unlock a spell...?'</p>, <p>That was what it seemed.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Why is he bleeding?\"</p>, <p>Unlocking a spell wasn't that difficult. At the very least, it wouldn't need someone to force themselves to the point of bleeding.</p>, <p>As she counted the number of runes, she was also sure that it wasn't an intermediate-ranked spell.</p>, <p>'He's struggling with unlocking a beginner rank spell...?'</p>, <p>Was that even possible?</p>, <p>Tzzzzz--!</p>, <p>Aoife frowned after witnessing the circle shatter.</p>, <p>Drip...!</p>, <p>More blood dripped down from his nose.</p>, <p>'Is this the limit to his talent?'</p>, <p>It wasn't as though she didn't expect this, but it was somewhat disappointing given the many surprises he had given her.</p>, <p> She thought he was going to stop there, but...</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>He continued.</p>, <p>\"Uh?....Is he crazy?\"</p>, <p>Aoife felt her eyes widen. Staring at his arms which were trembling, his pale face, and bleeding nose, Aoife forgot all about her goal and stood rooted behind the door.</p>, <p>She started to grow curious all of a sudden.</p>, <p>For how long was he going to keep this up?</p>, <p>\"Again...\"</p>, <p>Another circle shattered.</p>, <p>Drip...! Drip...!</p>, <p>More blood dripped down from his nose.</p>, <p>His usually stoic expression was replaced by one of pure focus and determination.</p>, <p>It was as if he was a completely different person than how he normally showed himself.</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>Regardless of how many times he failed, he'd wipe his nose and continue.</p>, <p>It was as if he didn't care at all about himself.</p>, <p>Even as his entire body trembled, and his eyes turned bloodshot, he continued. The only thing he could mutter seemed to be, 'again'.</p>, <p>\"....Crazy. Lunatic.\"</p>, <p>It was all Aoife could think about when staring at him. She couldn't understand why he was putting himself through such trouble.</p>, <p>And yet...</p>, <p>Even though she thought all of that, she found herself unable to tear her gaze off of him.</p>, <p>There was something about his current appearance that struck her deeply.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Time continued to pass.</p>, <p>\"Again.</p>, <p>Failure became the norm, and blood continued to drip down his nose. Even so, Aoife continued to watch in silence as he tried each time.</p>, <p>Even as he failed, he continued to try.</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>Nothing changed.</p>, <p>He still failed.</p>, <p>And just as she thought he was going to fail again, something happened.</p>, <p>\".....!\"</p>, <p>Bang--</p>, <p>Julien abruptly stood up.</p>, <p>He stared at his hand where a magic circle formed.</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>An expression she had never seen him make before.</p>, <p>A smile she had never thought was possible.</p>, <p>\"Hahaha.\"</p>, <p>And laugh that she never thought he was capable of making.</p>, <p>Aoife stood dumbfounded in her spot.</p>, <p>Taking in his expression, she unknowingly found herself mumbling something under her breath.</p>, <p>\"....So he can make a face like that too?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"I... did it....\"</p>, <p>I stared at the completed circle resting on my hand.</p>, <p>I couldn't believe it...</p>, <p>....I had actually done it.</p>, <p>\"Hahaha.\"</p>, <p>I laughed. I didn't know why I laughed, but I just did.</p>, <p>Drip...!</p>, <p>Feeling my nose run again, I wiped the blood away and finally started to pack up. I looked around and saw that it was completely dark outside.</p>, <p>How long...?</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>I checked my watch and realized it was almost past curfew. I hastily packed up my stuff and dashed to the dorms.</p>, <p>Even as I returned back to the dorm, I was still shaken by the sudden development. I hadn't expected myself to succeed. I had grown so used to failure that when success did come, all I felt was bafflement.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I looked at my hand and a purple magic circle was slowly starting to form.</p>, <p>The mana inside of my body started to drain at a rapid pace but I didn't mind it as something was starting to form in my hand.</p>, <p>Clank. Clank. Clank.</p>, <p>A peculiar metallic rattle resounded as purple chains began to materialize within the grasp of my hand.</p>, <p>Clank!</p>, <p>The process took no longer than several seconds and by the time all was said and done, I found myself holding a long chain.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I stared at the chains with a frown.</p>, <p>\"How does this work?\"</p>, <p>I closed my eyes for a moment and followed the link that connected my mind to the chain. In the darkness of my vision, all I saw was a long purple line. It was bent in a '∩' shape.</p>, <p>\"Hmm.\"</p>, <p>Finding the connection, my brows twitched and my hand shook slightly.</p>, <p>Clank...! Clank...!</p>, <p>The chains started to move.</p>, <p>At my will, they followed everything my mind told them to do.</p>, <p>They could both lengthen and shorten at my command. However, the mana consumption for such a move was rather high. Frowning, I settled for just the right length. About the size of my arm.</p>, <p>I opened my eyes and stared at my arm where the chains were coiling.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I clenched my hand into a fist. The chains glowed a strange purple hue. I knew from the description of the spell that it had a similar effect to [Hands of Malady] in the sense that it weakened an opponent upon contact.</p>, <p>However, unlike [Hands of Malady] it wasn't a long-range skill.</p>, <p>\"Not that it matters.\"</p>, <p>I slowly clenched my fist and stared at the chains coiling my arm. I started to think about all the possibilities that came with the skill when I suddenly felt lightheaded.</p>, <p>\"....Ah, right.\"</p>, <p>The chain shattered and I sat down on my bed.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>The mana expansion was no joke.</p>, <p>Just a few minutes and I was already low on mana.</p>, <p>\"I guess I'll put it off for now.\"</p>, <p>My mind was not in the right state of mind to figure the skill out. I planned on leaving it for tomorrow.</p>, <p>There was something else that I needed to pay particular attention to at the moment.</p>, <p>I reached out to grab a paper from the desk and stared at it.</p>, <p>\"Work Experience.\"</p>, <p>Who would've thought I'd be looking for a job again?</p>, <p>Work Experience. It was a mandatory event that we needed to take part in according to the Professors. It was an event that was supposed to last for a week, and depending on our performance, credits would be awarded to us.</p>, <p>\".....Looks like I have to do it.\"</p>, <p>I needed as many credits as possible.</p>, <p>My knowledge was rather 'primitive' compared to the other cadets. Coupled with the amount of time I spent each day training, I hardly had enough time to study.</p>, <p>I tried my best, but...</p>, <p>\"It's not enough.\"</p>, <p>I was desperate for credits.</p>, <p>\".....What should I choose?\"</p>, <p>The list wasn't very long. About a single page with over thirty listings. I was just about to go through the list when the world around me froze.</p>, <p>'Uh?'</p>, <p>I lost my voice and a familiar feeling gripped me.</p>, <p>'A vision....? All of a sudden?'</p>, <p>No, when did they ever have a good time? They always came randomly and when I least expected them to. I sighed and embraced the incoming vision.</p>, <p>\"It was a disaster.\"</p>, <p>An unfamiliar voice echoed, and my surroundings started to change. It was dark, and the air felt damp.</p>, <p>'A room...?'</p>, <p>No, it felt more like a cell. A prison cell.</p>, <p>Why would...</p>, <p>\"How many have managed to escape?\"</p>, <p>\"Five in total. Two Extreme-risk, one High-risk, and two low-</p>, <p>risk.\"</p>, <p>Escaped? Five...? Extreme risk, high risk, low risk? The information, while scattered, did make sense in some way.</p>, <p>My surroundings started to become clearer as I found myself inside an empty prison cell. It was just as I expected it.</p>, <p>This was a prison.</p>, <p>Two people stood by the cell looking around. Wearing similar uniforms, they were probably rather high-up in the prison system.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... This is a fucking mess. Central has been calling non-</p>, <p>stop demanding some answers. The same is true for Haven.\"</p>, <p>Haven...?</p>, <p>Why would Haven...</p>, <p>\"Ten cadets died in the escape. They're demanding answers. I don't blame them. They were here for work experience, and nothing should've happened considering our reputation, but...\"</p>, <p>The individual sighed again.</p>, <p>\"....What an embarrassment. Not only were we able to keep our prisoners in check, but we also got students involved in this mess.\"</p>, <p>Students?</p>, <p>'Oh god.'</p>, <p>Realization dawned on me and I felt my tighten.</p>, <p>A quest was coming, wasn't it?</p>, <p>\"Not only did we fail at our jobs, but we also got children involved in our incompetence.\"</p>, <p>He was clearly distressed by the situation, but it wasn't what I wanted to hear at the moment. I wanted to hear more. More information about the situation.</p>, <p>I had a few leads at the moment.</p>, <p>The event was set to happen in a week. During the work exchange. It was in a prison, and five inmates escaped.</p>, <p>I knew the danger level of the inmates but didn't know their identity.</p>, <p>This...</p>, <p>It wasn't enough.</p>, <p>I strained my ears to listen more.</p>, <p>\"Oh, right.\"</p>, <p>With a sudden halt of his steps, one of the guards suddenly looked up. He seemed to have something to say.</p>, <p>I strained to listen even more carefully.</p>, <p>\"One of the prisoners that escaped...\"</p>, <p>My heart dropped when I noticed a change in my surroundings.</p>, <p>No, not yet!</p>, <p>The surroundings began to darken, and the guard's voice started to fade. In that moment, I knew the vision was about to end.</p>, <p>But I hadn't heard enough.</p>, <p>Not yet!</p>, <p>I used every little bit of willpower to strain my ears to listen.</p>, <p>Just a little more...</p>, <p>A little...</p>, <p>\"....Wasn't he a Professor from Haven?\"</p>, <p>The vision ended there and I found myself back in my room.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haa...\"</p>, <p>My breath was heavy, and my head felt light. However, thinking back upon the vision, I found the corner of my lips gently pulled up.</p>, <p>\"...I heard it.\"</p>, <p>The last few words.</p>, <p>I had managed to hear them.</p>, <p>My vision flickered moments after and a notification appeared.</p>, <p>[ ◆ Side Quest Activated : Prison Escape.]</p>, <p>: Character Progression + 21%</p>, <p>: Game Progression + 3%</p>, <p>Failure</p>, <p>: Calamity 2 + 7%</p>]\n"
