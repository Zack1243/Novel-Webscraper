            "[<p>'Uh... I'm still alive?'</p>, <p>There was no way. But... I was starting to doubt it. That was despite feeling certain that I had drawn my last breath.</p>, <p>It was the only logical conclusion I could make as I found myself standing on the remains of a city.</p>, <p>My sinuses clogged up as a result of the smoke that lingered in the air, and I heard a low, steady ringing in my head at the same time. Sort of like the buzz of a mosquito, but a lot more annoying than that.</p>, <p>With all of that taken into account, I was certain that there was something wrong with the situation. I felt there, yet not at the same time.</p>, <p>If that made any sense?</p>, <p>Must be some sort of hallucination one experiences before death.</p>, <p>It had to be.</p>, <p>I was more convinced of this when I found myself standing amidst the ruins of a city unknown to me, confused by the peculiar architecture of the buildings. They appeared to belong to a distinct era, unlike anything familiar to my own.</p>, <p>How weird.</p>, <p>The entire situation was weird and I had trouble wrapping my head around it.</p>, <p>Despite my eagerness in wanting to find out more about what was happening to me and what the city around me was, I couldn't.</p>, <p>I was stuck where I was.</p>, <p>Or more like, I was trapped.</p>, <p>I could see, smell, hear, taste, and touch just fine. It was just that, I had no control over my body. I felt as though I were a marionette, manipulated by an external force.</p>, <p>Rumble! Rumble!</p>, <p>My focus was captured by a distant rumble, prompting my head to turn toward the source of the sound. A voice unknown to me emerged, flowing from my lips.</p>, <p>\"It's about time... I thought they'd be slower.\"</p>, <p>There was something about the voice. It sounded unnatural. Almost robotic in my ears, but I couldn't quite tell.</p>, <p>Just what is happening?</p>, <p>I was flustered, but what else could I do? There was no way out for me, and all I could do was just observe.</p>, <p>BOOOM—!</p>, <p>A distant building disintegrated, and from within its ruins emerged a particular figure.</p>, <p>Our eyes met, and I instantly sensed an overwhelming weight pressing down on my body, stifling me.</p>, <p>\"I... finally found you!\"</p>, <p>A screeching voice reverberated through the air and the sky turned a scarlet color.</p>, <p>The pressure that bore down on me increased, and she soon appeared before my very eyes.</p>, <p>She was... breathtaking.</p>, <p>More so than anyone I'd ever seen in my life, making me further question the validity of what I was seeing.</p>, <p>Adorned with flowing, fiery red locks cascading down her back, her hair danced in the sunlight, displaying hues of crimson, copper, and gold, as if flames had been artfully woven into the fibers of her hair.</p>, <p>But it was her eyes that truly caught my attention. Gleaming like golden orbs, they possess a depth and brilliance that seemed to reflect the distant sun.</p>, <p>'Just what is happening?...and why is she looking at me like that?'</p>, <p>She seemed eerily familiar, yet at the same time wasn't. I more or less knew that I had seen her before, but I couldn't quite picture when.</p>, <p>\"Is that all you have to say to me?\"</p>, <p>Her gaze contained a little something. I couldn't quite understand what it was... perhaps longing? Disappointment? I wasn't too sure.</p>, <p> \"H—\"</p>, <p>My mouth had just parted open when all of a sudden, the sky which had previously dyed red, turned a purplish hue, and lightning began to crackle down from the sky.</p>, <p>Cracka! Cracka!</p>, <p>It tore at everything beneath, destroying the buildings and infrastructures with an unstoppable might.</p>, <p>In a matter of moments, the clouds ruptured, unveiling the silhouette of a woman. Her vibrant purple hair swayed gracefully through the expanse of the sky, while her piercing gaze, brimming with an overwhelming sense of animosity, fixated upon me.</p>, <p>Cracka! Cracka!</p>, <p>The sky continued to be ravaged by relentless lightning, intensifying the pressure that oppressed every inch of my being. The force was so formidable that my legs nearly buckled beneath me.</p>, <p>Yet, inexplicably, the individual I was presently \"possessing\" displayed unwavering stubbornness. My bones cracked, and I was having a hard time breathing under the extreme pressure.</p>, <p>Yet.</p>, <p>As if what I was experiencing meant nothing.</p>, <p>I remained standing where I was.</p>, <p>\"So... you're finally here too.\"</p>, <p>His voice carried through the air, reaching the woman with lustrous, purple hair suspended in mid-air.</p>, <p>The lightning surrounding her crackled with increased intensity, while her gaze seethed with amplified hatred. However, she remained immobile, as if she couldn't move at all.</p>, <p>That was when I felt my lips curl, and the world underwent another change.</p>, <p>From Red to Purple... to Black.</p>, <p>Abruptly, darkness engulfed my sight, causing the distant city to vanish entirely. The sky dissipated, and everything in my surroundings vanished, leaving only the two women ahead of me.</p>, <p>Emerging from the depths of the inky abyss, a figure took shape in the distance. Her eyes, a vivid shade of crimson, radiated with an intense luminosity that pierced through the darkness, unveiling a cascade of snowy white hair flowing down her shoulders.</p>, <p>She too...</p>, <p>Looked at me with nothing but hatred.</p>, <p>Ah... I get it now.</p>, <p>Her appearance was what it took to make me understand.</p>, <p>Understand why they felt so familiar to me before.</p>, <p>'They're the same girls from the game that my brother showed me before.'</p>, <p>Just before my death. There was one game my brother continued to talk about. 'Rise of the Three Calamities.'</p>, <p>I didn't know much about the game as I never got the chance to play it, but it was something my brother was enthusiastic about.</p>, <p>He wouldn't stop talking about it…</p>, <p>The pieces of the puzzle fell into place as soon as all three appeared before me, triggering a recollection of the game's cover. Although I had only glimpsed it briefly without giving it much thought, it took me a moment to jog my memory.</p>, <p>But now, I was certain.</p>, <p>The three women who stood in front of me... glaring at me with such hatred that made my heart palpitate, were the same Three Calamities that belonged to the game my brother showed me just before my death.</p>, <p>Or what I thought was my death. Was I still dead? I wasn't too sure anymore.</p>, <p>They were most likely the older version of the girls on the background of the cover.</p>, <p>Contrary to their youthful portrayal on the cover, the women before me appeared considerably older.</p>, <p>Their gazes deviated greatly from the playful depiction on the cover, radiating an unrelenting aura of bloodlust that seemed to want to eat me alive.</p>, <p>\"How long has it been since we've last been together?\"</p>, <p>My mouth parted. This time, I could hear the voice more clearly. It sounded oddly calm despite the situation he was in.</p>, <p>None of the girls spoke. They just stared at me with the same expressions on their faces.</p>, <p>My lips curled further.</p>, <p>\"I like those expressions.\"</p>, <p>My hand reached forward all of a sudden and a black chalice materialized, seemingly out of thin air, landing securely in my grasp. Enclosed within its confines, a peculiar black liquid resided.</p>, <p>Rumble—! Rumble—!</p>, <p>The appearance of the chalice seemed to have triggered something as the world suddenly started to quake fiercely.</p>, <p>The girls' expressions changed dramatically and the pressure that bore on me intensified.</p>, <p>Yet, despite it all. 'I' remained where I was.</p>, <p>\"S-stop!\"</p>, <p>\"Fuck, stop this bastard!\"</p>, <p>Strings of curses flew my way, but the only response was a slight raise of the cup.</p>, <p>\"Nooo!\"</p>, <p>As the chalice approached my lips, a fleeting moment allowed me to steal a glance at my own visage, mirrored within the depths of the dark liquid residing inside.</p>, <p>Handsome.</p>, <p>Was all I could think of as I stared at the man reflected within the liquid of the chalice.</p>, <p>'Is this me?'</p>, <p>There was an air of confidence and allure that emanated from him that perfectly matched the disposition he displayed.</p>, <p>His intense, hazel eyes held a mesmerizing depth, shimmering under the blackness of the liquid, matching his lustrous black hair. The strong, chiseled features of his face were accentuated by a well-defined jawline and a perfectly proportioned nose.</p>, <p>Never in my life had I ever seen anyone this handsome.</p>, <p>'Ha, I really must be dead...'</p>, <p>Rumble—! Rumble—!</p>, <p>The world around me seemed to completely crumble. Before I knew it, the three girls were already upon me. Coming from all sides.</p>, <p>Their power sent shivers down my spine.</p>, <p>But despite it all. 'I' remained where I was, feeling a slight curl at the end of my lips as the chalice drew to my mouth and I took a sip.</p>, <p>'It's bitter.'</p>, <p>Pfttt—!</p>, <p>At that very moment, as the initial sip of liquid touched my lips, a searing agony tore through me.</p>, <p>I felt something drip from the side of my mouth as my head slowly lowered. It was there that I caught a glimpse of a large sword.</p>, <p>It passed right through my chest.</p>, <p>Drip...

            "[<p>Lead the way... To where?</p>, <p>The echo of my footsteps rang in my ears as I followed the man from the vision from behind.</p>, <p>He seemed younger than the vision, and was it just me, or did he look pale?</p>, <p>Still.</p>, <p>Thinking back to my actions, I had acted purely out of instinct.</p>, <p>I knew nothing about the situation. Nor who the man in front of me was. No, not quite... I had an idea. One that I refused to believe.</p>, <p>However...</p>, <p>If there was something clear to me, it was that whoever the man in front of me was, he could kill me at a moment's notice.</p>, <p>One wrong move and I was dead.</p>, <p>\"Master has asked that you manage to pass the examination. In case of failure, he is prepared to exonerate you from the family.\"</p>, <p>His cold and even tone resounded across the empty corridor as he moved ahead of me.</p>, <p>I remained silent throughout the entire time.</p>, <p>\"It's important that you pass the examination. I can't stress that enough. For my sake as well.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Examination?</p>, <p>What examination?</p>, <p>I strained my ears and listened attentively. Every piece of information was vital for me.</p>, <p>\"That said, I don't believe a situation like that will happen. You're more than capable of passing the examination. At the very least, you shouldn't be worse than the commoners who only had one year of practice.\"</p>, <p>He continued to speak along the way. As I listened to his words, my eyes couldn't help but trace toward my surroundings.</p>, <p>What sort of place is this?</p>, <p>The corridor seemed vast. Large windows lit up the corridors with purple curtains draped around them. It gave off a medieval vibe.</p>, <p>But there was no way, right? How could it...</p>, <p>\"...We're here, young master.\"</p>, <p>I had no time to adjust myself to my surroundings before I found myself standing in front of a large wooden door.</p>, <p>My feet came to a halt and he pushed the door open to reveal a large hall where hundreds of people stood. They all lined up in an orderly manner, facing another door at the very end of the hall.</p>, <p>\"You are...?\"</p>, <p>A woman with short black hair and glasses approached me. She held a clipboard in her hand and scanned me up and down.</p>, <p>My heart grew tense at her appearance.</p>, <p>I thought back on her question, 'You are?' and found myself unable to answer.</p>, <p>I'd like to know that as well.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Even so, I kept my composure. We stood like that for a couple of seconds before her eyes fell on my chest where realization finally hit her.</p>, <p>\"Ah, you must be from the Evenus Barony.\"</p>, <p>She glanced at her clipboard.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus. I see you.\"</p>, <p> Julien Dacre Evenus?</p>, <p>Tapping the board, she smiled.</p>, <p>\"Please follow me. I'll lead you to the examiners.\"</p>, <p>I secretly sighed in relief before glancing back for a brief moment. My eyes met his for a moment and he nodded. I looked away and followed the lady.</p>, <p>She seemed to be leading me toward the large door in the distance. I could feel the gazes of those around me as I moved. However, I paid them no mind.</p>, <p>Not because I didn't want to, but because I couldn't spare them the thought.</p>, <p>The closer I was to the door the faster my heart started to beat.</p>, <p>The only thing I knew was that I had to take an examination. What sort of examination, I didn't know.</p>, <p>My palms felt sweaty and my legs felt like lead.</p>, <p>Each step felt heavier than the last.</p>, <p>The only reason I followed along was purely because the situation forced me to.</p>, <p>It felt like I had to move.</p>, <p>But what now?</p>, <p>What was I supposed to do now?</p>, <p>\"We're here. Please don't be too nervous. They won't bite.\"</p>, <p>The woman graciously opened the door, unveiling the expanse of a generously decorated room. Elegant paintings adorned the walls, flanking the space alongside pristine white pillars.</p>, <p>What grabbed my attention was the large wooden desk that sat in the middle of the room where four individuals sat. In front of them was a boy with blonde hair and blue eyes. He wore a strange uniform and stood upright in front of the four individuals.</p>, <p>I felt a terrifying pressure coming from the four of them, and amongst them, a woman with long flowing black hair grabbed my attention.</p>, <p>She seemed the center of the four people, not just because of her looks, but because of the aura she gave off.</p>, <p>She had something beyond her beauty... Something I couldn't quite explain.</p>, <p>Just what sort of...?</p>, <p>\"You must be Julien.\"</p>, <p>Her lips curled slightly as she glanced at the papers before her. Looking away, she pointed ahead.</p>, <p>\"You must be here for the examination. Please make your way toward the center.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I had no choice but to follow along.</p>, <p>It only became more evident to me that there was something wrong with the people in front of me when I closed in on them. I couldn't quite describe it... but just standing close to them felt extremely pressuring.</p>, <p>As if boulders were being pressed against my back.</p>, <p>Even so, I held onto my composure and kept my face firm.</p>, <p>But that only lasted a second before I felt my right forearm sting. What's going on? When I looked down, I realized that one of the four leaves from the tattoo had lit up.</p>, <p>Why was it...</p>, <p>As if bewitched, my body moved on its own and my finger hovered over it. I was surprised by the sudden development, but before I could snap out of it, my finger went down.</p>, <p>And.</p>, <p>I pressed it.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>\"...Huh?\"</p>, <p>The world turned pitch black.</p>, <p>All my senses seemed to disappear. Silence pervaded over the pitch-black space with nothing in sight. It felt as if I was levitating in an endless and lonely space.</p>, <p>It felt suffocating.</p>, <p>I was stuck in place, floating in this endless darkness that seemed to stretch endlessly. My consciousness was blurry, but I was aware of everything that was happening around me.</p>, <p>Was everything I previously saw another vision?</p>, <p>Is this what death feels like?</p>, <p>...It felt lonely.</p>, <p>And cold.</p>, <p>'Ah.'</p>, <p>The sensation didn't carry on for long. All of a sudden, a current ran through my body, jolting my consciousness awake.</p>, <p>When I came to, I realized I could finally move my body again.</p>, <p>Even so.</p>, <p>My surroundings were still dark.</p>, <p>'Hello?'</p>, <p>I tried to speak, but my mouth refused to open.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I held onto my composure and pushed away the anxiety and fear that was creeping up on my mind. I didn't let the darkness eat away at my sanity.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>'Hm?'</p>, <p>Just as I regained my composure, I spotted a bright light in the distance. A light...? It grew brighter by the second, its glow basking me in warmth.</p>, <p>It felt comfortable.</p>, <p>To the extent that I found my eyes slowly closing in relaxation.</p>, <p>'...Uh?'</p>, <p>When I opened them again, I was stunned by the sight before me and I held my breath.</p>, <p>'A wheel?'</p>, <p>Six colors, and six words.</p>, <p>Red - Anger</p>, <p>Purple - Fear</p>, <p>Blue - Sadness</p>, <p>Green - Surprise</p>, <p>Orange - Love</p>, <p>Yellow - Joy</p>, <p>A long red arrow pointed upward, currently resting on the color red.</p>, <p>Anger.</p>, <p>'What is this...?'</p>, <p>The six basic human emotions? I remember studying this back in psychology class, but why...</p>, <p>Trrrrr--!</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>The wheel began to spin on its own.</p>, <p>'...What's going on?!'</p>, <p>The colors alternated between red, purple, blue, green, orange, and yellow... They spun and spun and spun.</p>, <p>A deep sense of unease held me rooted. My eyes were fixed on the red arrow that remained firm.</p>, <p>The wheel continued to spin, and the colors continued to alternate. Gradually, the wheel lost its momentum before finally stopping.</p>, <p>'Purple.'</p>, <p>Fear.</p>, <p>Now what? My palms were sweaty, and the deep sense of unease that gripped my body seemed even more prominent.</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>And I was right to feel that way.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, the ground beneath me quaked. I almost lost my footing, and just as I regained it, I was shocked to see buildings sprouting from the ground beneath.</p>, <p>\"What...? Uh?!\"</p>, <p>I held my mouth.</p>, <p>\"I can speak again?\"</p>, <p>No, not just that... I looked around me. I was surrounded by buildings. No, not quite. They seemed to be ruins. The architecture reminded me of the one from the vision, but they were covered in vines and moss.</p>, <p>I couldn't quite get a good grasp of it since it was dark outside. However, from the corner of my eyes, I could make out faint figures in the distance.</p>, <p>Shadows?</p>, <p>Swoosh--!</p>, <p>A shiver ran through me as the cold wind caressed my skin. I grew tense, feeling a sensation that was akin to the gentle touch of two fingers slowly crawling their way up my arm.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa...\"</p>, <p>I felt my breath grow heavy, and as I tried to swallow, I found myself unable to. Something had gripped my throat. Something imaginary.</p>, <p>It prevented me from swallowing.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>My chest trembled.</p>, <p>'There's nothing in front of me...'</p>, <p>So why...?</p>, <p>Why did I feel so scared?</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I gripped my shirt, slowly wrinkling it in the process. There, I could feel the beat of my heart.</p>, <p>It was fast.</p>, <p>Ba... Thump! Ba... Thump!</p>, <p>And loud.</p>, <p>\"Ha...\"</p>, <p>My breath followed its rhythm.</p>, <p>It went faster.</p>, <p>And faster.</p>, <p>faster....</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haa.. Ha...\"</p>, <p>I was hyperventilating.</p>, <p>My palms were sweaty and sweat trickled down the side of my face.</p>, <p>Fear had gripped me.</p>, <p>It was slowly consuming me.</p>, <p>I could feel it.</p>, <p>But why?</p>, <p>'...I need to run. Get away from here.'</p>, <p>My legs started to move. All thoughts disappeared and I just ran. Faster. And faster. And faster...</p>, <p>Soon, I found myself sprinting forward. I ran as if my life depended on it. I didn't know why I was acting like this, but if there was something I knew it was that I needed to run.</p>, <p>Get as far away as possible.</p>, <p>\"Ukh..!\"</p>, <p>I stumbled several times, scraping my knees in the process, but each time, I'd pick myself back up again and continue to run. I ignored the burning sensation that came with each breath that I took.</p>, <p>The only thought I had in my mind was that I needed to run.</p>, <p>I needed to get away from the shadows.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa.... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I'd look back from time to time, catching sight of them each time. The distance between us remained constant. Are they not running out of breath as well?...I can't keep this up for long.</p>, <p>The pain that gripped my lungs intensified. It was as if I was breathing fire.</p>, <p>But I had to hold on.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>Not...</p>, <p>Bang--!</p>, <p>My face came smashing against a hard surface.</p>, <p>\"Uakh...!\"</p>, <p>Ignoring the pain, I looked up.</p>, <p>\"No, I....\"</p>, <p>A shadow appeared. Its appearance remained a mystery to me. It wobbled in front of me, staring down at me as if I were some sort of prey.</p>, <p>\"Ah... Don't...\"</p>, <p>The sense of fear that gripped me intensified.</p>, <p>It was almost suffocating.</p>, <p>\"I... I...\"</p>, <p>The words refused to leave my mouth.</p>, <p>And then.</p>, <p>\"Uekh!\"</p>, <p>The shadow reached out for my throat, gripping it tightly. My eyes bulged, and I felt my body grow limp.</p>, <p>Ah, no... I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'll die...!</p>, <p>The feeling of helplessness under its grip, the steady thump of my heart, the weakness, and the gripping fear--all of it was etched deeply into my mind during those last moments.</p>, <p>What I was experiencing...</p>, <p>It was real.</p>, <p>And then.</p>, <p>Cr Crack--!</p>, <p>I felt my neck snap and the world turned dark again.</p>, <p>Only for a brightness to suddenly engulf me.</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Examinee?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah...?\"</p>, <p>I slowly raised my head. Four figures sat not far from where I was standing. They all stared at me with frowns while a young man with blonde hair stood not far from me.</p>, <p>'Isn't this...?'</p>, <p>Slowly lowering my head, I stared at my right forearm where the tattoo was. It no longer hurt, and it wasn't glowing anymore.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>My arm was trembling.</p>, <p>The emotions I felt before... They continued to linger over me. I couldn't get rid of the sensation. It felt suffocating.</p>, <p>I needed an outlet.</p>, <p>An outlet to let everything out.</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Is everything alright? We don't have all day.\"</p>, <p>One of the people seated in front of me, a bulky man with a red beard raised his eyebrow, pointing at the young man in front of me.</p>, <p>\"...Show as what you've got.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>My feet moved on their own.</p>, <p>As if I had finally found what I needed, I moved toward the young man in front of me. He was staring back at me with a frown. As if he was trying to say, 'What is he doing?'</p>, <p>But I didn't care.</p>, <p>I paid him no mind and continued forward.</p>, <p>Before I knew it, I was standing before him. Just as his mouth opened to say something, my hands reached out for his head, grasping both sides solidly. My hands were still shaking but I kept a firm grip on his head.</p>, <p>His expression changed.</p>, <p>\"You, what are you...!\"</p>, <p>But I didn't care.</p>, <p>Feeling the sides of his face, my mouth parted open as I softly mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Fear.\"</p>, <p>My mind blanked from then on.</p>, <p>I lost myself in the moment.</p>, <p>When I came to, I was standing in the same spot I was before. My hands were no longer shaking, and my mind seemed calmer.</p>, <p>Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"H-help...! Haa.. Haa...!\"</p>, <p>When I looked down, I was stunned to see the young man from before on the ground. His face was pale, and he held his head with both hands while mumbling things like, 'Ah... I'm sorry...! Ah...'</p>, <p>As our eyes met, his expression distorted and his pupils dilated.</p>, <p>\"Ahhh...! N-no...!\"</p>, <p>He hastily moved back.</p>, <p>What is going on...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>A small screen appeared in front of me.</p>, <p>That was when I understood.</p>, <p>Lvl 1.

            "[<p>Expectations were minimal before his entrance.</p>, <p>Behind their desk, the four examiners conversed with each other, reviewing the files of the examinees.</p>, <p>\"The overall talent level is lower than last year. It's rather disappointing if I'm being honest. At this rate, the other institutes within the empire will catch up to us.\"</p>, <p>The man with the red beard mumbled—Herman Chambers, a High-Wizard, and a man known for his discernible eye for talent. As such, he was put in a position of recruitment for the upcoming year at the Haven Institute.</p>, <p>Just by visualizing the flow of mana coming from an examinee's body, he could more or less tell if they were talented or not.</p>, <p>From the thickness, and its purity... He'd be able to discern the overall level of the examinee before they even performed.</p>, <p>\"Please bring the next examinee.\"</p>, <p>Compared to last year, the talents were severely lacking.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"We've found a couple of little monsters, haven't we?\"</p>, <p>There were a few exceptions.</p>, <p>And those few exceptions were far above the norm.</p>, <p>\"...I guess you're right.\"</p>, <p>Herman crossed his arms and leaned back on the chair. From the corner of his eyes, he glanced at the woman sitting beside him.</p>, <p>She adorned herself in formal attire, exuding a near-perfect aura. Her captivating presence left a profound impact on those around her. The flawless combination of appearance and clothing made her stand out from the rest.</p>, <p>Delilah V. Rosemberg.</p>, <p>There were no imperfections or voids in her, to the extent that she appeared to embody perfection itself.</p>, <p>Elegance seamlessly permeated her every action, word, and facial expression, defining her entire being.</p>, <p>She was an unreachable being to many.</p>, <p>Apprentice at 18.</p>, <p>Master-Mage at 19.</p>, <p>High-Wizard at 21.</p>, <p>Arch-Wizard at 24.</p>, <p>And one of the Empire's Seven Monarchs at 27.</p>, <p>Many foresaw her as the future of the Empire, destined to fill a position that had remained vacant for centuries—the most formidable mage among them all.</p>, <p>The Zenith.</p>, <p>'How can someone like her work here...?'</p>, <p>Such a question stumped many, Herman included, but whenever someone asked, all she'd return was an empty smile.</p>, <p>She wasn't a woman of many emotions, but when she did show emotions...</p>, <p>One'd feel chills.</p>, <p>\"...Our next examinee should be from a Barony.\"</p>, <p>Her crisp and clean tone rang in the room. It lacked substance and yet seemed to pressure at the same time.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus.\"</p>, <p>She mumbled a name, almost chewing on it as her eyes lingered over the document in front of her.</p>, <p>\"Talent. Elemental and... Emotive.\"</p>, <p> \"Emotive?\"</p>, <p>Herman raised his brow and picked up the document in front of him. 'Indeed, he has talent in the emotive field...' His expectations diminished.</p>, <p>It wasn't that he hated Emotive Mages, or looked down on them.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"It's tough.\"</p>, <p>Muttering with crossed arms and a dismissive shake of her head, Cathrine Riley Graham, a middle-aged woman with long flowing brown hair, expressed her thoughts.</p>, <p>\"An emotive Mage deals with the manipulation of emotion. It's not a rare talent, but...\"</p>, <p>Pursing her lips, she halted mid-sentence, allowing for another voice to complete the sentence for her.</p>, <p>\"...One might lose themselves if they immerse themselves too much into the study of emotions.\"</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>The Emotive field was a dangerous field. To study emotions... Understand them. One had to immerse themselves in them.</p>, <p>Immerse yourself too much... and you might end up losing sight of yourself.</p>, <p>\"I've seen my fair share of talented ones lose their minds trying to further their path. It's unfortunate. Really unfortunate...\"</p>, <p>\"Well, at least he's talented in the Elemental field. Curse Magic? Not a bad field.\"</p>, <p>There were no bad elements.</p>, <p>Only bad people.</p>, <p>Closely examining the paper in front of him, the door to the room opened. A young man in his late teens entered.</p>, <p>\"You must be Julien.\"</p>, <p>Delilah spoke, her crisp and clean voice ringing throughout the room.</p>, <p>His appearance grabbed the attention of all present.</p>, <p>'He's handsome, but... disappointing.\"</p>, <p>Herman's first impression of Julien was one of disappointment.</p>, <p>'His mana flow is irregular. The density is light and he doesn't seem to have control over it.'</p>, <p>Was he really a noble? As if he wasn't the only one who thought this, Catherine mumbled,</p>, <p>\"Seems like this one is a bit of a bust. Disappointing considering that he's a noble.\"</p>, <p>Herbert Newberman, sitting on Herman's right, shared similar thoughts with her.</p>, <p>\"His mana flow is all over the place. At first glance, he doesn't seem to know how to properly utilize mana. What a rough batch...\"</p>, <p>In the mind of the examiners, Julien seemed to have come in vain. His performance was going to be one that they'd need to erase from their minds.</p>, <p>But if there was one thing to take note of, it was his demeanor.</p>, <p>The way he carried himself... His expressionless face, and calm even steps...</p>, <p>It seemed to exude boundless confidence.</p>, <p>An overconfident idiot?</p>, <p>'Well, whatever. Let's get this over with. I've seen worse.'</p>, <p>Herman nudged the young man that stood in front of them.</p>, <p>\"Jason, go test him.\"</p>, <p>He was a first-year, or more like second-year now... cadet. He wasn't exactly the most talented cadet, but to test new examinees he was good enough.</p>, <p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p>, <p>Jason began to move, but just as he had taken a step forward, his face changed.</p>, <p>So did that of all the examiners.</p>, <p>\"What is he doing?\"</p>, <p>\"...Is he checking his pulse?\"</p>, <p>\"What sort of nonsense is this?\"</p>, <p>With a blank expression and finger pressed against his forearm, Julien stared ahead. He seemed out of it.</p>, <p>His face was blank.</p>, <p>Like that of an empty sheet of paper.</p>, <p>\"What is this guy doing...?\"</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Examinee?\"</p>, <p>Herman called out for him several times until he snapped out of it.</p>, <p>\"Ah...?\"</p>, <p>\"Examinee? Is everything alright? We don't have all day.\"</p>, <p>He irritably pointed at Jason.</p>, <p>\"...Show as what you've got.\"</p>, <p>Just as Herman pointed at Jason, a sudden change occurred with Julien. His pupils dilated. His face paled, and his arms began to tremble.</p>, <p>His sudden change took everyone aback.</p>, <p>Julien's eyes trembled, darting around hastily with an air of desperation. He seemed to transform all of a sudden, a complete difference from how he previously was.</p>, <p>His shoulders shrunk and his breathing quickened.</p>, <p>\"Haa... Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Everyone could feel the rhythm of his breath.</p>, <p>It was getting faster with each breath.</p>, <p>He seemed to be the embodiment of a certain emotion.</p>, <p>What emotion...?</p>, <p>Ah.</p>, <p>It soon became clear to everyone.</p>, <p>'Fear.'</p>, <p>He had started to embody fear.</p>, <p>Herman felt a chill run down his body.</p>, <p>Not just him, but the other examiners too.</p>, <p>\"You, what are you...!\"</p>, <p>Julien walked up to Jason. Perhaps taken aback by the situation, he wasn't able to react on time. Julien's hands came pressing against his skull, squeezing almost.</p>, <p>And,</p>, <p>\"Ahhhhhh...!!!!\"</p>, <p>A scream shook the room.</p>, <p>It pierced through it and reverberated loudly in the ears of everyone present.</p>, <p>Suddenly, everyone in the room was motionless, not just Herman, Herbert, and Catherine, but Delilah too.</p>, <p>The impact of Julien's action was just that powerful.</p>, <p>With one single action, he left everyone in the room frozen.</p>, <p>\"Ah...! No! Ahhhhh...! I don't want to die, no!!!\"</p>, <p>It was intense, and one could vividly feel the fear that Jason was feeling.</p>, <p>Goosebumps.</p>, <p>Herman felt goosebumps.</p>, <p>\"Ahhh...!\"</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>Jason fell liplessly to the floor.</p>, <p>Shaking uncontrollably, he clutched his head while writhing on the floor. Saliva spilled from his mouth.</p>, <p>\"H...Help...!\"</p>, <p>Despite his cries, none of the examiners moved.</p>, <p>All eyes were fixed on the young man that stood before them.</p>, <p>What was in front of them was the embodiment of someone who threaded a path hardly anyone took.</p>, <p>Recalling, Herman mumbled out loud,</p>, <p>\"For one to understand an emotion one must experience it.\"</p>, <p>To display such fear, one must experience it. Everyone in the room was well-versed and knew this much.</p>, <p>They had traveled all over the continent and met many Emotive Mages. From there, they learned of the harshness that one who threads such a path must endure.</p>, <p>To experience fear, one must relentlessly chase after it.</p>, <p>Many failed in their paths, dying in the middle of training, or simply not being able to understand the emotion.</p>, <p>And yet,</p>, <p>\"What sort of gruesome training did he undergo to display such emotion?\"</p>, <p>Julien was able to do what many couldn't. He was far from perfection, but to be able to do this at such an age...</p>, <p>'Just how harsh has he been on himself?'</p>, <p>Herman's evaluation of Julien underwent a drastic change.</p>, <p>'Not only is he able to perfectly portray fear, but he also seems to have mastered the state of immersion.'</p>, <p>A state many Emotive Mages chased after. A state where one could separate reality and immersion.</p>, <p>Was that why he checked his pulse beforehand?</p>, <p>To check his condition before immersion?</p>, <p>'A monster.'</p>, <p>He was a total monster.</p>, <p>\"If I may ask...\"</p>, <p>Catherine was the first to truly break the silence that took hold of the room, briefly glancing at the trembling Jason on the ground before settling her gaze over to Julien.</p>, <p>\"What sort of training did you do to be able to do this? And is it only limited to fear?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Her question was met with silence as Julien stood still.</p>, <p>He then lowered his head and shook his head.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>'Was it so bad that he doesn't want to talk about it?'</p>, <p>The judges felt their expressions harden.</p>, <p>And finally, Delilah, who had been quiet the entire time, with her gaze seemingly never detaching from Juline, opened her mouth to speak,</p>, <p>\"You're dismissed. We'll let you know your results after we've evaluated all the examinees.\"</p>, <p>Julien nodded his head and calmly walked out of the room.

I'm afraid that with your current strength, you won't find a single opponent in your age group.

Then... me?\"</p>, <p>For the first time in a considerable while, Aoife's composed expression faltered. She opened her mouth, but the words refused to leave it.</p>, <p>As though something was stuck, all she could do was move her mouth.</p>, <p>That was until,</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus.\"</p>, <p>She received a name.</p>, <p>One that she deeply engraved in her mind.</p>, <p>\"He's the Black Star.\"</p>, <p>And.</p>, <p>\"The one we deem to be more fitting of the role than you.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"....Speech, huh.\"</p>, <p>I looked at the letter in front of me. It was given to me this morning by a member of the Haven Institute staff.</p>, <p>It went on to say: \"Congratulations on your admission to Haven. We're proud to announce your entry to the institute...\"</p>, <p>It was a long letter.</p>, <p>But the key important points were,</p>, <p>\"Black Star, and speech.\"</p>, <p>A week had passed since the examination had taken place. I was now a lot more knowledgeable about my situation.</p>, <p>Therefore,</p>, <p>\".....Hah.\"</p>, <p>I knew exactly what 'The Black Star' symbolized.</p>, <p>It symbolized excellence and perfection. A goal for the other cadets to follow. All of which I wasn't.</p>, <p>I extended my hand and a faint purple magic circle formed.</p>, <p>Tzz</p>, <p>It shattered within seconds of me activating it.</p>, <p>\"Still nothing...\"</p>, <p>There was magic in this world. That was a fact I was made aware of quite early on. And apparently, I was talented at curse magic.</p>, <p>Julien that was.</p>, <p>Me...?</p>, <p>\"Seems like you've still not figured out how to properly use mana.\"</p>, <p>I continued to stare at my hand and ignored the voice that reached me from the end of the room.</p>, <p>I concentrated all my attention on my hand.</p>, <p>A warm current flushed from the center of my abdomen. One that I guided until the very tips of my fingers.</p>, <p>In my mind, a vivid image took shape, and peculiar runes hung in the air, gradually arranging themselves within the purple circle that hovered above my fingertips.</p>, <p>Almost...</p>, <p>Sweat formed on my forehead.</p>, <p>It trickled down my nose.</p>, <p>Stopping at the tip.</p>, <p>The runes set themselves within the circle. A faint glow surfaced on its edges.</p>, <p>Yes... A little more...</p>, <p>I was close.</p>, <p>I could feel it.</p>, <p>I was...</p>, <p>Tzz</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>The circle shattered.</p>, <p>All the progress disappeared in an instant.</p>, <p>∎ [Hands of malady] EXP + 0.01%</p>, <p>It wasn't an unexpected outcome. It had been like this for the entire week.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"...It's frustrating.\"</p>, <p>Trying over and over and over again, with little to no progression.</p>, <p>I thought that with enough time and practice, I'd see some improvement, but in the week that I started practicing, the only result I received was failure.</p>, <p>Drip...</p>, <p>Something wet trickled down from my nose.</p>, <p>I used my sleeve to wipe it. Only for it to be stained in red.</p>, <p>That was when I realized.</p>, <p>\"Blood...\"</p>, <p>\"You're overworking yourself.\"</p>, <p>Finally, I looked up. There, standing by the entrance of the door to my room was Leon. His grey eyes were as intense as ever.</p>, <p>\"You're trying to learn curse magic, right? So that you wouldn't look suspicious when the time comes.\"</p>, <p>\"...Right.\"</p>, <p>No, not really.</p>, <p>It was part of the reason. But it was mainly because learning any other magic would prove to be too hard of a task for me.</p>, <p>The current me that was.</p>, <p>\"Here you go.</p>, <p>Leon walked up to me to hand me a piece of paper.</p>, <p>\"This is the speech I prepared for you. You won't have to worry about practicing it because it's pretty straightforward. Plus... Nobody will suspect a thing if you say it exactly as it's written.\"</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>I reached out to take it when he pulled back. I was taken aback.</p>, <p>\"...What are you doing?\"</p>, <p>\"On second thought, I'll give it to you later.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm?\"</p>, <p>He pointed at my nose.</p>, <p>\"Clean yourself up. You're in no state to think about the speech.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>I reached for the nearest tissue to clean up my nose. It was still leaking blood. As expected, I had been practicing a little too hard.</p>, <p>Leon stood quietly beside me.</p>, <p>Closely observing me.</p>, <p>That was until,</p>, <p>\"I'll take my leave. We'll meet before the speech.\"</p>, <p>He decided to leave.</p>, <p>\"Wait. The speech...!\"</p>, <p>He left before I had the chance to ask him for the paper.</p>, <p>\"...Shit.\"</p>, <p>I stuffed a tissue up my nose.</p>, <p>\"He's still wary of me.\"</p>, <p>In the week I spent with Leon, he always seemed on edge around me. I knew exactly why he was like that, and I took full advantage of it.</p>, <p>\"I don't have much time.\"</p>, <p>But I knew that I couldn't keep the facade for much longer.</p>, <p>It wouldn't take too long for him to understand that he could kill me with a thought. That was why I was so desperate for progression.</p>, <p>Only through power would I be able to keep myself alive.</p>, <p>\"...I should go.\"</p>, <p>I checked my watch.</p>, <p>It was almost time for me to give my speech. It wasn't as though I was nervous. I was far from it.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"What then...?\"</p>, <p>My goal was to find answers. And despite a week having passed, the only thing I managed to gain was even more questions.</p>, <p>This was indeed the world of 'Rise of the Three Calamities'.</p>, <p>Although I had never played the game, the situation became clear to me after experiencing the world for the past week.</p>, <p>In the week, I continuously thought about leaving this place.</p>, <p>The vision that preceded my arrival here depicted me getting killed by a long blade, with three women in pursuit.</p>, <p>Was the vision the Julien of the future, or was it me of the future...?</p>, <p>Even if it was, how long did I have before Leon killed me?</p>, <p>\"...Regardless of the outcome, it seems like every move I make leads to my death.\"</p>, <p>For such a future, wasn't the appropriate answer to just run away? Leave this place. Surely, I'd be able to live a good life if I did.</p>, <p>\"...As if.\"</p>, <p>The thought of not knowing why I was here seemed to eat at me more than my desire to live.</p>, <p>I guess, having already died once, I placed less importance on my life than the truth.</p>, <p>\"That's not all...\"</p>, <p>My eyes wandered back to my arm.</p>, <p>Turning it, a four-leaved clover entered my sight.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>One of the leaves lit up.</p>, <p>A feeling of dread welled up within the depths of my mind as my gaze remained fixed on the leaf. It was the same leaf from last time.</p>, <p>It reminded me of the time during the examination.</p>, <p>The leaf was the reason why I was able to become the Black Star.</p>, <p>I still didn't know what it did.</p>, <p>By the time I woke up the next day, it had lit up again. I hadn't touched it since. The lingering aftereffects of the situation were still affecting me. Was my mind even capable of withstanding such intense emotions again...?</p>, <p>I wasn't quite sure.</p>, <p>But if there was one thing that I knew...</p>, <p>\"Emotions.\"</p>, <p>Anger, sadness, joy, love, surprise, fear...</p>, <p>\"...I won't be consumed.\"</p>, <p>Rustle</p>, <p>I donned a black blazer and black leather gloves to hide the wounds on my hands.

Clad in a matching blazer, a sword at his hip, he casually brushed his hair.</p>, <p>\"We'll be late if we don't hurry.\"</p>, <p>\"Right.\"</p>, <p>The two of us walked on the empty streets.</p>, <p>Tak</p>, <p>The gentle click of our heels echoed in the air.</p>, <p>He walked by my side, maintaining a respectable distance. That was his duty as Julien's designated knight.</p>, <p>The city we were in was called Lens.</p>, <p>It was the nearest city to Haven and our temporary residence. Currently, being early in the morning, there weren't many people outside.</p>, <p>The cobblestone streets were empty.</p>, <p>It was just the two of us.</p>, <p>\"We're here.\"</p>, <p>We didn't walk far. Our destination was merely a few minutes away from the residence, located near the city center. Unlike the streets, this place was packed with people.</p>, <p>Leon handed me a small paper.</p>, <p>\"Here's your ticket.\"</p>, <p>\"Thanks.\"</p>, <p>One that I took.</p>, <p>Rather than a knight, secretary seemed more fitting for him.</p>, <p>\"Wow.\"</p>, <p>I stopped in my tracks to stare ahead.</p>, <p>I was still having a hard time getting used to the sight before me.</p>, <p>A means of transportation unfitting for a world like this. One that seemed to function even better than the locomotives in the modern age.</p>, <p>\"...This really is a game.\"</p>, <p>\"Hm? Did you say something?\"</p>, <p>\"Nothing.\"</p>, <p>I boarded the train, making my way toward my cabin. [A-25] Ah... Right here. It was rather spacious and had a wide window for me to look at.</p>, <p>From there, I could see the scenery outside. The lush trees, the tall mountains in the distance, and the orange glow that dyed the sky.</p>, <p>...It felt peaceful.</p>, <p>\"How is it? Is it to your satisfaction young master?\"</p>, <p>Leon's voice brought me back. I turned to glance at him.</p>, <p>\"You can drop the act when it's just us.\"</p>, <p>The whole 'young master' thing felt rather uncomfortable. I wasn't Julien. He didn't have to call me that.</p>, <p>\"I'd rather not.\"</p>, <p>\"Suit yourself.\"</p>, <p>But he seemed insistent on calling me that.</p>, <p>I wasn't going to force him.</p>, <p>There were other things that I needed to pay more attention to.</p>, <p>Like,</p>, <p>How would Julien conduct himself if he were to give a speech?</p>, <p>The speech.</p>, <p>As Leon said. I needed to act closely as the previous Julien acted. In this world, possessing someone else's body wasn't merely a fantasy.</p>, <p>Many were capable of such a feat. Some for looks, and others for longevity reasons.</p>, <p>Unless I acted like Julien, then there was a chance someone might find out.</p>, <p>I couldn't allow that to happen.</p>, <p>\"Here's the speech.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, I wasn't completely unprepared. Having discussed it with Leon, he already had a speech prepared for me.</p>, <p>\".....Ah, thanks.\"</p>, <p>I opened the paper to see the speech. A quick scan and I didn't see anything wrong with it. In fact, it was quite short.</p>, <p>Is this good enough...?</p>, <p>\"I could've prepared the speech by myself.\"</p>, <p>Things would've probably been easier for me if that was the case.</p>, <p>\"Maybe.\"</p>, <p>Maybe...?</p>, <p>\"I just didn't want to take any risks.\"</p>, <p>\"Then couldn't I have just shown you my speech while you helped me correct along the way?\"</p>, <p>\"That would've taken longer.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I chose to leave the subject there. It didn't seem like my words were getting through to him.</p>, <p>He doesn't trust me at all.</p>, <p>Noted.</p>, <p>I shifted my attention back to the speech. It wasn't long and also wasn't hard to memorize. I could learn this.</p>, <p>While I immersed myself in the speech, the train started to move.</p>, <p>The pistons roared and the train picked up speed.</p>, <p>I naturally turned my head to look at the window.</p>, <p>Unknowingly, the paper in my hand wrinkled.</p>, <p>Rustle</p>, <p>Finally.</p>, <p>I was walking into the devil's den.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Haven, Leoni Hall.</p>, <p>His presence grabbed the eyes of all in attendance.</p>, <p>An exquisite appearance that stood out from the rest. Clad in clothing that highlighted his lean and muscular physique, his appearance imprinted itself in the minds of all present.</p>, <p>He strode with measured steps, reaching the center of the podium.</p>, <p>\"The Black Star.\"</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>\"...He's here.\"</p>, <p>A fact Aoife was made aware of the moment his name was called out.</p>, <p>Her gaze traced over his body. His every action, movement, expression... she marked them in her mind, making sure to miss nothing.</p>, <p>He was the one who took the title away from her. Someone her cousin and the institute's board seemed enamored with.</p>, <p>And the one that stood above her.</p>, <p>「It's a pleasure to be standing here amongst all of you.」</p>, <p>His tone felt rather flat.</p>, <p>It lacked any highs and lows, sounding rather indifferent.</p>, <p>「It is with great honor that I find myself in this position.」</p>, <p>As if he didn't mean the words that he was saying.</p>, <p>That was what Aoife thought at first. However, all of a sudden Julien's gaze shifted.</p>, <p>「Many of you stand at the very peak of the Empire. Proud sons of heaven...」</p>, <p>It turned sharp.</p>, <p>「Everywhere you go, people will praise you. Call you the elites of the Empire.」</p>, <p>Like that of a sharpened blade.</p>, <p>「Someone that should be worshiped.」</p>, <p>Stabbing right at those present in the hall.</p>, <p>「But...」</p>, <p>He suddenly paused, and just faintly, Aoife noticed a change. His lips... They were pulled into a smile.</p>, <p>「Remember.」</p>, <p>And as his gaze swept the hall,</p>, <p>He slowly muttered,</p>, <p>「I stand above you.」</p>, <p>The entire hall fell into a state of silence.</p>, <p>Aoife's expression underwent a small change.</p>, <p>\"What is he.....\"</p>, <p>She looked around her. All the cadets wore similar expressions. One of utter shock which soon morphed into anger.</p>, <p>The previously quiet hall started to heat up.</p>, <p>\"What did he just say...?\"</p>, <p>\"Who is this arrogant bastard?\"</p>, <p>\"Did he just say that?\"</p>, <p>Aoife took in the sight around her. The disorder and chaos that was slowly taking shape. The flustered and shocked looks of the professors. The angered looks of the cadets.</p>, <p>.....And the stoic, yet arrogant look of the Black Star who stood at the center of it all.</p>, <p>\"This isn't right.\"</p>, <p>The Black Star was supposed to be a leading figure.</p>, <p>Someone the other cadets looked up to.</p>, <p>And yet,</p>, <p>Aoife tore her gaze away from the chaos happening around her and closed her eyes.</p>, <p>\"As expected...\"</p>, <p>Her fists slowly started to clench.</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus.\"</p>, <p>He wasn't fit to be the Black Star.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The weight of over a hundred eyes weighed heavily on me. My every action seemed to be closely scrutinized.</p>, <p>From the way I walked, the way I looked, and the way I spoke.</p>, <p>All of it was assessed.</p>, <p>But even so, I didn't feel nervous. I had been a salesman in my past life. Things like this weren't a problem for me.</p>, <p>I tapped on the small ball in front of me.</p>, <p>\"It's a pleasure to be standing here amongst all of you.\"</p>, <p>It appeared to be a microphone. My voice echoed throughout the hall, reaching the ears of all present.</p>, <p>The gazes were now truly on me.</p>, <p>\"Many of you stand at the very peak of the Empire. Proud sons of heaven...\"</p>, <p>I kept my tone flat.</p>, <p>\"Everywhere you go, people will praise you. Call you an elite of the Empire.\"</p>, <p>This was simply because Leon suggested me to. He was the one who came up with the speech after all.</p>, <p>\"Someone that should be worshiped.\"</p>, <p>But that wasn't the reason why I followed the speech.</p>, <p>\"But...\"</p>, <p>The main reason why I followed it was because,</p>, <p>\"Remember.\"</p>, <p>I liked it.</p>, <p>\"I stand above you.\"</p>, <p>I almost laughed after saying that line. Taking in the expressions of all those in the hall, I almost regretted not having a phone.</p>, <p>It wasn't a pretty sight.</p>, <p>Amidst the glares of disgust, hatred, and scorn directed towards me, I chose to stand my ground next to the podium, taking in everything that was directed my way.</p>, <p>Leon's reasoning behind the speech was that he believed this was what the previous Julien would've said.</p>, <p>I didn't doubt it.</p>, <p>But that wasn't the reason why I went through with it. If I wanted to, I could've said something different.</p>, <p>But I didn't.</p>, <p>\"What sort of joke is this?\"</p>, <p>All of a sudden, one of the cadets stood up from their seat and shouted,</p>, <p>\"Are you seriously supposed to be the Black Star? I refuse to believe someone like you can be our top ranker! I request a duel!\"</p>, <p>Ah, yes.</p>, <p>This was what I wanted.</p>, <p>A cliche scenario.</p>, <p>\"Me too!\"</p>, <p>\"Julien Dacre Evenus. I request a duel...!\"</p>, <p>What came after the first was the second, and then the third...</p>, <p>\"Fight me!\"</p>, <p>The entire hall became heated with several cadets standing up and challenging me on the spot.</p>, <p>While some appeared to be influenced by a few instigators, a significant number seemed genuinely eager to fight me.</p>, <p>'Yeah, this is it.'</p>, <p>It was the effect that I desired to achieve.</p>, <p>My time was limited.</p>, <p>I needed to get stronger. And for that, I needed a target on my back.</p>, <p>Pressure.</p>, <p>A comfortable environment wouldn't shape me into a stronger individual.

It weighed heavily on them, but it was necessary.</p>, <p>Growth can only be achieved through struggle.</p>, <p>And what better way to make myself struggle than this?</p>, <p>'That's right.'</p>, <p>This had to be done.</p>, <p>For the sake of my growth.</p>, <p>\"I'll do anything.\"</p>]\n",

They seemed to be glued to my hand.</p>, <p>The one grasping Leon's shoulder.</p>, <p>She softly whispered,</p>, <p>\"Maybe you haven't changed, after all.\"</p>, <p>Her tone was laced with disappointment.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Only that I had no idea what she was talking about.</p>, <p>I only pretended to understand her, and her expression pained.</p>, <p>\"When will you stop...?\"</p>, <p>She couldn't meet my gaze at all.</p>, <p>The disappointment seemed to be too much for her to handle.</p>, <p>In a situation like this, the only way I could respond was,</p>, <p>\"Stop what?\"</p>, <p>\"...Yeah, right.\"</p>, <p>She smiled weakly.</p>, <p>It was as if she expected such an answer from me.</p>, <p>\"I waited for you. I really did. Even when you changed, I waited. I thought you'd come back to how you normally were, but....\"</p>, <p>Stopping herself, she shook her head.</p>, <p>Softly, she mumbled in a voice that I could barely hear, 'It's not worth it. There's no point.'</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I thought she'd give up from that point, but yet again, her eyes fell on my hand.</p>, <p>And then toward Leon.</p>, <p>\"Why do you let him treat you like this?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Leon stood quietly. He seemed to be chewing on his words, seemingly thinking about how to respond.</p>, <p>She spoke before he could,</p>, <p>\"I know you're loyal to the family, but why let yourself be treated like this? You're better than thi—\"</p>, <p>\"It's none of that.\"</p>, <p>Leon cut her off mid-sentence.</p>, <p>Her expression froze.</p>, <p>\"He wasn't doing anything to me.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>She stepped back and made an incredulous look. She seemed even more disappointed.</p>, <p>\"...Do you take me for some sort of fool? I saw all of it.\"</p>, <p>Saw all of it?</p>, <p>I couldn't help but speak out.</p>, <p>\"What did you see?\"</p>, <p>I struggled to understand what she was trying to say.</p>, <p>\"Seriously...?\"</p>, <p>Her expression seemed scornful.</p>, <p>\"It was obvious what you were trying to do. How many times do you think I've seen the same scene in the past? You were using him as your test dummy, as usual.\"</p>, <p>Test dummy?</p>, <p>I looked at Leon who looked back at me. His expression didn't say much, but his subtle nod told me all that I needed to know.</p>, <p>Ah.</p>, <p>So that's how it is.</p>, <p>I was just about to speak, when all of a sudden, Leon spoke.</p>, <p>\".....It isn't the case this time.\"</p>, <p>Her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"You're still defending him? Even after-\"</p>, <p>\"He told me a joke.\"</p>, <p>Uh?</p>, <p>Both me and Evelyn were taken aback.</p>, <p>A joke?</p>, <p>I looked at Leon who looked back at me. What is this guy on about?</p>, <p>Though his expression seemed indifferent, his eyes seemed to say, 'Roll with it.'</p>, <p>Roll with it...?</p>, <p>\"...A joke?\"</p>, <p>I felt Evelyn's gaze on me. She was staring at me with a face of utter disappointment.</p>, <p>I didn't understand why she was looking at me like that, but I felt like I needed to play along.</p>, <p>So,</p>, <p>\"Yeah, I did.\"</p>, <p>I went along with it.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>All it brought was silence from her. One that she broke shortly after.</p>, <p>\".....Do I look that easy to you?\"</p>, <p>I felt my skin crawl all of a sudden. If before she looked at me in disappointment, she was now looking at me with scorn.</p>, <p>\"I'm seriously asking. Do you take me for a joke?\"</p>, <p>\".....No.\"</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>Her expression was overcome with distraught.</p>, <p>I don't know why, but I felt like I needed to do something.</p>, <p>So I did,</p>, <p>\"Why don't they play poker in the jungle?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn seemed to have been about to say something when her mouth closed.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I used to chance to say,</p>, <p>\"Too many cheetahs.\"</p>, <p>Regret came quickly.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>My face burned, but I kept it from changing. On the outside, it was as if I had said something trivial.</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>Evelyn didn't seem to think of it the same way. After a brief moment of silence, she managed to force a weak smile.</p>, <p>\".....I guess you truly do think of me as a joke.\"</p>, <p>Turning to look at Leon, she bowed her head. Then, without looking back she left.</p>, <p>Her back seemed rather frail when I looked at it.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>At first, they were slow.</p>, <p>Tak, tak.</p>, <p>The sound of her steps as her heels tapped against the marble floor.</p>, <p>Tak, tak, tak.</p>, <p>But they soon hurried.</p>, <p>Her head was lowered the entire time. She could see her expression through the polished floor of the campus hall.</p>, <p>\"Hah...\"</p>, <p>The burning in her chest didn't seem to ease no matter how long she walked. Her vision blurred and her lips stung.</p>, <p>\"B-bastard.\"</p>, <p>Her feet eventually came to a stop.</p>, <p>A person stood in front of her.</p>, <p>\"....Are you okay?\"</p>, <p>It was her knight, Natasha. Standing tall, her platinum hair and crystal eyes made her stand out from the rest. Nobles had a unique perk when joining the institute. They were allowed to bring a personal attendant.</p>, <p>In Evelyn's case, she was able to bring Natasha with her. It was a precaution the noble houses took considering the political importance each child held within their houses.</p>, <p>The Verlice family was one of the five Viscount families within the Empire. They naturally were able to provide her with a powerful knight as her escort.</p>, <p>\"Was it him?\"</p>, <p>And as her knight, she was naturally aware of her circumstances.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's silence told many things.</p>, <p>Natasha's grip on her sword tightened.</p>, <p>\"So it was...\"</p>, <p>Julien Dacre Evenus.</p>, <p>A name tingled the tip of her tongue.</p>, <p>His relationship with Evelyn was hard to describe. At one point, the two were close. Almost inseparable.</p>, <p>But things changed after a certain point.</p>, <p>His personality changed, and his lust for power started to display. He changed, and his spiral started to affect Evelyn who could do nothing but watch.</p>, <p>It eventually ended with her cutting ties with him.</p>, <p>That was five years ago.</p>, <p>\"....You know, I thought he could've changed.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn let out a strained laugh.</p>, <p>\"I was naive, wasn't I...? In the end, it's always like this... H-hah.\"</p>, <p>Her chest trembled.</p>, <p>So did her lips.</p>, <p>\"Disappointment after another.\"</p>, <p>Her lips were tucked under her teeth.</p>, <p>\"...In the end, I was made fun of by him.\"</p>, <p>She looked up to face Natasha. Unlike before, her eyes seemed a little clearer but they were still a little misty.</p>, <p>Natasha's grip on her sword tightened.</p>, <p>That bastard...</p>, <p>\"Do you know what he said to me?\"</p>, <p>Natasha shook her head.</p>, <p>\"....Why don't they play poker in the jungle?\"</p>, <p>\"Yes?\"</p>, <p>Natasha blinked, unable to understand what was going on. Poker? Jungle...?</p>, <p>But Evelyn continued.</p>, <p>\"Too many cheetahs.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's shoulders trembled as she lowered her head. Natasha's expression changed all of a sudden.</p>, <p>\"Young misss...?\"</p>, <p>Fearing the worst, she approached her.</p>, <p>\"Are yo-\"</p>, <p>But stopped herself halfway.</p>, <p>That was because,</p>, <p>\"Uht.\"</p>, <p>Uth...?</p>, <p>\"Young miss...?\"</p>, <p>Holding her mouth, a strained sound escaped Evelyn's lips. Natasha was taken aback. What's going on...? And just before she could do anything, Evelyn's shoulders trembled even more.</p>, <p>\"Young...?\"</p>, <p>\"....Kaht.\"</p>, <p>Khat...?</p>, <p>Another sound came out of her mouth.</p>, <p>Natasha felt her stomach drop.</p>, <p>\"What-\"</p>, <p>Her hand reached out for her, when...</p>, <p>\"Puchi...!\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's cheek's deflated and a laugh escaped her lips.</p>, <p>\"Hehe-he\"</p>, <p>Even her laugh seemed strained. She looked up at Natasha, tears rolling down her eyes.</p>, <p>\"I do-n't even know what is happening to me...\"</p>, <p>A sharp pain pierced her chest as she continued to laugh.</p>, <p>Her hand reached to her shirt and clenched it.</p>, <p>\"W-why am I like this...? Hehe... The joke is bad so why...\"</p>, <p>She looked helplessly at Natasha. The tears continued to roll down her eyes, and the pain in her chest intensified.</p>, <p>\"He... Hehe, why can't I stop laughing...?\"</p>]\n",

Besides the speech, we were introduced to our dorm rooms.</p>, <p>Because of my situation, I was introduced to the dorms before the others. As such, I was separated from Leon.</p>, <p>It was a good thing.</p>, <p>Thinking back at his expression my face nearly crumbled.</p>, <p>\"Here's the key. You'll need it to access your dorm.\"</p>, <p>I stood silently to observe the building.</p>, <p>The Rondeo Building. With over ten floors, it looked rather grand.</p>, <p>It was indeed a building fitting the top ranker.</p>, <p>\"Cadet Julien?\"</p>, <p>I finally took note of the black card near me.</p>, <p>\".....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>It seemed nothing fancy.</p>, <p>Just a plain old metallic card.</p>, <p>\"If you need anything else from me, please feel free to inform me.\"</p>, <p>\"I will.\"</p>, <p>As I entered the building, I climbed the stairs and headed to the last floor. That was where my room was.</p>, <p>Being the number one rank did have its perks.</p>, <p>\"This should be it.\"</p>, <p>A tall wooden door met my sight.</p>, <p>I didn't hesitate to swipe my card, unlocking the door to the room.</p>, <p>\"....Wow.\"</p>, <p>It wasn't as though I didn't expect it, but...</p>, <p>\"It's big.\"</p>, <p>The place was grand. A lot bigger than I could've possibly imagined. Sizable windows adorned the space at one end, granting me a view of the huge garden below.</p>, <p>Sofas and an array of decorations throughout the room complemented the room.</p>, <p>On any normal occasion, I would've taken my time to explore the place more.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, I wasn't someone who could afford to waste time.</p>, <p>\"Haah...\"</p>, <p>I sat down on the ground.</p>, <p>And went ahead with my training. My mind was tired, and so was my body. Even so, I had no choice but to push away the fatigue and train.</p>, <p>I was the one who pushed myself to this point.</p>, <p>I had to own up to my choices.</p>, <p>Tzz</p>, <p>I failed on the first try.</p>, <p> \"Again....\"</p>, <p>But I didn't lose hope.</p>, <p>I had no choice but to continue.</p>, <p>Once again, this was what I had done to myself.</p>, <p>The current spell I was practicing was called [Hands of Malady]. It was an elemental spell that belonged to the Curse element.</p>, <p>Being a beginner-type spell, its difficulty wasn't very high.</p>, <p>From what Leon told me, spells were classified into five different ranks—beginner, intermediate, advanced, superior, and perfected.</p>, <p>What set the spells apart was the number of runes each spell contained.</p>, <p>[Hands of Malady], being a beginner-type spell, only had twelve runes.</p>, <p>My goal was to connect each rune before fully forming a magic circle.</p>, <p>Which I have yet to achieve.</p>, <p>So long as I managed to connect all twelve and complete the circle, the spell would activate, and I'd be able to summon the spell whenever I wanted.</p>, <p>The key point was that I had to complete the circle before using it.</p>, <p>Tzz</p>, <p>But things weren't going very smoothly.</p>, <p>\"Another failure....\"</p>, <p>I had managed to connect four of the twelve runes.</p>, <p>I didn't lose hope.</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>Mana flowed out from my abdomen.

Haaaa.... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>And I heavily gulped for air.</p>, <p>The consequences of my actions finally caught up to me.</p>, <p>I lost control of my body.</p>, <p>It trembled furiously on the ground.</p>, <p>\"Kh...!

Therefore, it was hard for me to remain focused.</p>, <p>It took several deep breaths before I could finally concentrate again.</p>, <p>Several things jumped out the moment I laid my eyes on the screen.</p>, <p>\"Exp...? Level 17. Tier 1 Magician?\"</p>, <p>As expected, this was similar to a game system. I wasn't much of a gamer, but I understood the concept of levels and Exp.</p>, <p>Magicians were divided in ten tiers.</p>, <p>From what I knew, the classification went as this;</p>, <p>Tier 1-2 : Apprentice</p>, <p>Tier 3-4 : Master-Mage</p>, <p>Tier 5-6 : High-Wizard</p>, <p>Tier 7-8 : Arch-Wizard</p>, <p>Tier 9 : Monarch</p>, <p>Tier 10 : Zenith</p>, <p>\"Level 17... So I'm Tier 1.\"</p>, <p>That was an interesting piece of information. For one to test their Tier, they needed a special orb that Leon told me about it.</p>, <p>For the past week I had been curious about my Tier.</p>, <p>While I was aware through Leon that I had reached Tier 1. What I wasn't aware of was the fact that,</p>, <p>\"I'm on the verge of Tier 2.\"</p>, <p>Who would've thought...?</p>, <p>Or was I?</p>, <p>I felt my brows slowly come together into a knit.</p>, <p>\"I'm level seventeen and Tier 1. Is it safe to assume that my Tier changes with every ten levels?\"</p>, <p>It sounded logical, but...</p>, <p>\"I'll need to observe.\"</p>, <p>There was no proof of my judgment. For now, I decided to pay close attention to it. When the time came, I'd be able to know if my assumption was correct or not.</p>, <p>My gaze shifted down.</p>, <p>\"Spell list...\"</p>, <p>I wasn't surprised by the spells listed in front of me.</p>, <p>[Hands of Malady] was a spell I was already practicing. It was Leon who had told me about it.</p>, <p>What I was surprised about, however, was what was written beneath it.</p>, <p>\"Ah...\"</p>, <p>Innate skill.</p>, <p>Insight.</p>, <p>\"....That explains it.\"</p>, <p>An answer to one of my questions had finally been answered.</p>, <p>The reasoning behind the vision. It was all due to this skill. The thought made me frown, and several more questions arose in my mind.</p>, <p>\"Is there some sort of trigger to these visions? Can I activate it whenever I want?\"</p>, <p>I thought back to the vision I just had.</p>, <p>'....How low has Haven fallen for them to select someone as incompetent as you?'</p>, <p>'Not only are you incapable of using any spells, but you even went ahead and challenged everyone with that puny arrogance of yours.'</p>, <p>'It's no wonder you lost your first duel.'</p>, <p>'I should probably end this.'</p>, <p>'.....There are other more important people I need to take care of.'</p>, <p>His cold voice echoed at the back of my mind.</p>, <p>My hand unconsciously trembled at the thought. The sensation I felt back in the visions... I could still feel it vividly in my mind.</p>, <p>It sent shivers down my spine.</p>, <p>And.</p>, <p>\"I need to train.\"</p>, <p>Reminded me yet again about my situation.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa...\"</p>, <p>I sat down on the ground and shifted my right hand forward.</p>, <p>Closing my eyes, I channeled my mana.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>I swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</p>, <p>\".....Alright.\"</p>, <p>I swallowed again.</p>, <p>\"Let's start.\"</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"...Come.\"</p>, <p>Nothing came out of my hand.</p>, <p>I could feel the mana in my core.</p>, <p>It was there.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"I've got to do it.\"</p>, <p>It just wouldn't flow.</p>, <p>\"....Why?\"</p>, <p>My hand started to visibly tremble.</p>, <p>So did my lips.</p>, <p>\"He-h... Come on... Come out.\"</p>, <p>I thought back at what I did in the past.</p>, <p>I tried to repeat it.</p>, <p>Having done it hundreds of times over the past week, surely I could do it, right?</p>, <p>But.</p>, <p>\"...It's not coming out.\"</p>, <p>The mana simply refused to move along my body.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I knew the reason why.</p>, <p>I just didn't want to acknowledge it.</p>, <p>\"...C-come on. Just a little.\"</p>, <p>I swallowed yet again.</p>, <p>\"No... N-no.\"</p>, <p>My mind kept wandering back to moments ago.</p>, <p>When I failed.</p>, <p>And the pain that came after it.</p>, <p>It replayed in my mind.</p>, <p>Over.</p>, <p>And over again.</p>, <p>\"...It's nothing.\"</p>, <p>As if it was a tape on replay.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>In the end.</p>, <p>I was afraid.</p>, <p>Afraid of my efforts going to waste like before.</p>, <p>\"What am I even doing this for...?\"</p>, <p>To the point where I started to question my own objectives.</p>, <p>Why was I doing so much?</p>, <p>Was it because I was just that desperate for answers? Was that the reason why I was pushing myself so hard?</p>, <p>For answers?</p>, <p>Was I really someone who would push themselves to this point just for answers?</p>, <p>\"....No.\"</p>, <p>How laughable.</p>, <p>Of course, it wasn't.</p>, <p>Deep down, I knew the answer. Why I was pushing myself so hard. Even if it was at the cost of my own sanity and body.</p>, <p>\"Go back.\"</p>, <p>The words escaped from my lips.</p>, <p>Almost as if they were in a whisper.</p>, <p>\"Brother.\"</p>, <p>An image conjured in my mind.</p>, <p>One of a young boy.</p>, <p>Sixteen years old.</p>, <p>And alone.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>What I wanted wasn't an answer.</p>, <p>It was a way back.</p>, <p>I...</p>, <p>\"Kh...!\"</p>, <p>Mana flowed out from my core.</p>, <p>My entire body shivered as a result. The world started to become a blur, and I could hardly make out what was real and what was fake.</p>, <p>But that didn't deter me from training.</p>, <p>I had a goal in mind.</p>, <p>One that I had to achieve.</p>, <p>So even though I was afraid. My body hurt. And I was exhausted.</p>, <p>\"....Kh.\"</p>, <p>I continued to push myself.</p>, <p>I had no choice.</p>, <p>I...</p>, <p>Had to do it.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>A plume of smoke floated in the air.</p>, <p>Long flowing platinum hair, deep red eyes, curvaceous body. Kiera Mylne casually sat on the stairs of the Rondeo Dorms.</p>, <p>It was a building only the top rankers were allowed to be in.</p>, <p>She was one of them.</p>, <p>That said,</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>They didn't allow one to smoke inside.</p>, <p>She had no choice but to smoke outside.</p>, <p>\"...Fucking bullshit.\"</p>, <p>It was an irritating thought. For such a grand and luxurious building... How could they not allow her to smoke?</p>, <p>Like, seriously.</p>, <p>What did she pay so much to attend this place for?</p>, <p>\"Maybe if I was the Black Star....\"</p>, <p>She thought back to the Black Star. Julien of the Evenus Barony. Maybe he could smoke in his room?</p>, <p>It was a thought that entertained her for a bit.</p>, <p>At first glance, he seemed quite arrogant.</p>, <p>Enough to infuriate practically every first-year cadet.</p>, <p>But unlike the others, she wasn't particularly interested in such meaningless squabbles.</p>, <p>\"Pfttt.\"</p>, <p>Rather, she found him to be somewhat funny.</p>, <p>\"Fucking jokes.\"</p>, <p>*Puff*</p>, <p>The plume of smoke drifted in the air as she took another drag of the cigarette.</p>, <p>Kiera, who was enjoying herself at the steps of the building, suddenly raised her head, catching a glimpse of an approaching figure.</p>, <p>She was quick to flick the cigarette away.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>There was a certain aura about the approaching figure that attracted the gazes of all those around. Her graceful movements exuded a sense of authority, flowing with sophistication and ease, concealing any hint of her flaws.</p>, <p>It was a figure she knew all too well. How could she not know her...?</p>, <p>A woman of the Megrail family.</p>, <p>The Princess of the Empire.</p>, <p>Aoife Kell Megrail.</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>Though she was in a class of her own, Kiera couldn't help but click her tongue. Her foot dragged over to where the cigarette was and she stepped on it.</p>, <p>Twisting her foot slightly.</p>, <p>Kiera looked down on her. As a noble of high lineage, she was well acquainted with Aoife. They had met many times in past events.</p>, <p>She shone brightly wherever she went. Was always the spotlight.</p>, <p>That didn't bother Kiera much.</p>, <p>...Not until the day of her coming to age ceremony and her talent was made known to Aoife and the royal family.</p>, <p>As a result?</p>, <p>She, who was supposed to have started her training at age fourteen, was forced to train at seventeen. The same age as low-end nobles.</p>, <p>For what reason...?</p>, <p>'This bitch.'</p>, <p>\"Cadet.\"</p>, <p>Aoife stopped in front of her. Her yellow eyes slowly sank down to meet Kiera's gaze. Her expression didn't say much.</p>, <p>It was hard to read.</p>, <p>There was nothing unusual about this. She had always been like this. A blank piece of paper with hardly any thoughts.</p>, <p>And the thought irritated Kiera even more.</p>, <p>\"....What.\"</p>, <p>\"Can you move?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh?\"</p>, <p>Kiera blinked and looked around. Then she realized. She was blocking the entrance.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'Is that all....?'</p>, <p>No form of acknowledgment. A name? Just... Cadet? They had met several times in the past. Even made brief conversation. It was complete disregard.</p>, <p>\"Cadet?\"</p>, <p>\"Hehe.\"</p>, <p>Kiera pursed her lips and smiled. It was a bright smile. One of the brightest she had ever displayed.</p>, <p>And what followed after her smile was...</p>, <p>\"Fuck you.\"</p>, <p>A middle finger.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>Sweat intermixed with my blood.</p>, <p>My eyes stung.</p>, <p>And my vision was blurred.</p>, <p>A day had passed. It was now early in the morning.</p>, <p>And...</p>, <p>Tzz----</p>, <p>\"....Failed.\"</p>, <p>I was met with another failure.</p>, <p>The result of my efforts was the connection of eight runes. A result that was far beneath my desired goal.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I thought about continuing again, when...</p>, <p>To Tok--!</p>, <p>The door knocked.</p>, <p>\"Young master.\"</p>, <p>And a familiar voice sounded.</p>, <p>\"...So it's time.\"</p>, <p>There could only be one reason for him to call me. The first day of the Academy was about to start.</p>, <p>\"I'm comin-Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>Thump!</p>, <p>My legs gave out when I tried to stand up.</p>, <p>Fortunately, I was able to stop myself from falling face flat on the floor by grasping the side of the sofa.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My breaths were heavy and my hands were unusually pale.</p>, <p>It was obvious that my body was in poor condition.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Taking another breath I forced myself into the shower. I stumbled several times in the process before finally making it to the valve where I turned on the cold water.</p>, <p>Shaaa--!</p>, <p>My skin prickled at the cold.</p>, <p>But at the same time, my mind regained some clarity.</p>, <p>Supporting myself with both hands on the wall, I let the water trickle down my back.</p>, <p>One might think I'd be distressed with the results of my training.</p>, <p>In some ways I was.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Almost.\"</p>, <p>At the same time, I was also thrilled.</p>, <p>It wasn't fruitless.</p>, <p>There was definitely a progression.</p>, <p>\"Haha.\"</p>, <p>I laughed out in exasperation.</p>, <p>It was going to take time, but I knew I could do it.</p>, <p>I was that desperate.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>The campus was large. It took me about five minutes to get to the main building from the dorms.</p>, <p>[Dorset Hall]</p>, <p>That was where we were supposed to be.</p>, <p>It was one of the seven halls of the institute and where first-year cadets attended their lessons.</p>, <p>\".....What class are we in?\"</p>, <p>The Hall was large.</p>, <p>It was one big building with a pathway flanked by vibrant flowers and trees that guided toward the entrance, where a row of statues stood in solemn formation.</p>, <p>It overflowed with students.</p>, <p>Most troublesome were the gazes they looked at me with. Some avoided me, while others seemed to be openly hostile.</p>, <p>I was fine with that.</p>, <p>It came as a result of my actions on the first day.</p>, <p>\"Our class should be there.\"</p>, <p>Leon pointed towards a certain door. At first glance, it didn't seem all that impressive.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Why is there nobody going there?\"</p>, <p>Unlike the other classrooms, which were open and filled with cadets passing through, this one seemed rather isolated. As if people were avoiding it.</p>, <p>\"....Did you not read the manual?\"</p>, <p>\"Manual...? Ah.\"</p>, <p>I took a small leaflet from my pocket. I remember receiving it yesterday, but because my focus had been on my training, I forgot all about it.</p>, <p>\"This?\"</p>, <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>, <p>I scanned through the contents.</p>, <p>In short.</p>, <p>\"We're late.\"</p>, <p>\".....That's right.\"</p>, <p>\"And you didn't tell me about it?\"</p>, <p>\"I thought you were aware.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>There were times when I just really wanted to strangle this guy.</p>, <p>If not for the fact that he was helping me and that he was stronger, I'd already be at it.</p>, <p>That said,</p>, <p>'I wonder what his end goal is...'</p>, <p>I was still not sure why he was helping me. He said something about it benefiting him.</p>, <p>How so?</p>, <p>'As expected, I still can't trust him.'</p>, <p> The same was true for him to me.</p>, <p>In a way, we weren't that much different.</p>, <p>Staring at the door to the classroom, I sighed.</p>, <p>I felt strangely nervous. It wasn't so much because I was scared of people challenging me. I was fine with that. What I was nervous about was my abilities.</p>, <p>They were not up to par at that moment.</p>, <p>I was probably the weakest cadet present.</p>, <p>\"Huu.\"</p>, <p>After secretly collecting my breath, I slowly and carefully approached the door.</p>, <p>Creaaak--</p>, <p>The interior was sleek; long wooden desks lined up the sides, cascading up. They were all filled to the brim, with barely any empty spots.</p>, <p>Immediately, all eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>They were burdensome. But the most burdensome of them all was the one that belonged to the woman in front of me.</p>, <p>Most likely, our instructor.</p>, <p>\"Cadets.\"</p>, <p>Her crystal blue eyes shifted between Leon and me. She had short brown hair and seemed to be in her mid-forties.</p>, <p>Alternating her gaze between the two of us she finally opened her mouth to say,</p>, <p>\"....You're late.\"</p>, <p>I was already aware.</p>, <p>Things would've been easier if I just apologized, but I recalled Leon's description of the previous Julien and answered flatly,</p>, <p>\"That seems to be the case.\"</p>, <p>\"Seems to be the case...?\"</p>, <p>My answer left her exasperated as she made a face. I felt a little sorry for her, but I didn't show it on the outside and kept my face stoic.</p>, <p>She opened her mouth but closed it right after.</p>, <p>\"Just go. Take a seat.\"</p>, <p>\".....Thank you.\"</p>, <p>I did just that.</p>, <p>Finding the nearest seat I could find, I sat down and took a breath.</p>, <p>That was easier than I expected.</p>, <p>She was probably a lenient teacher. Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"You're late! Get out of my class!\"</p>, <p>Staring at the student who had just entered the class and got kicked out, I opened my mouth to say something when I realized I couldn't say anything.</p>, <p>Why....?</p>, <p>I looked to my left, where Leon sat. He looked at me and then shrugged.</p>, <p>\"Probably our looks.\"</p>, <p>Oh.</p>, <p>The lecture resumed.</p>, <p>\"Continuing from where I was... As you all are currently aware, magic is subdivided into three different categories. [Mind], [Elemental], and [Body].\"</p>, <p>The classroom fell into silence.</p>, <p>The instructor's voice smoothly echoed throughout the classroom.</p>, <p>\"Each category is further divided into subcategories. Take the [Mind] classification as an example. With the [Emotive], [Telekinesis], [Spirit], and [Telepathy] it contains a total of four sub-categories. Or some like to say, 'paths'.\"</p>, <p>I strained my ears to listen closely to the lecture. All information was vital. I needed to pay close attention to all that was being said.</p>, <p>\"....As is known, everyone can practice magic. If you can manipulate mana, you have the qualifications to become a magician or knight. That of course, isn't a problem for all of you present.\"</p>, <p>She seemed to eye certain students; her gaze eventually falling on me.</p>, <p>\"Talent is merely a factor that indicates the rate of your improvement. It does not limit you in the practice of other paths.\"</p>, <p>I took note of this piece of information in my mind.</p>, <p>My talents currently lie in the [Curse] and [Emotive] subcategories.</p>, <p>If it was possible for me to practice things outside of those two categories, then it was worth considering for the future.</p>, <p>\"Now, time for a question.\"</p>, <p>The lecturer looked around the classroom. I felt her gaze linger in my direction for a brief moment.</p>, <p>What sort of...?</p>, <p>She smiled.</p>, <p>\"Of all the categories, which do you deem to be the weakest?\"</p>, <p>The weakest?</p>, <p>Murmurs filled the classroom as the students discussed among themselves.</p>, <p>Eventually, one of the cadets raised their hands. He stood out immediately with his tall height, blonde hair, and blue eyes.</p>, <p>The fact that his appearance garnered the attention of many of the people present told me all that I needed to know about him.</p>, <p>He was strong.</p>, <p>Probably amongst the higher-ranked cadets.</p>, <p>\"Yes? Cadet Anders.\"</p>, <p>Oh?</p>, <p>I suddenly felt his gaze.</p>, <p>As his mouth parted open, he answered slowly. As if he wanted me to hear his answer.</p>, <p>\"....Emotive.\"</p>, <p>A clear provocation.</p>, <p>Multiple eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>\"Emotive?\"</p>, <p>The instructor's gaze fell on me for a moment. She seemed to have been influenced by the others in the class.</p>, <p>\"What makes you think that's the case?\"</p>, <p>\"It's the longest category to learn. Not only that, but you must be able to touch your opponent to influence their emotions. If they can't touch you, they're useless.\"</p>, <p>\"That's not the case.\"</p>, <p>With a shake of her head, the instructor corrected,</p>, <p>\"That's merely on the basis that they are on the first level of mastery. At a higher stage, they can influence someone with mere words. Further down the path, and they can read emotions.\"</p>, <p>I listened to her words carefully.</p>, <p>The [Emotive] sub-category was still an enigma to me. Unlike with my [Curse] sub-category, I couldn't practice it through repetition training.</p>, <p>The only way for me to further the [Emotive] path was through the understanding of emotions. The more I understood, the more I improved.</p>, <p>But that was easier said than done.</p>, <p>'Now that I think about it... She mentioned something about first-level mastery.'</p>, <p>I was reminded of the notifications I received almost daily.</p>, <p>The only regarding [Fear] and Exp.</p>, <p>'....So if I improve it, I'll be able to influence people with words?'</p>, <p>The thought excited me for some reason.</p>, <p>Was there more to it?</p>, <p>The Cadet continued,</p>, <p>\"That is indeed true, but it's also true that it's not easy to achieve. It may take a lot of years to get to a level where one can influence another's emotions. To be able to influence them through words?\"</p>, <p>He scoffed.</p>, <p>\"...You will need to be as old as my father to be able to get there.\"</p>, <p>\"That's not necessarily true.\"</p>, <p>The instructor shook her head.</p>, <p>\"There are many cases where people achieve such a state at a young age. Keep in mind, that there are states above that. Being able to influence someone through words is still considered entry level.\"</p>, <p>Entry level...?</p>, <p>Influencing with words was just entry-level?</p>, <p>I thought back to my powers. Ever since the examination, I had hardly touched the other field.</p>, <p>It wasn't because I didn't like it.</p>, <p>That was the furthest thing from the truth.</p>, <p>The reality was that I was unsure whether I was capable of handling it. The after-effect from last time left a scar in my mind.</p>, <p>Like a mental block, it made me avoid it.</p>, <p>I was just not ready.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>'You're telling me I merely scratched the surface of what's possible?'</p>, <p>\"Cadet Julien.\"</p>, <p>Feeling the instructor's gaze, I turned to face her.</p>, <p>\"....As an Emotive Mage yourself, what do you think about Cadet Anders's answer?\"</p>, <p>What did I think about it?</p>, <p>He's right.</p>, <p>All his words made sense. From what I experienced, he was right in absolutely every way.</p>, <p>The [Emotive] field was a path that would probably take someone ages to master.</p>, <p>It encompassed all the experiences of one's life and molded them in the form of emotions. Unless someone constantly experiences all those emotions, they won't be able to improve.</p>, <p>In that regard, it was the weakest of all the other paths.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I turned my wrist slightly.</p>, <p>My eyes fell on the clover tattoo.</p>, <p>Was that the same for me?</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>The classroom fell silent.</p>, <p>They all were seemingly awaiting my answer. 'What's he going to say?', 'How will he answer with?'</p>, <p>Their faces all said the same thing.</p>, <p>And I looked back to face the cadet.</p>, <p>Anders was it?</p>, <p>I found the corner of my lips lifting slightly.</p>, <p>\"....It's bullshit.\"</p>, <p>An answer flowed out of my mouth.</p>, <p>\"Weakest? There's no such thing.\"</p>, <p>I wasn't just bullshitting at the moment.</p>, <p>These were my true thoughts.</p>, <p>\"There's only a weak person. No weak path.\"</p>, <p>Just because the Emotive field was the hardest to progress in didn't mean it was the weakest class.</p>, <p>From the start, the question was wrong.</p>, <p>\"You say that it takes a lot of time for an Emotive mage to be strong. On what basis do you say that?\"</p>, <p>\"What basis?\"</p>, <p>The Cadet looked at me as if I were stupid.</p>, <p>\"It's common sense. Take a look at all the strongest mages in the world. Our Empire has seven Monarchs. How many of them are from the Emotive field? None!\"</p>, <p>He pointed his finger at me.</p>, <p>All of a sudden, he started talking about something different.</p>, <p>Most probably what he wanted to say from the start.</p>, <p>\".....Do you think none of us see it? Your mana flow is weak. You don't even seem to be capable of properly controlling your mana. On good god, I don't know why you're ranked first.\"</p>, <p>His words seemed to echo the thoughts of many of the people present in the classroom, with many of them nodding along.</p>, <p>I took in the sight.</p>, <p>\"My best guess is because of your achievements in the Emotive field. Even then, I doubt you'll be able to do anything to me.\"</p>, <p>When he finally said what he wanted to say, with a look of scorn, he added,</p>, <p>\"Simply put, you're not fit for the role. You're weak.\"</p>, <p>Once again, the room fell into silence.</p>, <p>All eyes were trained on me.</p>, <p>\"Haaa....\"</p>, <p>With all attention on me, I leaned my head back and closed my eyes.</p>, <p>'....So they noticed.'</p>, <p>It wasn't as though I didn't expect it.</p>, <p>Everyone must've noticed it during the first day. The fact that I was weak. That I wasn't on the same level as them.</p>, <p>I understood this even more clearly than they did.</p>, <p>It was for this reason that I provoked everyone.</p>, <p>Trained to the point of insanity.</p>, <p>His words made sense, and there was nothing wrong with them.</p>, <p>Still,</p>, <p>\"You're wrong.\"</p>, <p>My eyes were still closed, so I couldn't see.</p>, <p>All that I saw was darkness.</p>, <p>In that darkness, I could feel my hand move towards my forearm. Where the four-leaved clover rested.</p>, <p>I was a little hesitant at first, but then, I was reminded of my goal.</p>, <p>That was when my mind became firm.</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>To achieve my goal, I need to make full use of all the advantages I have.</p>, <p>Therefore...</p>, <p>My finger pressed down on my forearm.</p>, <p>'...Nobody but me can be the Black Star.'</p>]\n",

My scenery slowly started to change, and my body sank in what seemed to be a... sofa?</p>, <p>Uh?</p>, <p>Gradually, an environment started to form.</p>, <p>My chest felt heavy all of a sudden.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Enough to make me want to take a deep breath.</p>, <p>\"....Why?\"</p>, <p>I licked my lips.</p>, <p>They were dry.</p>, <p>My mouth trembled.</p>, <p>\"W-why am I back here...?\"</p>, <p>Home.</p>, <p>This place I was all too familiar with.</p>, <p>It was home.</p>, <p>The place I lived before coming to this world.</p>, <p>\"H-hah.\"</p>, <p>The pain in my chest intensified. One that was accompanied by a sense of emptiness. I... missed this place. I knew it was fake. A fabric of the skill I was using.</p>, <p>....That's why it hurt.</p>, <p>Because I knew it wasn't real.</p>, <p>\"Shit.\"</p>, <p>Click—</p>, <p>The door opened and a familiar figure entered.</p>, <p>\"Noel...?\"</p>, <p> \"Yo, I'm back brother.\"</p>, <p>He looked no different than I last remembered. With his usual smile, he walked up to the desk set up in the living room.</p>, <p>My fingers twisted.</p>, <p>\"I've got some takeaway. Kinda expensive, but worth it. Damn Chinese place is so tasty~...I think I'm addicted.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>The Chinese place.</p>, <p>Right.</p>, <p>It was his favorite place.</p>, <p>He glanced back and smirked.</p>, <p>\"Ay~ I got some for you as well. Don't make such a face.\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>I opened my mouth but found myself unable to speak. The words just refused to leave my mouth.</p>, <p>All of this...</p>, <p>It felt so real.</p>, <p>'Could it be that all that I experienced was fake...?'</p>, <p>Deep down, I knew that it didn't make sense. The pain I felt. The frustration I felt. And everything that I experienced.</p>, <p>Was that really fake?</p>, <p>All of it?</p>, <p>\"Brother?\"</p>, <p>Noel turned around. His usual smile was there. Carrying the plate, he walked in my direction before eventually stopping in front of me.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I studied his face closely.</p>, <p>\"Here.\"</p>, <p>And I realized.</p>, <p>\"Eat well.\"</p>, <p>He wasn't looking at me.</p>, <p>The plate phased through my body, calmly resting on the sofa.</p>, <p>\".....Make sure you eat well.\"</p>, <p>He then calmly went back to the table and started eating, his back facing me.</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>My heart squeezed. The emotions I felt were wholly mine. It wasn't like last time when they were injected into me.</p>, <p>I felt a sharp pain like my heart was being stabbed. My breath caught, as if my air passages were being crushed...</p>, <p>All because of the simple fact that,</p>, <p>\"...It's good, right?\"</p>, <p>My brother's shoulders were shaking.</p>, <p>It was strange. In my mind, I knew this was fake. There's no way my brother would act this way. But... was that really the case?</p>, <p>Was what I was seeing truly fake?...Or was this the reality of his life now?</p>, <p>\"Y-you're enjoying your food?\"</p>, <p>He never looked back.</p>, <p>It was as if he couldn't look back.</p>, <p>But I could see it.</p>, <p>His shoulders... They were shaking. Even more than before.</p>, <p>\".....Why?\"</p>, <p>I was running out of breath, and my vision blurred. A pain unlike any other invaded my body.</p>, <p>Why did it have to be like this?</p>, <p>Rustle</p>, <p>A rustling caught my attention.</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>If not for the fact that I was rooted on the spot, I would've stood up immediately.</p>, <p>\"Noel!\"</p>, <p>I shouted at the top of my lungs. Panic flooded every part of me as I tried to wrestle against the chains that kept me on the seat.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>My voice didn't reach him.</p>, <p>\"Stop! Stop now!!! You can't...!\"</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>It couldn't reach him.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Against his temple, Noel held a gun.</p>, <p>\"No, no, no, no, no...\"</p>, <p>What was this?</p>, <p>What am I seeing?</p>, <p>How did he...</p>, <p>Ahhhh.</p>, <p>\"Heyyy!!!\"</p>, <p>It was as if a piece of my heart was being torn. Scraped off. My neck twisted, and the veins on my neck protruded.</p>, <p>\"What are you doing!?\"</p>, <p>Stop!</p>, <p>Stop....!</p>, <p>\".....I'm tired.\"</p>, <p>Noel remained motionless.</p>, <p>His voice seemed to be devoid of anything. As if he had lost track of himself.</p>, <p>\"No, don't! I... Ah!\"</p>, <p>\"Hey, brother...\"</p>, <p>Finally, he turned to look at me.</p>, <p>That was when I stopped my struggles.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>His face was stained with tears. But the scariest part was his eyes... They were empty. Devoid of any of the usual spark he had.</p>, <p>Ah, no...</p>, <p>\".....Why did you leave me?\"</p>, <p>I knew he wasn't addressing me. There was nobody in the room. It was just him. He was talking to himself.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I felt compelled to respond.</p>, <p>\"I didn't choose to leave.\"</p>, <p>\"Right, you had no choice.\"</p>, <p>He answered in a manner that suggested he could hear me. But I knew he couldn't.</p>, <p>After all, he wasn't looking at me.</p>, <p>\"It's cold. Lonely. I have nobody. Our parents died. You were the only one left. Now that you're gone... Nobody cares.\"</p>, <p>\"....Ah.\"</p>, <p>My chest pounded.</p>, <p>The pain seemed to strangle the words out of me.</p>, <p>\"I-I'm scared...\"</p>, <p>Drip.</p>, <p>\"I don't know what to do... Why does everyone leave me...? What did I do? Am I the problem... Is that it?\"</p>, <p>No, that's not...</p>, <p>\"Hehe...\"</p>, <p>A hollow laugh escaped his lips.</p>, <p>\".....I should just end it, right? That way... I won't be alone anymore. At worst, I'll be with darkness. It's nothing different than now.\"</p>, <p>\"No!!\"</p>, <p>I finally snapped out of it.</p>, <p>What replaced the pain that entangled my heart was another emotion.</p>, <p>Anger.</p>, <p>I knew he couldn't listen, but I still spoke.</p>, <p>No, shouted.</p>, <p>\"You fucking idiot...!! I stopped everything so that you could live better.\"</p>, <p>My chemotherapy.</p>, <p>.....I stopped it because I wanted him to live a better life. He had enough savings to survive until he finished school. So... how could he just end it?</p>, <p>Was my sacrifice for nothing!?</p>, <p>No, no...!</p>, <p>\"Fuck!!! Stop!\"</p>, <p>\".....If you were here, you'd probably scold me. Tell me how much of a fucking idiot I am, right?\"</p>, <p>I lost my voice then.</p>, <p>\"Did I ask you to step chemo? Do you think I've ever cared about the money...?\"</p>, <p>No, that's...</p>, <p>\"That was just an excuse from you wasn't it?\"</p>, <p>\"....What?\"</p>, <p>\"You were scared.\"</p>, <p>I felt myself lose my breath.</p>, <p>\".....No.\"</p>, <p>\"You stopped chemo because you lost sight of yourself. You were afraid of spending your days meaninglessly, knowing that you had no future to look forward to. You chose the fastest way to leave. Leaving money for me... That was just an excuse you probably told yourself.\"</p>, <p>\"No, that's...\"</p>, <p>\".....I know it. After all, I'm just like you now.\"</p>, <p>That...</p>, <p>I brought my hand toward my chest.</p>, <p>It hurt.</p>, <p>It hurt so much.</p>, <p>The pain was taking over me.</p>, <p>\"Haaa.... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My vision blurred, and every single breath was accompanied by even more pain.</p>, <p>Noel's hand shook.</p>, <p>\"...Since you can run, I can too, right?\"</p>, <p>He looked at me.</p>, <p>This time, it really felt like he could see me.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Tears, uninvited, welled up, and my mouth trembled. What was this? How could speaking hurt so much...?</p>, <p>\"You won't mind if I join you, right?\"</p>, <p>\"....No, no.\"</p>, <p>My voice came out weak.</p>, <p>I found that I could no longer shout. The energy drained from my body. This sense of helplessness...</p>, <p>It slowly carved itself into my mind.</p>, <p>So did the pain.</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>Noel smiled. In a way, his smile seemed liberating. But all I could feel was helplessness. I could feel myself breaking.</p>, <p>The colors started to drain from the world.</p>, <p>I could see the younger version of him, standing before me, asking me to buy him ice cream. It was just a couple of months after our parent's death.</p>, <p>It was just the two of us back then.</p>, <p>He had only been ten back then. I remember that day clearly because... That was the day he regained his smile.</p>, <p>I worked hard to keep it that way.</p>, <p>To make it so that he wouldn't stop smiling.</p>, <p>So...</p>, <p>Staring at the sight before me, I felt myself lose my breath.</p>, <p>His smile. The one I promised to keep.</p>, <p>It was gone.</p>, <p>I took it away from him.</p>, <p>\"It... hurts.\"</p>, <p>Clank—!</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>I flinched. My breath seemed to be caught in my throat as the gun fell from Noel's hand. His eyes, which appeared to be devoid of any light, lowered.</p>, <p>Drip... Drip...</p>, <p>And tears continuously poured down from them.</p>, <p>Biting his lips, he weakly leaned back.</p>, <p>\"I... I'm scared.\"</p>, <p>He covered his face with both hands.</p>, <p>\"I don't want to die.\"</p>, <p>His shoulders trembled.</p>, <p>\"...But I don't want to live.\"</p>, <p>The world seemed to grow faint.</p>, <p>\"W-what do I do...?\"</p>, <p>Just before it all faded, his head turned to face my direction once more.</p>, <p>\"....Tell me, brother. What do I do?\"</p>, <p>That was the last time I heard his voice.</p>, <p>Brightness engulfed my vision and I found myself in a familiar place.</p>, <p>All eyes were fixed on me.</p>, <p>\"H-hah...\"</p>, <p>But all I could feel was pain.</p>, <p>My chest felt tight and heavy.</p>, <p>Each breath felt heavier than the last.</p>, <p>And my vision was blurry.</p>, <p>It was at that point that I closed my eyes and saw a notification.</p>, <p>∎ Lvl 2. [Sadness] EXP + 15%</p>, <p>'Level 2...?'</p>, <p>At first, I was surprised, but then I understood.</p>, <p>Unlike fear, I was familiar with sadness. It was all I ever knew in my previous life. It was no wonder my understanding of it was greater than fear or any other emotion.</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, I opened my eyes.</p>, <p>\"...When was the last time that you cried?\"</p>, <p>Words flowed out of my mouth all of a sudden. They came out smoother than I thought.</p>, <p>They were directed towards one person.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? What are—Huh? Eh... Ah...\"</p>, <p>He stopped mid-sentence.</p>, <p>A strange silence filled my surroundings.</p>, <p>One that was broken by me as I stood up from my seat. Under the eyes of all present, I walked up the aisles before stopping in front of him.</p>, <p>His focus wasn't on me.</p>, <p>\"T-this... Wha-t is this...?\"</p>, <p>Flustered, he touched his cheeks.</p>, <p>They were stained with tears.</p>, <p>Gripping his shirt, he looked up at me.</p>, <p>\"W-what's going on? What did you do?\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer.</p>, <p>Instead, I asked,</p>, <p>\"Did I touch you?\"</p>, <p>\"Ah... H-ah.\"</p>, <p>The tears streamed with even more force as his face paled.</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth and raised my head. Recollections of the scene I witnessed replayed in my mind, threatening to force tears out of my eyes.</p>, <p>But I held them in.</p>, <p>I let the pain center towards my chest, where it had all accumulated.</p>, <p>Instead, I directed my attention towards Anders.</p>, <p>I opened my arms.</p>, <p>\"....You say I'm weak.\"</p>, <p>Unfitting of my rank.</p>, <p>\"Here's your chance. Hit me. \"</p>, <p>\"Uekh... I...\"</p>, <p>With his hand on his chest, he only looked at me.</p>, <p>I looked back at him.</p>, <p>\"So you can't...?\"</p>, <p>I reached my hand forward to grasp his shoulder. He flinched at the touch but wasn't able to free himself from it.</p>, <p>\"Tell me.\"</p>, <p>He seemed to be in too much pain to answer.</p>, <p>I could relate.</p>, <p>My body was being eaten from the inside. The pain was unbearable, and every second I stood felt like torture.</p>, <p>But I still held myself.</p>, <p>I couldn't show weakness.</p>, <p>Not yet.</p>, <p>I then recalled the words he threw at me before this; 'Even then, I doubt you'll be able to do anything to me.'</p>, <p>That was when I asked,</p>, <p>\"....Am I doing something now?\"</p>, <p>He didn't answer.</p>, <p>Squeezing his shoulder, I murmured,</p>, <p>\"I thought so.\"</p>]\n",

I...\"</p>, <p>They weren't my tears.</p>, <p>\"...Do you still think I'm weak?\"</p>, <p>Every word that came out of my mouth seemed to liberate me from the pain that was engulfing my chest.</p>, <p>But it wasn't enough.</p>, <p>That's why I squeezed his shoulder. It helped me alleviate the pain further while, at the same time, keeping me from falling. It was hard to remain standing.</p>, <p>\"Ukh... Ah... W-what did you do...?\"</p>, <p>Helplessness marred his features as he looked at me.</p>, <p>I clenched my teeth. My eyes felt moist. The tears were trying their best to escape my eyes.

No weak path.\"</p>, <p>I repeated the same words I said before.</p>, <p>His expression changed, and the tears continued to pour down his face. But... I could see anger interweaving with the sadness.</p>, <p>\"You, you...\"</p>, <p>His lips quivered.</p>, <p>He struggled to make eye contact with me. That didn't last for long and his jaw clenched tightly, and his expression twisted.</p>, <p>Then...</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>My face stung, and my head turned. His fist reached my cheek, pushing it to the side. Even so, even as my head turned, I didn't look away.

Towering over her, it was an imposing statue. One that every student who passed couldn't help but notice.</p>, <p>It was the statue of the first emperor.</p>, <p>Dorset Gaius Megrail.</p>, <p>Her ancestor and the first Zenith.</p>, <p>Indeed, the blood of a Zenith flowed through her. A great honor that came with heavy responsibilities.</p>, <p>It had been centuries since a Zenith had been born into their family.</p>, <p>Their efforts at nurturing a Zenith had been in vain, and despite all their policies to keep others in check, the other houses were catching up.</p>, <p>In particular...</p>, <p>'Delilah Venice Rosemberg.'</p>, <p>A name stood out in her mind. She was the closest to the Zenith and the one with the power to end their reign.</p>, <p>\"...I won't fail.\"</p>, <p>To become the Zenith.</p>, <p>Aoife was willing to do anything.</p>, <p>It was her duty as a princess and her goal.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Students flowed out of the hall, with many of them glancing in her direction as they passed by. Ignoring them, she lowered her head to stare at her hand.</p>, <p>It was trembling.</p>, <p>Slightly.</p>, <p>\"Why?\"</p>, <p>Aoife's only question was 'Why'.</p>, <p>But at heart, she knew the reason for this.</p>, <p>She shut her eyes, allowing her mind to delve deep as she rewound the events that had unfolded earlier.</p>, <p>Anders Maddison.</p>, <p>...He was one of the cadets to look out for. Ranked within the top hundreds, he was a very talented individual, and someone Aoife kept in mind.</p>, <p>He was a talented person she thought of recruiting for her faction.</p>, <p>She was especially pleased by his boldness.</p>, <p>\"Simply put, you're not fit for the role. You're weak.\"</p>, <p>His bold words back then echoed the thoughts of everyone present.</p>, <p>The weakest Black Star.</p>, <p>That was who Julien Dacre Evenus was.</p>, <p>'Weak.'</p>, <p>He was truly weak.</p>, <p>To the point where one might wonder how he had managed to get himself into the position. It was a thought that consumed Aoife's mind over the past week.</p>, <p>How could someone as weak as him become the Black Star?</p>, <p>She could recall his expression back then. Under the barrage of Anders's words, he seemed calm. Unfazed, almost.</p>, <p>It was as if he truly didn't care.</p>, <p>But was that the case...?</p>, <p>Did he truly not care?</p>, <p>At the time, when she saw him close his eyes, Aoife thought, 'He's running away.' His actions again made her ask the question,</p>, <p>'Just what is so special about him...?'</p>, <p>His attitude was trash, his mana flow was weak, and he wasn't of high noble birth.</p>, <p>\".....Why?\"</p>, <p>She was confident that if the two of them were to fight one-on-one, she'd beat him with a simple flick of her finger.</p>, <p>He was that weak in her eyes.</p>, <p>The only one whom she truly deemed strong was not Julien, but his knight.</p>, <p>Leon Rowan Ellert.</p>, <p>He was ranked second, and unlike Julien, Aoife could see that he was strong. She couldn't see herself beating him easily. If she wanted to beat him, she'd have to pull out every card she had.</p>, <p>\"....When was the last time that you cried?\"</p>, <p>Even now, she could remember his voice. The tone, the smoothness, and the fluidity of it. It wasn't something she could forget.</p>, <p>Never.</p>, <p>\"Uh...? What are—Huh? Eh... Ah...\"</p>, <p>The way Ander's face changed at his words, and tears flowed out of his eyes...</p>, <p>She could also remember.</p>, <p>The change was so abrupt that hardly anyone was able to react. Aoife was one of the few who was able to understand what had happened.</p>, <p>By the time she did, however, Julien was already standing in front of him.</p>, <p>\"Did I touch you?\"</p>, <p>He didn't.</p>, <p>His every action seemed calculated. As if he were evoking a certain flow.</p>, <p>First he evoked sadness.</p>, <p>\"...When was the last time that you cried?\"</p>, <p>Then, he evoked anger.</p>, <p>\"Here's your chance. Hit me. \"</p>, <p>\"You, you...\"</p>, <p>Bang—!</p>, <p>And then...</p>, <p>\".....Pathetic.\"</p>, <p>He evoked fear.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>Aoife opened her eyes.</p>, <p>\"The entire time, he was in complete control.\"</p>, <p>It was an unmistakable fact.</p>, <p>What made Emotive Mages so scary? It wasn't their strength. Far from it. They were weak. Even the weakest mage could kill them.</p>, <p>.....But that was only on the premise that they didn't fall for their words.</p>, <p>Through the exploitation of a single emotion, Emotive Mages could evoke and manipulate other emotions. Though different, they were all intertwined together. And the more emotions am Emotive Mage could manipulate, the stronger they were.</p>, <p>Emotions were a weakness.</p>, <p>It was something that Aoife understood all too well.</p>, <p>Aoife's fist slowly clenched.</p>, <p>\"He's weak.\"</p>, <p>That was undeniable.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\".....He's strong.\"</p>, <p>Weak but strong.</p>, <p>\"Julien.\"</p>, <p>A new name crawled its way up in her mind.</p>, <p>It stood right alongside Delilah's.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>A familiar feeling.</p>, <p>One that I had grown accustomed to.</p>, <p>My legs were weak.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Each breath felt tiring.</p>, <p>And the world felt empty.</p>, <p>Colorless.</p>, <p>It was just.... meaningless.

More specifically, toward the first spell.</p>, <p>Anger.</p>, <p>\"...!\"</p>, <p>Beginner type spell [Emotive] : Anger</p>, <p>Lvl. 1 [0%--[13%]--------------100%]</p>, <p>A small bar appeared right beneath.</p>, <p>\"...Finally.\"</p>, <p> A change occurred, and I was able to get an idea of my current progress.</p>, <p>I proceeded to tap on the other bars.</p>, <p>Sadness -- Lvl. 2 [23%]</p>, <p>Fear -- Lvl. 1 [37%]</p>, <p>Happiness -- Lvl. 1 [37%]</p>, <p>Disgust -- Lvl. 1 [37%]</p>, <p>Surprise -- Lvl. 1 [37%]</p>, <p>\"Interesting.\"</p>, <p>The only spell that was level 2 was [Sadness]. The revelation didn't come as a surprise to me. I had already been aware of it.</p>, <p>What I wasn't aware of was its progress.</p>, <p>23%...</p>, <p>That was a lot more than I thought.</p>, <p>\"....So in the end, real-life experience does count in the progress. My real-life experience. Not Julien's.\"</p>, <p>The fact that I was already level 2 and that the other emotions also had a little progress served to affirm my thoughts.</p>, <p>If that wasn't enough proof;</p>, <p>Hands of Malady -- Lvl. 1 [0%]</p>, <p>Chains of Alakantria -- Lvl. 1 [0%]</p>, <p>\"Haha...\"</p>, <p>A laugh escaped my lips.</p>, <p>How could it not?</p>, <p>0%...</p>, <p>Not even one percent. Simply zero...</p>, <p>\"I guess that proves it.\"</p>, <p>The previous Julien was capable of using such spells. Though not brilliantly, he was capable. That was what Leon told me.</p>, <p>Since it was at 0%, I was able to confirm my previous thought.</p>, <p>My current progress.</p>, <p>Be it Emotive, or Elemental.</p>, <p>They were all mine. Not the previous Julien's, but mine.</p>, <p>\"Huuu.\"</p>, <p>I took a deep breath.</p>, <p>Closing my eyes, I extended my hand forward. A small circle floated in the air in front of me and several runes started to light up.</p>, <p>\"Again.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Located a five-minute walk from the Rondeo Dorms was a training facility called the [Karlson Hall].</p>, <p>This facility, spanning 1000 square meters, housed an array of enchanting devices and exercise equipment for training purposes.</p>, <p>Typically bustling with cadets, the hall was relatively empty. With it being the start of the year, the cadets were all busy socializing with one another.</p>, <p>Socialization was important in the noble circle. It was, therefore, encouraged by the households to attend such gatherings.</p>, <p>All with the exception of a few people.</p>, <p>\"So you're here.\"</p>, <p>An exception to all of this was Leon. He was drenched from head to toe, sword in hand. In front of him stood a dummy, its body cut in two.</p>, <p>His movements came to a stop upon hearing the familiar voice behind him.</p>, <p>\"Evelyn? What brings you here?\"</p>, <p>\"...I can't train?\"</p>, <p>With a helpless shrug, she pointed toward the training dummies nearby. Seeing them, Leon made a look of understanding.</p>, <p>\"I see.\"</p>, <p>He proceeded to wipe the sweat from his forehead.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>An awkward silence followed suit.</p>, <p>Evelyn made an exasperated face when she looked at him.</p>, <p>\"I'm not going to talk about him.\"</p>, <p>\"...Yes?\"</p>, <p>\"I won't ask so you don't need to be so tense.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Was he that obvious...? For a moment, Leon struggled to answer.</p>, <p>\"I get it. You don't want to talk about him. I also don't want to talk about him. It doesn't always have to be about him.\"</p>, <p>\"...Is that so.\"</p>, <p>Leon's shoulders relaxed, and so did his expression.</p>, <p>\"How have you been?\"</p>, <p>Five years. That was how long the two hadn't seen each other.</p>, <p>The Evenus Household was one of the fastest-rising noble houses. Naturally, their circle was vast. The Verlice family was one of the families that they had gotten close to over the past years.</p>, <p>There was a time when there were talks between the houses to have Evelyn and Julien engaged.</p>, <p>That, however, fell through in the end.</p>, <p>\"Well... I've been good, I guess?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn shrugged and smiled wryly. Waving her hand, she pointed at the broken dummy.</p>, <p>\"Forget about me. I'm surprised that you managed to get the second seat. You've improved quite a lot. You could hardly hold the sword the last time I met you...\"</p>, <p>\"I've train--What's with that look?\"</p>, <p>\"So bland.\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's face scrunched up.</p>, <p>\"...I didn't take you for such a bland guy.\"</p>, <p>She then mimicked his expression, going all stony.</p>, <p>\"I've trained. Worked hard~\"</p>, <p>And flexed her muscles.</p>, <p>Staring at the scene, Leon turned his head and covered his mouth with his fist.</p>, <p>\"...Kuhum. Sorry.\"</p>, <p>\"Please, the fact that you don't even realize...\"</p>, <p>Evelyn's face changed and she stopped mid-sentence. Covering her mouth, she leaned closer.</p>, <p>\"...What?\"</p>, <p>\"What.\"</p>, <p>Leon turned his head further.</p>, <p>\"Don't tell me...\"</p>, <p>But Evely insisted.</p>, <p>\"You.\"</p>, <p>Finally catching a glimpse of his face, her eyes widened.</p>, <p>\"You're blushing, aren't you? Wait, don't tell me you don't know that's how you react?\"</p>, <p>\"I...\"</p>, <p>\"No way...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'Mirror dimension' -- A phenomenon that took over the continent of Aurora.</p>, <p>There wasn't much information regarding the Mirror Dimension. All that was known was that it expanded each year, slowly swallowing up the continent in the process.</p>, <p>From there, existences known as 'Children of the Dark' emerged into the continent.</p>, <p>These entities of chaos shook the very foundation of humanity, swallowing up territories at a fast pace.</p>, <p>The general situation was as such.</p>, <p>At least, that was how I understood things.</p>, <p>\"Although the situation sounds dire, the Empire is still holding up well. In fact, we've managed to regain some of our territories as of late. Which is why you need to memorize the monsters that are on the list. It'll be useful for you for when you enter the Mirror Dimension.\"</p>, <p>The class I was attending was called 'Heritage Recollection and Monster Analysis.' There were a lot of things to remember, from the history, monster types, classifications, and so on...</p>, <p>Looking at the long list of things that I needed to memorize I felt my head hurt a little.</p>, <p>It reminded me of the times back when I was in school.</p>, <p>That said, it didn't seem like I was the only one struggling.</p>, <p>Staring at the white-haired figure sitting a few rows ahead of me, I held myself back from laughing.</p>, <p>With a \"Unnng\" she ruffled her hair, muttering things like, 'I'm fucked. Should I just sell myself? Fuck, no. Shit...'</p>, <p>Just a lot of nonsense.</p>, <p>At that moment, as if she could sense my gaze, her head turned and our eyes met. My expression stiffened at the sight of her, and an image flashed in my mind.</p>, <p>'...It's her.'</p>, <p>One of the girls from the vision.</p>, <p>Before I could process the information, she tilted her head and mouthed, 'What are you looking at?'</p>, <p>I thought about answering but decided against it when I felt the professor's gaze pause on me.</p>, <p>Clicking her tongue, she returned her attention to the front.</p>, <p>The lecture continued from there.</p>, <p>It only ended when another hour passed. By then, I was mentally drained.</p>, <p>\"We've only covered a portion of the syllabus. We've still got a lot of things to go through. Please go back home and digest the information.\"</p>, <p>As if he wasn't satisfied, the lecturer added.</p>, <p>\"I'll review what you've learned in the next lecture.\"</p>, <p>A pained groan followed his exit as the white-haired girl gripped her head.</p>, <p>\"I'm fucked... I'm done. Shit. At this rate, I'll fail... Do I have no choice but to sell myself?\"</p>, <p>She looked around before settling her gaze toward the nearest boy.</p>, <p>\"Oy.\"</p>, <p>\"...Hm?\"</p>, <p>\"How much would you pay for me?\"</p>, <p>\"Eh?\"</p>, <p>Flustered, the boy took a step back. She didn't seem to mind and approached him. Her every action attracted the gaze of those around her. She was that pretty.</p>, <p>Too bad she was crazy.</p>, <p>Bat shit crazy.</p>, <p>\"How about this...\"</p>, <p>She leaned her elbow on his shoulder. Learning her head closer, she scratched her chin and nodded. As if she had just made a big decision.</p>, <p>\"You give me all your money, and in exchange, I'll let you hold my hand. How about it?\"</p>, <p>\"....Eh?\"</p>, <p>\"Is that a no?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"Tsk.\"</p>, <p>She clicked her tongue and proceeded to her next target. It went on like this for a while before she left with a gloomy look.</p>, <p>I thought about leaving, but the scene was rather entertaining. I wanted to know if anyone was willing to pay all their money just to hold her hand.</p>, <p>That, and...</p>, <p>The fact that I dreaded the next class.</p>, <p>[Dimension Diving]</p>, <p>As the name suggested, it was a class designated to emulate the environment of the 'Mirror Dimension'. While it wasn't the real deal, and the monsters were fake, it didn't mean that it was impossible to get injured.</p>, <p>Quite frankly.</p>, <p>I didn't want to go.</p>, <p>My skills were not up to par.</p>, <p>The only thing I could do was stay behind and watch.</p>, <p>\"Please gear yourself and put on your suits. We'll be starting in the next half hour.\"</p>, <p>A loud voice reminded me of the impending doom. Sighing to myself, I turned to look at Leon who had remained quiet the entire time. Turning his head to look at me, he raised his fist as if to say, 'Cheer up' before packing up his staff and heading for the door.</p>, <p>\"Hey, wait. Why are you leaving?\"</p>, <p>\"...Yes?\"</p>, <p>Leon stopped to look at me.</p>, <p>\"Aren't you supposed to be my knight?\"</p>, <p>Wasn't his entire job to protect me?</p>, <p>\"Oh.\"</p>, <p>He nodded.</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>\"So...\"</p>, <p>\"...Are you going to file a complaint?\"</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>\"Then...\"</p>, <p>He nodded his head and excused himself.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>I held my hand over my forehead.</p>, <p>Fuck.</p>, <p>I really didn't want to go.</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was as if the air itself had cracked. Fragments, like that of a fractured mirror, lingered suspended in midair.</p>, <p>A small crowd formed outside of the shattered space. There were over several hundred students, all of them huddled together in their cliques.</p>, <p>The same couldn't be said for me.</p>, <p>Be it because they were avoiding me, or just didn't like me, nobody appeared anywhere around me.</p>, <p>.....I was the only one who was alone.</p>, <p>\"Mirror Dimension...\"</p>, <p>Not that I minded since my attention was on the cracked space in front of me.</p>, <p>'Yeah, I really don't want to go.'</p>, <p>Everything about it felt ominous.</p>, <p>Still, it wasn't like I had a choice. Whether I liked it or not, I had to go. Perhaps I'll be able to find answers here...</p>, <p>While I was in the midst of my thoughts, the instructor, Amir Wallow, showed up.</p>, <p>The surroundings went quiet.</p>, <p>\"Since everyone is gathered here, I'll make things short. We will now be diving in groups of five. I'll announce the list shortly.\"</p>, <p>The noise that had previously taken hold of the space increased as the cadets grew restless.</p>, <p>'So we're doing this in teams.'</p>, <p>\"It'll be random so the balance won't be right. However, that shouldn't matter since you aren't being graded for this. It's all about getting used to the environment for when you end up entering the more dangerous parts of the mirror dimension.\"</p>, <p>He then proceeded to give a rundown of the team's compositions. A team generally was composed of four to five members -- two damage-dealers, one long-range, one tank, and one support.</p>, <p>It generally alternated between one and two damage dealers per team.</p>, <p>In that sense, I was assigned the support role.</p>, <p>\"It is up to you to decide the team leader. Be it the strongest person, or who you feel will be able to lead better... It's up to you.\"</p>, <p>The teams were announced shortly after.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>Team Seven</p>, <p>: 1. Julien Evenus</p>, <p>: 2. Rosanne Brighton</p>, <p>: 3. Aoife Megrail</p>, <p>: 4. James Milner</p>, <p>: 5. Adan Whitelock</p>, <p>\"...Team Seven.\"</p>, <p>A lot of unfamiliar names appeared on the list. There were over a thousand first years, and it was hard for me to remember everyone's name.</p>, <p>However, there was one name that stood out from the rest.</p>, <p>Aoife Megrail.</p>, <p>The Megrail name stood out immediately. It was the name of the ruling house and one of the women that appeared in my vision.</p>, <p> Taking my eyes away from the board, I met her gaze. Her expression was hard to read, and briefly, I felt a certain coldness flash in her eyes. That went by really fast.</p>, <p>She was the first one to approach me. Her red hair gracefully swung in the air as her beautiful lips parted open.</p>, <p>\"We're on the same team.\"</p>, <p>\"...So it seems.\"</p>, <p>My tone came out rather stiff. I wasn't quite sure how to address her. With her being a princess, I had to be careful with my words.</p>, <p>That was until she spoke again.</p>, <p>\"You're weak.\"</p>, <p>She spoke in a manner that left no room for debate.</p>, <p>\"...That's why I will be the team leader.\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer and just stared at her. She looked back at me. Straight in the eyes. It was as if she was challenging me.</p>, <p>Wanted me to refuse her.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>\"Do as you see fit.\"</p>, <p>All she did was do me a favor.</p>, <p>I didn't want to be the leader. I wasn't fit to be one as well.</p>, <p>As her composed expression began to reveal cracks under the impact of my actions, a smile tugged at my lips while I lowered my head.</p>, <p>\".....Team Leader.\"</p>, <p>*</p>, <p>The air was dry.</p>, <p>The world appeared monochromatic, enveloped in shades of gray, with the sole exception of the vivid red and orange tones emanating from the sun in the sky.</p>, <p>I was running through a rocky field.</p>, <p>The other team members were running ahead of me. Unlike me, they didn't seem to be struggling.</p>, <p>My stamina was starting to run low.</p>, <p>Was this the difference between us...?</p>, <p>\"Let's stop here.\"</p>, <p>Thankfully, we stopped just as I couldn't hold my composure. Halting, Aoife looked around before settling her gaze over a large rock.</p>, <p>\"Let's take a small break for now. We're almost near our destination.\"</p>, <p>Taking advantage of the situation, I sat on the rock to catch my breath. There were a total of five people in the group, and as I sat down, none of the members approached me and huddled over to Aoife.</p>, <p>'Can't blame them... She's a princess.'</p>, <p>Had I been in their position, I too would've been like them.</p>, <p>It was unfortunate that in the future, there was a chance she'd kill me. I needed to be careful around her.</p>, <p>An appropriate distance was required.</p>, <p>Still, from where I was, I could overhear their conversation.</p>, <p>\"Team Leader, where exactly are we going?\"</p>, <p>\"...Gathering point. We should be able to meet with the other members there.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, is that so.\"</p>, <p>A woman with gold locks sighed in relief. Rosanne Brighton. With a long staff in hand, she was the long-ranged fighter of the team.</p>, <p>An elemental user with dual attributes.</p>, <p>Fire, and water.</p>, <p>She looked around.</p>, <p>\"Things have been proceeding rather smoothly. We still haven't seen many monsters yet. Is it because this is one of the safer areas?\"</p>, <p>\"The point of this excursion is for us to familiarize ourselves with the environment. There shouldn't be that many monsters.\"</p>, <p>Standing at an imposing height of 2 meters, he towered over all of us. James Milner, the team's tanker, replied.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>\"That's right.\"</p>, <p>Chewing on a jerky, Aoife glanced around.</p>, <p>\".....Still, keep your guard up. Always stay alert. Don't let your guard down.\"</p>, <p>\"Got it.\"</p>, <p>Nodding, Aoife finished the jerky and patted her hands.</p>, <p>\"Let's go.\"</p>, <p>We were back on the move.</p>, <p>The terrain shifted, and trees emerged in my field of vision, their leafless branches stretching out and gradually surrounding us as we advanced.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>Our group was engulfed in silence, disrupted only by the steady rhythm of our footsteps resonating against the uneven ground blanketed with a layer of damp, decomposing leaves.</p>, <p>Gradually, the light dimmed, and I sensed myself losing my sight. Wisps of fog clung to the gnarled trunks of the trees around us, making it hard for me to see.</p>, <p>\"....Continue.\"</p>, <p>A sense of dread assaulted my mind as we marched forward.</p>, <p>From eyesight to hearing... We were gradually losing sight of all our senses.</p>, <p>\"Haaa... Haaa....\"</p>, <p>My breath started to feel heavy.</p>, <p>...Was it because I was growing tired?</p>, <p>A thought that accompanied my mind as I continued forward.</p>, <p>\"Ukh...!\"</p>, <p>My head throbbed all of a sudden.</p>, <p>The pain wasn't intense. It came as fast as it left. By the time I regained my senses, the light started to return.</p>, <p>'What was that...?'</p>, <p>Checking myself, I felt nothing strange with my body. Staring at my hands, I frowned but continued forward.</p>, <p>My mind eventually relaxed after a couple of minutes.</p>, <p>\"....I'm probably tired.\"</p>, <p>Just as I felt my chest grow lighter.....</p>, <p>SHIIIING--!</p>, <p>Something streaked through the air, coming at me from a nearby tree. It was so fast that I had no time to react.</p>, <p>Before I even had the chance to gather my bearings, an intense pain flooded my chest.</p>, <p>Thump.</p>, <p>And I fell to my knees.</p>, <p>\"Pftt.\"</p>, <p>Blood spilled from my mouth as I felt my head grow light.</p>, <p>The world became a blur from there.</p>, <p>\"W-what...\"</p>, <p>I could hardly speak and the words refused to leave my mouth.</p>, <p>The pain was hard to describe.</p>, <p>It was intense, and my consciousness grew faint.</p>, <p>Clank--!</p>, <p>The last thing I managed to see before I lost consciousness was a small creature diving from the front, right toward Aoife who just barely managed to react.</p>, <p>\"Sh-it...\"</p>, <p>And then the world grew dark.</p>, <p>Or so I thought.</p>, <p>\"Uahp...!\"</p>, <p>As if oxygen had been removed from my lungs, I took a deep breath. My consciousness returned and clarity returned.</p>, <p>Scrunch... Scrunch...</p>, <p>The familiar sound of my footsteps echoed through the ground, and as I looked ahead, familiar backs came into view.</p>, <p>'What just...'</p>, <p>The memory of the situation was still vivid in my mind. Although my vision was hindered, the path was familiar.</p>, <p>From the trees to our current location. It was all the same. Just in a couple of minutes, we should be coming out...</p>, <p>Indeed, as I thought, lights started to return. A familiar view.</p>, <p>Gradually, my feet started to slow down.</p>, <p>Noticing my situation, the others stopped as well. With a frown, Aoife looked at me.</p>, <p>\"Are you tired?\"</p>, <p>I didn't answer her.</p>, <p>Scanning my surroundings, everything appeared to be the same as before. So much that it felt eery.</p>, <p>\"...Julien?\"</p>, <p>The positions of the trees, the placement of the rocks, and the sensation of the air--every detail rushed vividly back to my memory.</p>, <p>It can't be, right...?</p>, <p>\"Hey...!\"</p>, <p>I snapped out of it when two large hands grasped my shoulders. A rough face inched close to mine.</p>, <p>\"Someone is talking to you, pay attention.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>That was when I realized everyone was looking at me. Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath before opening my eyes again.</p>, <p>\"Let go.\"</p>, <p>\"You.\"</p>, <p>Raising my hand, I was just about to grasp his shoulder when he let go and cursed.</p>, <p>\".....Arrogant bastard.\"</p>, <p>Ignoring him, I patted and adjusted my clothes. Feeling Aoife's intense gaze, I felt compelled to say something.</p>, <p>\"There's an ambush ahead.\"</p>, <p>Maybe.</p>, <p>I wasn't too sure.</p>, <p>\"An ambush...?\"</p>, <p>Making a dumbfounded look, James's mouth dropped.</p>, <p>\"Is that really the best excuse you cou--\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>Ignoring him, I took a step forward.</p>, <p>\"Hey, you...!\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>And then another. Carefully counting each step, I closed my eyes and replayed the memory in my mind. Gradually, I arrived near the exact spot where the memory ended.</p>, <p>I was just one step away.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>My feet stopped.</p>, <p>Just one step.

But unlike last time, I was prepared. Tilting my body ever so slightly, it passed right before me.</p>, <p>With a 'thud,' it came crashing toward the ground, revealing a glimpse of its features.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I didn't pay much attention to it's looks.

The vision grabbed my thoughts as it replayed in my mind.</p>, <p>Every detail, from the minutiae to the grand, was etched vividly in my memory.</p>, <p>With a thought, I could recall everything that had happened. From the pain to the very last moments when something dashed at the team leader.</p>, <p>The memories were vivid in my mind, and as my gaze settled on a specific tree, my hand instinctively reached out, extending a finger to point at it.</p>, <p>\"That one.\"</p>, <p>I was sure.</p>, <p>The memories told me so.</p>, <p>\".....Get rid of that one too.\"</p>, <p>Another one was hiding in that tree.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>'How did he know...?'</p>, <p>Aoife looked at his back, her eyes falling on the creature on the ground.</p>, <p>'Rabbleflit'</p>, <p>An 'infant' ranked beast.

The tree shriveled up, compressing like a scrunched-up paper.</p>, <p>It all happened so fast that the creature was unable to react.</p>, <p>\"Hieek...!\"</p>, <p>After a deafening screech, what followed was the creature's shriveled-up body.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Aoife took a look at the creature before turning her head away.</p>, <p>'How ugly...'</p>, <p>Just like Julien, she was talented in two fields.</p>, <p>[Mind] and [Body].</p>, <p>Unlike Julien, who was proficient in the Emotive field under the Mind classification, she was more proficient in Telekinesis.</p>, <p>With a single thought, she could manipulate an inanimate object.</p>, <p>\"Yuck, it looks nasty.\"</p>, <p>A different figure drew near, leaning forward as her golden locks cascaded over her face while she grimaced.</p>, <p>\"They really do look different than the textbooks, don't they?

She somewhat expected such an answer from him.</p>, <p>It seemed fitting.</p>, <p>Could she be starting to get an idea of his character?</p>, <p>\"Can you continue doing it?\"</p>, <p>Aoife believed that moving forward, if they wanted no accidents to occur, they needed his assistance.</p>, <p>He had proven his abilities worked.</p>, <p>Even as the other members showed clear signs of refusal, she ignored them. For this journey to go smoothly, she needed him.</p>, <p>Pride was meaningless under such circumstances.</p>, <p>She expected him to feel the same too, but as their gazes met, he shook his head.</p>, <p>\"No.\"</p>, <p>Casually taking out a jerky, he bit into it and turned away.</p>, <p>\"...Even if I want to, I can't.\"</p>, <p>Staring at his back, Aoife's expression didn't change.</p>, <p>Such response... It was fitting of him.</p>, <p>But as expected.</p>, <p>'I really can't stand him.'</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The Mirror Dimension was an expansive space devoid of any life.</p>, <p>The amount of manpower used by the kingdom to keep the space from expanding was enormous.</p>, <p>Thankfully, just as threatening as the Mirror Dimension was, it was also a land filled with opportunities.</p>, <p>Black Region Supply-Station.</p>, <p>In front of a levitating panel adorned with a myriad of shifting images stood a gracefully poised woman with flowing black hair.</p>, <p>Delilah's gaze seemed fixed on a certain panel.</p>, <p>\".....Could it be that he's very perceptive to mana?\"</p>, <p>[Get rid of that one too.]</p>, <p>The way he was able to detect Rabbleflit so effortlessly despite not specializing in such magic. The way he was able to avoid its ambush...</p>, <p>It aroused curiosity.</p>, <p>When one thought about it, what he did wasn't all that impressive. Recognizing the mana flow of a creature was something that most mages were capable of doing after reaching a certain point.</p>, <p>The key point, however, was 'certain point'.</p>, <p>Tier 3 and above was the requirement.</p>, <p>In other words, he was able to achieve something like that before even reaching Tier 3.</p>, <p>\"Fascinating.\"</p>, <p>Truly.</p>, <p>But that was all.</p>, <p>It was just fascinating.</p>, <p>Her lingering interest in him waned when she brought her attention to a specific paper.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>It was a document detailing Julien's background.</p>, <p>The contents weren't very thick. However, a certain page caught her attention. It was a close-up image of him.</p>, <p>Her eyes slowly traced down toward his forearm, where a small black tattoo appeared.</p>, <p>It was an unremarkable tattoo. One that any other person could have.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>She was confident.</p>, <p>After doing an intensive background check, she was sure of it.</p>, <p>\"....So you've finally shown yourselves.\"</p>, <p>Delilah gently closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The paper in her hand wrinkled under her grasp.</p>, <p>\"To think you'd even try to target this place...\"</p>, <p>Finally, cracks appeared on her usually composed expression as her lips twisted up. A sneer marred her features.</p>, <p>\"How bold.\"</p>, <p>She spat out, trying her best to suppress the raging storm that was boiling in her chest.</p>, <p>Staring at the tattoo in the picture, her expression turned frosty.</p>, <p>\"How very bold...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>\"Looks like all the teams have gathered.\"</p>, <p>There were no other hiccups on our journey to the designated spot. That was good because I still struggled to clear my mind of the vision.</p>, <p>I still felt the lingering after-effects of my death. Thankfully, it happened fast... but the very last moments were still deeply rooted in my mind.</p>, <p>\"What you guys currently experienced was merely a taste of the dimension. The deeper you venture, the harder things will become. Thankfully, our empire set up several safe stations located throughout. This one being one of them.\"</p>, <p>Amir Wallow gave a long-winded statement. He gave us a short overview of our current location.</p>, <p>Looking around, I had to hold myself from expressing my surprise.</p>, <p>High walls constructed from sturdy rock enclosed the area, while tents were scattered throughout. In the distance, a fissured space marked the entrance and exit points where people came and went.</p>, <p>It was a strange sight. One that I didn't think I would get used to easily.</p>, <p>\"This is a rather small safe-station. There's plenty deeper within the dimension, but you won't get to experience those just yet. For now, enjoy yourselves here. We will return to the institute in an hour.\"</p>, <p>The cadets all separated.</p>, <p>Perhaps because everything seemed so new, everyone looked strangely excited as they scattered to check out the safe zone.</p>, <p>I thought about checking the place, too, but...</p>, <p>\"I'm tired.\"</p>, <p>I felt strangely tired.</p>, <p>My eyelids were growing heavier, and each step felt heavier than the last. It was to the point where I had no choice but to find a place to sit.</p>, <p>\"Haa...\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I covered my face.</p>, <p>What sort of situation was this?</p>, <p>It wasn't as though I did much coming here. My group members did most of the killings while I watched from behind.</p>, <p>The only time I acted was when...</p>, <p>\"Could it be that?\"</p>, <p>Was this the consequence of the 'insight' ability?</p>, <p>If that was the case, I was more than happy with it. Compared to the backlash from 'immersion,' this felt like nothing.</p>, <p>\"Haha.... shit, have I become too used to this?\"</p>, <p>Physical pain, tiredness, mental trauma... It felt like I had experienced a lot of things over the past week.</p>, <p>\"This is crazy.

Focusing my attention on it, my eyes fell on the four-leaved clover.</p>, <p>Two of the leaves were currently lit.</p>, <p>The top and bottom.</p>, <p>\"...How strange.\"</p>, <p>It was a mysterious tattoo. It had been with me ever since I appeared in this world.

Four abilities?\"</p>, <p>It seemed logical.</p>, <p>I had already experienced one.</p>, <p>My mind shuddered thinking about the first ability.

First years weren't allowed to select their own courses. Therefore, as I glanced at the name of the lecture, I had to resist the urge to audibly groan.</p>, <p>\".....Language study.\"</p>, <p>As expected.</p>, <p>Even in this world, these types of lectures were unavoidable.</p>, <p>The language that was used in this empire was called 'Lumoraic'. A modern language that was only a few centuries old.</p>, <p>It was good that when I came to this world I was already able to speak, or else...</p>, <p>\"Let's not think about it.\"</p>, <p>I silently entered the classroom.</p>, <p>The classroom was rather large. With over a hundred students, it had to be spacious.</p>, <p>The moment I entered the classroom, several gazes fell on me. Their gazes still felt burdensome, but I was slowly starting to get used to them.</p>, <p>I looked around before eventually making my way toward where Leon was.</p>, <p>It was strange.</p>, <p>Before, he'd used to follow me everywhere. As if he was studying my every move.</p>, <p>However, now... He didn't seem to care as much.</p>, <p>Still, he did save me a seat.</p>, <p>So that's that.</p>, <p>I had just taken a seat when Leon glanced at me and frowned.</p>, <p>\".....You look quite tired.\"</p>, <p>\"Ah, yeah.\"</p>, <p>I hardly slept last night.</p>, <p>\"I'm still adjusting.\"</p>, <p>\"Oh. Take care of yourself.\"</p>, <p>\"...Yeah.\"</p>, <p>The conversation ended there. He was a man of little words, and so was I. Our conversations usually lasted for this long.</p>, <p>To an outsider, they probably sounded like an extremely stiff conversation. However, I liked it to be like this.</p>, <p>It was the perfect distance.</p>, <p>Not too close and not too far.</p>, <p>It was exactly 8 o'clock when the professor in charge came in.</p>, <p>\"Looks like the class is packed. It's nice to see so many students eager to learn a new language.\"</p>, <p>The professor was a middle-aged man adorned with a meticulously groomed mustache and gray hair. Clad in elegant attire, his demeanor exuded an unmistakable aura of grace.</p>, <p>It was obvious at a glance that he was a high-end noble.</p>, <p>\"As many of you know, the mirror dimensions hold many mysteries. From resources to ancient scripts... There are a lot of hidden treasures within the dimension.\"</p>, <p>There was a reason why the Empire had many supply stations constructed within the Dimension.</p>, <p>It wasn't just for the sake of stopping the expansion of the dimension. It was also for the sake of gathering resources. From the ruins of old civilizations to ores, and monsters... It held a lot of opportunity.</p>, <p>\"As one says. Knowledge is power. Within the ancient civilizations, there are many books detailing a lot of useful information regarding the expansion of the Mirror Dimension. By studying their language, we're empowering ourselves with the ability to understand their mistakes and technology.\"</p>, <p>The professor seemed enthusiastic about the lecture.</p>, <p>He went on to brag about the Empire's achievement in this field and how they were ahead of the other Empires.</p>, <p>But...</p>, <p>I couldn't feel the same excitement he felt.</p>, <p>\"....Huam.\"</p>, <p>A light yawn escaped my mouth.</p>, <p>It was a quiet one.</p>, <p>To the extent that no one else seemed to notice.</p>, <p>But it perfectly reflected my state of mind.</p>, <p>I was tired, and the lecture was boring.</p>, <p>Having barely slept the previous night, coupled with how interesting the lecture was, I found myself succumbing to drowsiness.</p>, <p>I had to pinch myself several times to keep myself from falling asleep.</p>, <p>But there was a slight problem.</p>, <p>While I did try my best to hide my drowsiness, it wasn't enough.</p>, <p>--Cadet Julien, is my lecture boring you?</p>, <p>A shadow cast over the area I was in.</p>, <p>Looking up, the professor was standing a few meters away from me.</p>, <p>\"...?\"</p>, <p>I scratched the side of my head.</p>, <p>--Did you manage to sleep last night?</p>, <p>I thought about an appropriate answer but,</p>, <p>--No.</p>, <p>I shook my head and came clean.</p>, <p>--I wasn't able to sleep much last night.</p>, <p>The professor's expression stiffened all of a sudden.</p>, <p>A small commotion followed suit as multiple eyes fell on me.</p>, <p>The situation took me aback.</p>, <p>'What's going on...?'</p>, <p>And then, I heard a small voice behind me.</p>, <p>\".....Was it just me or did his pronunciation sound even better than the professor's?\"</p>, <p>Pronunciation...?</p>, <p>I thought back on the conversation I had with the professor.</p>, <p>All he did was ask whether his lecture was boring me.</p>, <p>What was so strange ab-</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>That's when I realized.</p>, <p>'This...'</p>, <p>We were both speaking English.</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The language class ended after one hour.</p>, <p>Evelyn walked with her head lowered, accompanied by a young woman with short brown hair.</p>, <p>\"Ah~ My back hurts. I can't believe we had to go through that.\"</p>, <p>Theoretical classes always tended to be more boring than practical ones.</p>, <p>\"And the fact that we have to memorize the alphabet before the next class is even worse. Kill me already...!\"</p>, <p>As Josephine grumbled, she suddenly recalled something and tilted her head.</p>, <p>\"Evelyn, didn't you say you were acquainted with Julien?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, ah?\"</p>, <p>Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts at the mention of Julien's name.</p>, <p>\"Did you say something?\"</p>, <p>\"Geez~ Pay attention when I'm talking.\"</p>, <p>Rubbing her forehead, Josephin repeated,</p>, <p>\"Didn't you say you were acquainted with Julien?\"</p>, <p>\"...Ah, yes.\"</p>, <p>Julien. An image of a man appeared in her mind.</p>, <p>It stuck there and refused to leave.</p>, <p>\"Was he always like that? I mean, not only is he the Black Star, but he also seems to be very proficient in English. Shee~\"</p>, <p>Josephine rubbed the sides of her arms.</p>, <p>\"Did you notice the professor's expression when he was talking to him? For a moment, I found myself questioning who the real expert was. Did you not feel the same way?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Evelyn remained silent at the question. She had been quietly biting her lips for a while now.</p>, <p>Josephine tilted her head in confusion.</p>, <p>Why is she so quiet?</p>, <p>She usually wasn't this quiet.</p>, <p>\"What's wrong? Did you not feel the same?\"</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>But yet again Evelyn remained quiet.</p>, <p>Realizing that something was off, Josephine followed Evelyn's line of sight.</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>That was when she saw a figure in the distance.</p>, <p>He stood erect, his presence distinct from the others, and his strides measured and steady. His presence alone gathered the stares of those around him.</p>, <p>Staring at him from the distance, Evelyn's eyes narrowed.</p>, <p>Julien. What happened in the five years she hadn't seen him?</p>, <p>Gradually, the distance between the two of them shrank.</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>With one more step, he appeared in front of her.</p>, <p>As he passed, their gazes met briefly.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>She thought he'd continue forward, but...</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>His feet came to a stop just as he passed. Evelyn felt her shoulders grow tense at the fact. Turning around to face him, her eyes met with his.</p>, <p>They were cold.</p>, <p>Detached of any feelings. If before she could feel the emotions in his gaze, now... all she could feel was emptiness.</p>, <p>Alienation.</p>, <p>His words soon broke her thoughts.</p>, <p>\"Your lips.\"</p>, <p>He pointed.</p>, <p>\".....They're bleeding.\"</p>]\n",

With the world being grim and the student reality harsh, clubs were set up as a way to ease the mental burden on students.</p>, <p>\"Swimming... Football... Exercise Club... Cooking...\"</p>, <p>There were a lot of clubs to choose from. From physical ones to nonphysical ones. The choices seemed endless.</p>, <p>\"Comedy club...?\"</p>, <p>My eyes lingered on 'Comedy Club' for a few seconds too long. Enough to warrant Leon's attention as he turned to glance my way.</p>, <p>In order to remain consistent with the previous Julien, I had him help me select a course. It was a necessary step I needed to take to ensure my safety.</p>, <p>\"Are you considering it? To understand emotions better?\"</p>, <p>\"Uh, yeah...\"</p>, <p>That was part of the reason, sure. But there was another reason why the club interested me. I kept thinking back at the joke I said a week ago. The Cheetah, one.</p>, <p>It had bugged me for quite a while now.</p>, <p>But was the joke bad?</p>, <p>'....I don't think it was that bad.'</p>, <p>Or maybe there was a problem elsewhere?

You need to keep in mind that--\"</p>, <p>\"I think it was my delivery.\"</p>, <p>Yeah, it had to be that.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Leon's body stiffened on the spot.</p>, <p>'Ah, shit.'</p>, <p>I raised my head to look at him. He looked at me with widened eyes and an expression that seemed to say 'Has he lost it...?'</p>, <p>I felt a little offended by his gaze.</p>, <p>\"What?\"</p>, <p>Why was he looking at me like that...?</p>, <p>He opened his mouth but closed it shortly after. He then turned around to face the opposite direction.</p>, <p>\"What are you--\"</p>, <p>\"Kht.\"</p>, <p>Kht...?</p>, <p>I stopped whatever I was doing and leaned my head to get a better look at him.</p>, <p>Why is he...</p>, <p>\"Ah.\"</p>, <p>An idea suddenly struck my mind.</p>, <p>I took a good long minute to think before finally saying,</p>, <p>\"What do you call a fish with no eyes?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>Leon's eyes widened. For a moment, I thought I saw 'fear' flash in his eyes as his body flinched.</p>, <p>I continued,</p>, <p>\"Fsh.\"</p>, <p>\"Uhk...!\"</p>, <p>His body flinched.</p>, <p>And I continued,</p>, <p>\"What did the farmer who lost his rake say?\"</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>\"Where is my rake?\"</p>, <p>\"....!\"</p>, <p>Step--</p>, <p>Without looking back, Leon moved forward. The entire time, his shoulders were trembling. Staring at him, I felt the need to continue and raised my voice.</p>, <p>\"What do you call a fly with no wings?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>\"A walk.\"</p>, <p>\"....Kehut!\"</p>, <p>Holding his mouth, Leon sprinted forward.</p>, <p>I chased after him.</p>, <p>\"What did the cow...\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>Krrr...</p>, <p>The form expanded, gradually unveiling its massive, decaying jaws and spiky back. A potent surge of mana swept the surroundings as the figure increased in size.</p>, <p>\"Keep it quiet. We're not too far off from the institute.\"</p>, <p>Delilah stood not far from the creature. Her gaze lingered over the creature who stared at her with deep apprehension.</p>, <p>It growled at her before speaking.</p>, <p>\"...You think you can stop us? Your struggles are futile. Our preparations are almost done.\"</p>, <p>\"Hah.\"</p>, <p>Delilah's expression changed. With a laugh, she looked at the creature mockingly.</p>, <p>\"You bastards are always the same. How many of your 'attacks' and 'preparations' have we thwarted over the years? Have you yet to learn your lesson?\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>The beast growled.</p>, <p>\"You don--\"</p>, <p>Delilah's voice, layered by two other similar ones, cut through the creature.</p>, <p>\"You can't hide it from me.\"</p>, <p>The creature shuddered.</p>, <p>\"Hide...?\"</p>, <p>\"Your fear. I can see it from miles away.\"</p>, <p>Crunch...</p>, <p>The beast unknowingly took a step back as its body shuddered. An unknown emotion welled up from deep within its body, threatening to consume him.</p>, <p>\"Y-you....!\"</p>, <p>A red glow enveloped the beast's eyes. It understood then that its emotions were being played with.</p>, <p>But it was already too late.</p>, <p>In the moment the beast stepped back, its defeat was already set in stone.</p>, <p>Delilah's expression returned to its usually indifferent one as she raised her hand.</p>, <p>\"Krrrrr--!\"</p>, <p>The beast screamed, but it was futile.</p>, <p>Within moments of her raising her hand, the space around the beast compressed, and the echoing sound of bones cracking filled the air.</p>, <p>Thud.</p>, <p>Just like that, a 'Terror' ranked beast had died.</p>, <p>Udududuk--!</p>, <p>But something strange happened the moment the beast died. Black foam escaped its lips and its figure shrank to reveal the silhouette of a figure.</p>, <p>...A human.</p>, <p>Crunch... Crunch...</p>, <p>Delilah halted a few meters away from the body, her eyes coldly tracing it. Eventually, she bent down and turned its arm over.</p>, <p>\"....\"</p>, <p>A four-leaved clover appeared in her vision.</p>, <p>\"....As expected.\"</p>, <p>She let go of the arm, and ambers floated in the sky as the body gradually disappeared from view.</p>, <p>Crackle...!</p>, <p>Her cold eyes remained fixed on the disappearing body.</p>, <p>Gradually, her mouth parted open to mutter,</p>, <p>\"Inverted Sky.\"</p>, <p>A figure appeared in her mind.</p>, <p>One that she wholeheartedly preached to be the Black Star.</p>, <p>A crack yet again formed on her expressionless face.</p>, <p>\"....I hope I'm wrong.\"</p>]\n",

            "[<p>It was Friday.</p>, <p>The last day of the week.</p>, <p>Just like that, the first week at the institute was almost over. Today marked the second week of my transmigration.</p>, <p>Time seemed to have flown by during those two weeks. I could still vividly recall everything that had happened on the first day as if it were yesterday.</p>, <p>Quite frankly, I was tired.</p>, <p>Both physically and mentally.</p>, <p>But... I was slowly starting to adjust to this world. Slowly but surely, I was getting there.</p>, <p>I just needed a little bit more time.</p>, <p>\"Here you go.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>I glanced at the letter that sat on my desk, and I looked up. It was the last lesson of the day, and I was just about to pack up when he suddenly showed up out of nowhere.</p>, <p>\"....What is this?\"</p>, <p>\"An invitation.\"</p>, <p>Leon answered flatly. I thought about having him elaborate but chose otherwise and just opened the letter.</p>, <p>I was bound to find out anyway.</p>, <p>To : Julien of the Evenus Barony.</p>, <p>We extend our warmest greetings to your esteemed self and cordially invite you to join our exchange.</p>, <p>Your presence is certain to elevate the grandeur of the occasion, and we eagerly anticipate the pleasure of your company alongside fellow dignitaries and distinguished guests. The event promises an evening of refined conversation, exquisite cuisine, and cultural enrichment.\"</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>.</p>, <p>I skimmed through the contents of the letter.</p>, <p>\"So, in short... A party?\"</p>, <p>\"Sort of.\"</p>, <p>Sort of...?</p>, <p>\"...And I have to attend?\"</p>, <p>I rubbed my forehead.</p>, <p>I was already starting to feel a headache.</p>, <p>\"Yes.\"</p>, <p>Leon nodded and added,</p>, <p>\"Everyone does.\"</p>, <p>\"...Ah.\"</p>, <p>Fuck.</p>, <p>Leon looked around before lowering his tone.</p>, <p> \"It's best if you attend the ceremony. Create some connections. It will help you out in the long term.\"</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Remaining quiet, I sorted through my thoughts.</p>, <p>Indeed, he had a point. Connections were certainly important in this society. Not only to establish myself better as 'Julien', but for the future when the time came for me to leave this place.</p>, <p>It would certainly make my life easier.</p>, <p>With such thoughts, I looked up at Leon and slid the letter over.</p>, <p>\".....Fine.\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>The Haven campus was large.</p>, <p>Spanning over a large land, it boasted seven main halls—Leoni Hall, Rondeo Hall, Dorset Hall, Birming Hall, Milnton Hall, Karlson Hall, and Rottingham Hall.</p>, <p>Each Hall had its own distinct function.</p>, <p>The Rondeo Hall was where the dorms were located. The Leoni Hall was where the auditorium was located, the Rottingham was where the professors were situated, and so on…</p>, <p>Each hall served a distinct function, simplifying navigation for newcomers to the academy.</p>, <p>Rottingham Hall.</p>, <p>Tak— Tak!</p>, <p>The hall echoed with the soft click of her heels.</p>, <p>Delilah walked forward without as much as a single change in her expression.</p>, <p>\"Good afternoon, Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>\"It's nice to see you Chancellor.\"</p>, <p>Along the way, she'd get greeted by the staff that passed her. Glancing at them, she'd return them a nod.</p>, <p>This proceeded until she arrived at her office.</p>, <p>Creaaaak...</p>, <p>As the door opened, her feet came to a pause.</p>, <p>\".....\"</p>, <p>Her brows twitched at the sight that greeted her. Scratching the side of her head, she nimbly walked past the rows of documents that were scattered all over the floor before reaching her desk, where she sat down.</p>, <p>Gradually, her gaze fell on several fresh documents that sat by her desk.</p>, <p>They said;</p>, <p>[Extra-curricular Activities First Year Cadet selection]</p>, <p>'Oh, there was that.'</p>, <p>It was her job to review their applications.</p>, <p>Flip—</p>, <p>Casually flipping through the pages, she stamped on several of the applicant's submissions.</p>, <p>Tak. Tak—</p>, <p>Her stamp raised and fell continuously.</p>, <p>Until...</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>her eyes fell on a certain application. It was none other than Julien's.</p>, <p>\"Comedy club...?\"</p>, <p>It was a fitting choice after a little bit of thought.</p>, <p>It probably had to do with his powers.</p>, <p>The stamp hovered over the application when...</p>, <p>\"Maybe not.\"</p>, <p>She stopped herself.</p>, <p>Though her assumptions about him had yet to be proven, she still didn't feel reassured to leave him to his own devices.</p>, <p>Therefore.....</p>, <p>\"Hold.\"</p>, <p>She put the application on hold.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Tak. Tak—</p>, <p>For the next half hour, she sorted through the documents in front of her.</p>, <p>By the time she was done, her head throbbed. Reaching out for her drawer, wrappers scattered on the ground when she opened it. Not minding it, she inserted her hand in and dug through the mess before finally finding what she wanted—A chocolate bar.</p>, <p>The most peculiar part of the bar was the sticker that stuck on top of it.</p>, <p>It said, 'Property of Delilah'.</p>, <p>Yeah, because this was her bar.</p>, <p>She bit into the bar.</p>, <p>\"Haaa...\"</p>, <p>Only then did her expression relax, and so did her shoulders.</p>, <p>Finally, she redirected her attention to her desk, where a crystal device sat. It was glowing faintly. Shoving the chocolate into her mouth, she tapped on it.</p>, <p>A voice echoed across the room shortly after.</p>, <p>[...Delilah]</p>, <p>It was deep and filled with authority.</p>, <p>Tossing the wrapper, Delilah replied flatly,</p>, <p>\"I took care of the problem.\"</p>, <p>[What was it this time?]</p>, <p>\"Still manageable... Nothing much yet. A Terror Rank.\"</p>, <p>[.....Terror Rank?]</p>, <p>A certain gravity seized the room after Delilah's words.</p>, <p>A specific classification existed for those originating from the Mirror Dimension.</p>, <p>It was one that the four Empires came to a consensus with.</p>, <p>The ranks were as follows: Infant Rank, Junior Rank, Terror Rank, Destroyer Rank, and Primordial Rank.</p>, <p>The fact that a 'Terror Rank' beast had shown up near the premises of the Institute served as a deep reminder of how grave the situation was.</p>, <p>[It seems like they're becoming bolder and bolder. When was the last time they sent someone this powerful?]</p>, <p>\"Maybe a couple of years ago? I'm not sure.\"</p>, <p>As she spoke, Delilah's hand reached out for her drawer again, and she took out yet another chocolate bar.</p>, <p>\"...But it wasn't anything worth paying attention to.\"</p>, <p>A Terror Rank was a monster that had the equivalent power of a High Wizard.</p>, <p>Her trivialization of its power showed just how powerful she was.</p>, <p>[Were there any other problems...?]</p>, <p>Delilah pondered before carefully saying,</p>, <p>\"...It seems like they're planning something, but I'm not quite sure what. I've already raised the security of the institute, so we shouldn't have any problems, but you might never know.\"</p>, <p>[Yes... Make sure to keep alert. We've already stopped many attempts over the years, but you might never know when they will make a breakthrough.]</p>, <p>\"Understood.\"</p>, <p>The call seemed to end on that note, and just as Delilah planned to end it, she heard his voice again,</p>, <p>[.....Oh, there should be a gathering tonight. Are you going to be attending?]</p>, <p>\"Gathering?\"</p>, <p>[Did you forget?]</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>[So you did...]</p>, <p>\"I didn't.\"</p>, <p>For some reason, Delilah felt the need to deny it.</p>, <p>Her pride wasn't allowing her to admit that she had forgotten.</p>, <p>Because...</p>, <p>She really had forgotten.</p>, <p>[Oh, that's good. I'll be seeing you there, then. I'll be going now, and... clean your mouth.]</p>, <p>\"....Uh?\"</p>, <p>The call ended on that note.</p>, <p>Stunned, Delilah reached for her lips, where traces of the chocolate remained.</p>, <p>Her brows slowly knit together.</p>, <p>\"How did he know...?\"</p>, <p>***</p>, <p>It was late into the night when I reached the destination.</p>, <p>Since it wasn't far, we walked along the campus road to get to the place.</p>, <p>The venue sat at the Academy's outskirts amidst a cluster of villas. The chosen gathering spot distinguished itself effortlessly.</p>, <p>Towering over its neighbors, this particular villa not only boasted impressive size but also flaunted intricate decorations. Bright lights strategically placed accentuated this further, setting it apart from the others.</p>, <p>\"We're here.\"</p>, <p>Having rehearsed the situation beforehand, Leon went ahead of me and handed over our letters to the butler in charge.</p>, <p>He was a young man with black hair, perhaps about my age.</p>, <p>\"It's a pleasure to meet you, Black Star.\"</p>, <p>The butler greeted me after a quick look at the invitation.</p>, <p>His welcoming smile felt rather burdensome as he extended his hand toward the door of the villa, where he proceeded to open it.</p>, <p>[The son of the third head of the Evenus Barony. A first-year cadet and the Black Star. Julien Dacre Evenus.]</p>, <p>Having already been briefed beforehand by Leon, I wasn't startled by the sudden announcement.</p>, <p>I was, however, struggling to keep my face composed.</p>, <p>'I know this is something nobles do... But does it really need to be this exaggerated?'</p>, <p>There was also the issue regarding all the attendees who were now directing their attention toward me.</p>, <p>\"Please have a pleasant night.\"</p>, <p>The butler added. As if he was trying to add salt to my wounds.</p>, <p>\"Huuuu...\"</p>, <p>Taking a deep breath, I proceeded forward toward the hall.</p>, <p>I once again reminded myself of my identity.</p>, <p>'I'm Julien Dacre Evenus.'</p>, <p>'The Black Star and the number one ranked cadet in the first years.'</p>, <p>'When people look at me, they are the ones who grow nervous.'</p>, <p>'Not me.'</p>, <p>And with such thoughts, I headed deeper into the venue.</p>, <p>There were a lot of familiar faces as I moved forward. From members of my class to some of the staff and professors I had met over the past week. There were also many unfamiliar faces. Some old and some young.</p>, <p>But there was one person that stood out the most out of all of them.</p>, <p>She seemed to be the center of attention.</p>, <p>The one where the focus gravitated toward.</p>, <p>Aoife K. Megrail.</p>, <p>The Empire's one and only princess.</p>, <p>In a one-piece red dress that accentuated her striking red hair, she stood out, her beauty eclipsing many of those present.</p>, <p>Graceful movements and an elegant demeanor added to her image as she eloquently conversed with those engaging her in conversation.</p>, <p>\"...\"</p>, <p>Just as I noticed her, she noticed me. I thought nothing of it and prepared to look away when, all of a sudden, she smiled.</p>, <p>Smiled...?</p>, <p>I was momentarily taken aback.</p>, <p>So did the many that were looking at her.</p>, <p>By the time I regained my senses, she was standing in front of me. I felt the attention of all those present in the room.</p>, <p>...And just as I looked down to wonder what was happening, her glossy lips parted open, and her crisp voice gently reached my ears.</p>, <p>\"I've been waiting for you.\"</p>, <p>She extended her hand.</p>, <p>\".....Would you give me the honor?\"</p>, <p>The fuc—</p>]\n",
